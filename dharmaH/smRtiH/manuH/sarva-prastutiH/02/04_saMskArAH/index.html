<p>Here we have the recapitulation of all that has gone before,—and this
for the purpose of refreshing the memory.</p>
<p>‘<em>Yoniḥ</em>’—‘<em>source</em>,’ <em>cause</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Samāśena</em>’—‘<em>briefly</em>,’ <em>in brief</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Sambhavaśca</em>’—‘<em>also the origin</em>’—this refers to what has gone in
Discourse I.</p>
<p>‘<em>Of all this</em>’—this refers to the ‘creation of the world,’ which is
recalled in the form of a mental picture, and thus brought before the
eye (which makes it capable of being referred to by the pronoun ‘this’).</p>
<p>‘<em>The duties of the several castes</em>’—The duties that should he performed
by the various castes.</p>
<p>‘<em>Learn</em>’—<em>i.e</em>. in detail.</p>
<p>In this connection, the author of the <em>Smṛtivivaraṇa</em> describes five
kinds of <em>Dharma</em> or Duty:—</p>
<ol>
<li>‘<em>Varṇa-dharma</em>,’ ‘duties pertaining to caste;’</li>
<li>‘<em>Āśrama-dharma</em>,’ ‘Duties pertaining to Life-stages,’</li>
<li>‘<em>Varṇāśrama-dharma</em>,’ ‘duties pertaining to caste and life-stage’;</li>
<li>‘<em>Naimittika-Dharma</em>,’ ‘Occasional Duties,’</li>
<li>and ‘<em>Guṇa-Dharma</em>’ ‘Duties pertaining to qualification.’—</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Of these, that which proceeds entirely on the basis of caste, and
takes no account of age, life-stage or any such circumstances, is called
‘duty pertaining to castes;’ <em>e.g</em>., what is laid down in such rules
as—‘the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> should not be killed,’ ‘wine shall not be drank by
the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em>’—refers to a particular caste only, and is meant to apply
to every person of that caste till his very last breath.</p>
<p>(2) ‘Duty pertaining to life-stage’ is that which does not depend upon
caste only, but takes account of a particular life-stage also; <em>e.g</em>.,
‘Fire-kindling and alms-begging are the duties of the Vedic student’
(<em>Gautama</em> 2.8).</p>
<p>(3) ‘Duty pertaining to caste and life-stage’ is that which is related
to both; <em>e g</em>., when it is prescribed that ‘the bow-string made of
grass is the girdle for the Kṣatriya student,’ it means that what is
mentioned does not apply to any other life-stage (than that of the
student), nor to any other caste (except the Kṣatriya);—what is meant to
he the example here is the <em>wearing</em> of the girdle during student-life,
not the <em>first</em> taking of it, which forms part of the <em>Upanayana-rites</em>,
and does not pertaiṇ to the particular life-stage; and the <em>Upanayana</em>
itself is what ushers in a particular life-stage, and it is not a ‘duty
pertaining to the life-stage.’</p>
<p>(4) The ‘Occasional Duty’ consists of such acts as the <em>purifying of
things</em> and so forth.</p>
<p>(5) ‘Duty pertaining to qualifications’ is that which is presented in
connection with special qualifications; <em>e.g</em>., what is laid down in
such rules as ‘he should be absolved from six’ is with reference to the
qualification of ‘vast learning;’ to this same category belong also all
those duties that are laid down for the ‘annointed’ Kṣatriya.</p>
<p>All these are meant to be included under the ‘<em>of the castes</em>’
(mentioned in the text); and hence the text mentions those only; and it
does not make mention of the sub-divisions, because in the first place
there are endless subdivisions, and secondly, (if the text went about
mentioning all possible kinds of duties) it would have to mention those
many duties also which are laid down for men in general, without
reference to any particular caste. Similarly with other varieties of
‘Duty.’ In fact the ‘Duties pertaining to castes’ have been mentioned
only as an indication; it does not mean that the duties of the mixed
castes are excluded from consideration; because this latter has also
been promised (in 1.2) as the subject to lie expounded; and the present
statement is only meant to be the reiteration of that promise.—(25)</p>

<p>‘<em>Dharmasya</em>’—Govindarāja alone takes this to mean ‘spiritual merit
others agree in taking it as ‘duties</p>
<p><em>Medhātithi</em> (p. 78,1.28)—‘<em>Iha pañcaprakāro dharmoḥ</em>’—This view is here
attributed to the author of the <em>Smṛtivivaraṇa</em>. Kullūka quotes the
<em>Bhaviṣyapurāṇa</em> to the same effect.</p>
<p>Modern writers and lecturers on what they call ‘<em>Varṇā-śramadharma</em>’
should note the exact connotation of this name, as here explained by
Medhātithi.</p>

<p>For the twice-born persons corporeal consecration, beginning with ‘Conception,’ should be performed with auspicious Vedic rites; it purifies in this world and also after death.—(26)</p>

<p>The ‘<em>Vedic rites</em>’ spoken of here are <em>mantra-recitations</em>. ‘<em>Veda</em>’
here stands for <em>mantras</em>; and what ‘arises out of them’ (which is what
is expressed by the affix in ‘<em>Vaidikaiḥ</em>’) is the ‘reciting’; hence the
nominal affix ‘<em>ṭhañ</em>’ comes under the provisions of the Vārtika on
Pāṇini, 4. 3. 60.</p>
<p>Or, the word ‘<em>vaidika</em>’ (Vedic) may he taken as figuratively applied to
the <em>rites</em>, on the ground of their source lying in the Veda. ‘<em>Karma</em>,’
‘Rites,’ would, in this case, stand for the <em>act</em> constituting the
procedure; and hence becomes possible the differentiation and the
relation of cause and effect (between the <em>Karma</em> and the <em>Saṁskāra</em>
which is expressed in the assertion—‘the consecration, <em>saṁskāra</em>,
should he performed <em>by means of</em> the Rites?</p>
<p>‘<em>Conception</em>’—is the depositing of the semen in the womb, and
‘<em>niṣekādiḥ</em>’ stands for that body of sacraments to he described below,
which liegins with the said ‘Conception’ and ends with ‘Initiation’ (
<em>Upanayana</em>). The singular number in ‘<em>Śarīrasaṁskāraḥ</em>,’ ‘corporeal
consecration,’ is due to the whole body of sacraments being taken
collectively. ‘<em>Consecration</em>’ means the preparation of a qualified
body; and the Eeveral sacraments serve to produce in the body special
qualifications.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the term ‘<em>pāvanaḥ</em>,’ ‘<em>it nurifies</em>,’ removes
impurities.</p>
<p>‘<em>In</em> <em>this world</em> <em>and also after death</em>’.—This means that the person
duly consecrated becomes entitled to the performance of all those acts
that, like the <em>Kārīri</em> and other sacrifices, lead to material results,
-as also those that, like the Jyotiṣṭoma etc., bring spiritual rewards;
and hence the consecrations are of use in both worlds.</p>
<p>‘<em>Puṇyaiḥ</em>’—‘<em>auspicious</em>,’ <em>ie</em>., propitious; <em>i.e</em>., they bring good
luck and remove bad luck. Thus there is a clear difference between the
word ‘<em>puṇy</em> <em>a</em>’ and ‘<em>pāvana</em>’ here.</p>
<p>‘<em>For the twice-born persons</em>,’—this serves to exclude the <em>Śūdras</em>.
This word serves to point out who are the persons to be consecrated; and
it is only by indirect indication that the three higher castes arc
understood to be meant; for before consecration, they are not yet
‘twice-born’ (the ‘second birth’ consisting of the consecration).—(26)</p>

<p>‘<em>Vaidikaiḥ karmabhiḥ</em>’.—The term ‘<em>vaidika-karma</em>’ here stands for
<em>Vedic mantras</em>;—or for rites prescribed in the Veda. Both explanations
are found in Medhātithi and Govindarāja; Kullūka notes only the latter
explanation.</p>
<p>This verse has been quoted in the <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 132) as
laying down the necessity of performing the <em>Saṃskāras</em>. Here also both
the above explanations are noted.—It explains the term ‘<em>śarīra</em>’ in the
compound ‘<em>Śarīrasaṃskāraḥ</em>’ to stand for the <em>constituents of the
body</em>.—‘<em>In this world and also after death</em>’—has been explained as
implying that the Saṃskāras help ‘after death’ by enabling the man to
perform such sacrifices as lead him to heaven, and they help ‘in this
world’ by enabling him to perform such sacrifices as the <em>Kārīrī</em> and
the like, which bring desirable results in the world, in the shape of
rain, children and so forth.—It is quoted in the <em>Smṛticandrikā</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 36), to the effect that sacramental rites are performed
with Vedic Mantras in the ease of the <em>Twice-bom</em> persons only; it adds
that these sacraments are called ‘<em>pāvana</em>’, ‘purificatory’ of the
person, because, performed with Vedic Mantras, they serve to destroy
sins.</p>

<p>Of twice-born men the taint of seed and womb is removed by the ‘Libations in connection with Pregnancy’ and by ‘Jātakarman’ (Rites attendant upon birth), ‘Chauḍa’ (Tonsure) and ‘Mauñjībandhana’ (Tying of the grass-girdle). (27)</p>
<p>“How can these sacraments be regarded as subserving the purposes of actions? As regards the ‘sprinkling of butter,’ it is only natural that through the butter it should subserve the purposes of the sacrificial act, in Connection with which it has been prescribed. These sacraments however lie entirely, outside the pale of any action;—their injunction not occurring in the context of any sacrificial act. So it is difficult to say that they help in the sacrifice through the man (in the way in which the does through the butter). And unless it subserves the purposes of an act, consecration cannot be performed for its own sake; as in that case it should cease to be a ‘consecration’ (which is always subsidiary to something else), and become a primary act itself, and (when it ceases to be a consecration) this would mean the nullification of the statement ‘corporeal consecration should be performed’ (verse 26), and also of the Accusative ending in the statement ‘when, the boy is born, before he is touched by any other person, the father should etc.’ (which refers to the Birth-rites); and in that case, the sense of the injunction will have to be altered, as is done in the case of the injunction ‘Saktūñjuhoti’ [where the incompatibility of the Accusative ending leads us to alter it into the Instrumental ],—a particular result (as arising out of the consecration, as a primary act by itself) will have to be assumed; and so forth, a number of absurd assumptions will have to be made.”</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The statement that ‘corporeal consecration is purifying and auspicious’
has pointed out the use of the Sacraments Now, ‘purification’ consists
in removing the impurities of the impure thing; and the question
arises—“whence the impurity of the Body?”</p>
<p>It is in answer to this that the text speaks of ‘<em>the taint of seed and
womb</em>,’;—‘<em>of the seed</em>,’ is that which arises from, or is due to, the
seed;—similarly ‘of the womb’ (is that which arises from, or is due to,
the womb). ‘<em>Taint</em>’ is evil, an unseen source of pain. All that is
meant by this is that the Body is impure, owing its birth to the seed
and the womb. The ‘seed’ of man consists of semen and ovule; and these
by their very nature, are impure. Similarly the womb, is impure by
contamination. And the ‘<em>taint</em>’ of the man thus caused is ‘<em>removed?</em>
wiped away, by the sacraments.</p>
<p>These sacrameuts are now mentioned ; <em>some</em> are actually named, while
others are left to be indicated by the peculiar circumstances of what is
sanctified.</p>
<p>‘<em>Libations in connection with pregnancy</em>,’—thoso that are offered when
the pregnancy of the woman has come about,—or those that are offered for
the purpose of bringing about pregnancy; in either case the libations
are said to be ‘<em>in connection with pregnancy</em>.’ What prompts the
offering is the <em>pregnancy</em>, the woman being only a means to it; so that
the libations, being prompted by pregnancy, are said to be in connection
with it; and these are the rites of ‘<em>Pumsavana</em>,’ ‘<em>Sīmantonnayana</em>’
and ‘<em>Garbhādhāna</em>.’ The word ‘<em>libation</em>’ here stands for the whole
rite; as the ‘<em>Garbhādhāna</em>’ (‘Conception’) is certainly not a
‘Libation.’ The exact details of the rites, regarding the substances to
be offered, the duties and so forth—arc to be found out from the
<em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>.</p>
<p>Just as by the ‘libations in connection with pregnancy’. so also by the
sacrament known as ‘<em>Jātakarman</em>’ (Rites attendant upon birth).
Similarly by ‘<em>Tonsure</em>’;—‘<em>Chauḍa</em>,’ ‘<em>Tonsure</em>,’ is meant that which
is performed for the purpose of the ‘<em>cūḍā</em>’ (the- lock of hair left to
grow on the crown of the head). ‘<em>Tying of the gross-girdle</em>’ is
<em>Upanayana</em>; as it is at this ceremony that the girdle of muñja-grass is
tied, this indicates that rite. ‘<em>Nibandhana</em>’ is the same as
‘<em>bandhana</em>’; and the prefix ‘<em>ni</em>’ has been added for filling up the
metre.</p>
<p>‘<em>Jātakarman</em>’ and the rest—which are the names of the sacraments—have
been made into a copulative compound, and then have the instrumental
ending added to show that they are instrumental in the removal of taint.</p>
<hr>
<p>Every ‘consecration’ brings about some peculiarity, either seen
(material) or unseen (spiritual), in the thing consecrated, which is
subservient to something else to be brought about, and has either
already subserved, or is going to subserve, the purposes of this latter
thing. For instance, in the case of the ‘threshing of the corn’ and
‘offering sacrifices with the corn,’ the ‘threshing’ (which is the
‘consecration’ or ‘purification’ in this case) produces in the corns,
that are going to help in the accomplishment of the sacrifice, the
visible peculiarity, in the shape of the removal of the chaff. [So that
in this case the thing consecrated is going to subserve some useful
purpose]. When again it is said that ‘removing the garland from the
head one should keep it in a clean place,’ the garland is something that
has been used (and served its purpose) and has become mangled in shape;
so that the special method of its <em>disposal</em> (after use) only produces
an invisible effect. Now all the sacraments mentioned in the text are
prescribed for the purpose of the purification of the body; but they are
not found to bring about in the body any such effects as the removal of
bad odour, etc., which is done by washing with clay and water. Hence the
‘purification’ in this case should be understood to consist in some
unseen effect; just as has been held to result from the particular time
at which the birth of the individual takes place. And when the man has
become purified by such purification, he becomes fit for the performance
of acts prescribed in the <em>Smṛtis</em> and in the Vedas; just as the Butter
sanctified by <em>mantras</em> is fit for use in libations. In connection with
ordinary (non-religious) acts, all necessary purity is attained by the
(external) purification of things; as in the case of the Butter required
for eating. As for that ‘purity’ of the boy which consists in his
<em>touchabien?ss</em>, this is brought about by the ‘washing with water’
mentioned as the means of purifying the body (in 5.109). Hence has it
been declared that ‘there is no impurity arising from his touch.’</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>.—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can these sacraments be regarded as subserving the purposes of
actions? As regards the ‘sprinkling of butter,’ it is only natural
that through the butter it should subserve the purposes of the
sacrificial act, in Connection with which it has been prescribed.
These sacraments however lie entirely, outside the pale of any
action;—their injunction not occurring in the context of any
sacrificial act. So it is difficult to say that they help in the
sacrifice through the man (in the way in which the does through the
butter). And unless it subserves the purposes of an act, consecration
cannot be performed for its own sake; as in that case it should cease
to be a ‘consecration’ (which is always subsidiary to something else),
and become a <em>primary</em> act itself, and (when it ceases to be a
<em>consecration</em>) this would mean the nullification of the statement
‘corporeal consecration should be performed’ (verse 26), and also of
the Accusative ending in the statement ‘when, the boy is born, before
he is touched by any other person, the father should etc.’ (which
refers to the Birth-rites); and in that case, the sense of the
injunction will have to be altered, as is done in the case of the
injunction ‘<em>Saktūñjuhoti</em>’ [where the incompatibility of the
<em>Accusative</em> ending leads us to alter it into the <em>Instrumental</em> ],—a
particular result (as arising out of the consecration, as a primary
act by itself) will have to be assumed; and so forth, a number of
absurd assumptions will have to be made.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Our answer to the above is as follows:—What we mean by the consecration
subserving the purposes of sacrifices is-not that it is a subsidiary
integral part of these,—which character is indicated by Direct Vedic
Declaration and certain other means; all that we mean is that it is
helpful to it; and this helpfulness is possible even without the one
forming an integral part of the other. For instance, we have the
injunction regarding the ‘laying of fire’ and that relating to ‘Vedic
study’; but there is no Direct Injunction or any other indication (of
these forming part of any sacrifice); all that we find is the Vedic text
‘offerings are made into the which lays down the ‘<em>Āhavanīya</em>’ (as the
receptacle of the offerings); and as the precise nature of the
‘<em>Āhavanīya</em>’ is superphysical, the only way in which it can be brought
into existence is by means of the prescribed ‘laying of fire,’ which is
contained in the text ‘the Brāhmaṇa should lay the fires during spring’;
so that the ‘laying of fire’ helps in the sacrificial performance
through the bringing into existence of the <em>Āhavanīya</em>, and yet it does
not form an integral part of the performance. ‘Vedic study’ also helps
in the sacrificial performance, through the knowledge of the meaning of
Vedic texts (acquired by the study).</p>
<p>Analogous to these two is the case of the sacraments:</p>
<ol>
<li>the act of Vedic study can be done only by one who has had these
sacraments performed,</li>
<li>it is only when one has carried out the injunction of Vedic study
that he can marry,</li>
<li>it is only when one has married that he can ‘lay the fire,’</li>
<li>and it is only one who has ‘laid the fire’ that is entitled (to the
performance of sacrifices).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is in this way that even though the sacraments are laid down apart
from the sacrificial injunctions, yet their due performance is helpful
towards the sacrificial acts.</p>
<p>Since the text speaks of ‘<em>Niṣeka</em>’ (conception, depositing of the
semen) as the first of the sacraments, it follows that all the
sacraments for the child are to be performed by the father. Thus the
<em>mantra</em> for the ‘Rites on Birth’ reads—‘You are my very soul, bearing
the name of son’ (<em>Śatapatha</em> <em>Brāhmaṇa</em>, 14. 9. 4. 8.) [which clearly
shows that it is recited by the father]. It is for the father again
that the begetting and instructing of children has been prescribed as a
duty in the verse—‘Having paid off the three debts etc.,’ (6.35); and
the passage. It is for this reason that the duly instructed son is
called the real son,’ speaks of ‘instruction,’ which consists in
teaching the boy his duties; and we shall show later on that this
‘instruction’ is accomplished only by teaching hi m the Veda up to the
point where the boy comprehends its full meaning. It is thus that the
sacraments are of use to both: they help the father in the begetting of
the right sort of child, and they help the boy in the performance of
those acts that can be done only by one who has been duly consecrated.
Thus it is the father on whom devolves the task of having the sacraments
properly performed; and on his death, for hi m who takes his place; for
instance, it is said ‘he who h as not been consecrated should be
consecrated by his brothers who have had their consecration already
done.’ (<em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 2.124).—(27)</p>

the sacraments of the Boy are helpful:—</p>

taken to mean that the Sacramental Rites are meant only for the

have been mentioned after the injunction of <em>Upanayaṇa</em> which pertains
to the Twice-born only. It is quoted in the Smṛtikaumudī (p. 48), which
notes that the term ‘<em>Saṃskāra</em>’ (Sacrament) connotes <em>destruction of

<p>This body is made godly,—by a thorough study of the three Vedas, by Observances, by libations, by offerings, by children, by the Great Sacrifices and by the Sacrifices. (28)</p>
<p>“Nowhere in the Veda is the attaining of Brahman declared to be the reward of the actions here enumerated. For instance, (A) as for the compulsory acts, they are prescribed as being without rewards. If we.were to assume rewards, such an assumption would be purely human in its source (and as such not authoritative). And since the Veda has declared them to be compulsory by means of such phrases ‘throughout one’s life’ and the like, there can be no justification for applying the principle.of the V sacrifice (and assume the reward to consist in the attaining of heaven). If it were argued that—‘from the present verse of Manu itself we learn that the said Acts bring the mentioned rewards,’—then it would come to this that only such persons are entitled to these acts as long for Final Release; which would deprive them of their compulsory character; and this would be contrary to what has been declared in the Veda. It may be argued that—‘inasmuch as no one ever undertakes a fruitless act, (if no rewards were mentioned) the laying down of the acts would be futile.’ ‘But there may be no performance at all; that does not matter; the use of a ‘source of knowledge’ lies in making things known; if it has succeeded in doing this, its purpose has been served; and the present verse does clearly indicate some acts as to be done; and if this indication is accomplished (the purpose of the scriptural injunction has been served); if people do not perform those acts, they transgress the behests of the scripture, and thereby incur sin. All old writers have explained the sense of the Injunctive etc., on these lines. If a servant does not perform his duty, as he is ordered to doby his master, cither he does not obtain his wages, or he incurs sin. Now as regards the compulsory acts, since no rewards are mentioned (in the form of wages), the evil that follows is not in the form of losing the reward, but in the form of suffering pain. It is only in this manner that we can explain the fact of, all men being required to perform the compulsory acts. From all this it follows that in the case of compulsory acts there is no reward. (B) As regards the optional acts, other results have boen declared as following from them, and not Fin l Release (the one mentioned here). How then could this Final Release be such an end of man as is accomplished by the mere performance of acts?”</p>
<p>“How is it then that Gautama (8. 8) has spoken of ‘forty sacraments’? There the Soma-sacrifice also has been mentioned as a sacrament; and certainly a primary sacrifice (as the Soma-sacrifice undoubtedly is) can never have the character of a mere consecratory sacrament. Nor is it possible to take this part of Gautama’s Sutra as an arthavāda; as all the forty sacraments are spoken of as being on the same footing.”</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The term ‘<em>svādhyāya</em>’ here stands for the <em>act of studying</em> (in
general; and not for <em>Vedic study</em>, which is what it ordinarily means);
and the subject-matter of the study is therefore indicated by the term
‘<em>of theThree Vedas</em>,’ ‘<em>traividyena</em>.’ Even though the two terms
(‘<em>svādhyāyena</em>’ and ‘<em>traividyena</em>’) do not stand in close proximity,
yet they are construed together on account of their denotations being
correlated, in accordance with the law that ‘when the denotation of one
term is connected with that of another, they should be taken as
correlated.’ Hence, even though both the terms are in the same
(Instrumental) case, yet one (<em>traividyena</em>) may be taken as denoting
the object of the other (<em>svādhyāyena</em>) by altering the signification of
the case-ending; the phrase ‘<em>traividyena svādhyāyena</em>’ thus being
construed as ‘<em>trayāṇām Vedānām (traividyasya) adhyayanena
(svādhyāyena</em>),’ ‘<em>by a thorough study of the three Vedas</em>’</p>
<p>‘<em>Traividya</em>’ is the compounded form of ‘<em>trayo</em>’; the formation of the
term being similar to that of such terms as ‘<em>chaturvarṇya</em>’ and the
rest.</p>
<p>Or, ‘<em>svādhyāyena&rsquo;</em> may be taken (as usual) in the sense of the <em>study
of the verbal text of the Vedas</em>, and ‘<em>traividyena&rsquo;</em> in that of the
study of their meaning.</p>
<p>‘<em>By Observances</em>’—by the ‘<em>Sāvitra</em>’ and other observances kept by the
Religious Student.</p>
<p>‘<em>By Libations</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., those that are poured at the time of the
Initiation,—or the kindling of fire with fuels, which the Religious
Student has to do every morning and evening, may be spoken as
‘<em>libation</em>,’ on account of Fire being the receptacle of the act of
kindling (just as it is of the act of pouring libations).</p>
<p>“Is not the putting of fuel on the fire really a ‘libation’—that you
should call it so simply from the said analogy?”</p>
<p>People say that it is not really a ‘libation because ‘libations’ and
‘offerings’ consist only of eatable substances.</p>
<p>“How then does the author himself say (under 2.186) that ‘the Religious
Student should, every morning and evening <em>offer the libation (juhuyāt</em>)
of fuels into the Fire’?”</p>
<p>It is only in a figurative sense that the ‘laying of fuel’ is called
‘<em>homa</em>’, ‘libation’; the idea being that the fuel for the kindling of
fire is thrown into it in the same manner as substances are poured as
libations; and it is on the basis of this analogy that the <em>kindling</em> is
called ‘<em>libation</em>’ In the original injunction (of fire-kindling) the
words used are ‘<em>sami</em> <em>dham-ādadhyat</em>,’ ‘should lay the fuel’ [where
the word ‘<em>homa</em>,’ ‘libation’ is not used]. As for the words (in Manu,
2.186) ‘<em>agnim juhuyāt tābhih</em>,’ (‘should offer the libation of fuels
into fire’), we shall point out later on that they are purely
explanatory (not mandatory), and mean something quite different; and in
explanations, figurative expressions are not out of place.</p>
<p>[This is the view of some people]. The right view however is that the
offering of any fit and proper substance constitutes the acts of
‘<em>Yāga</em>’ (Sacrifice) and ‘<em>Homa</em>’ (Libation). It is only in this sense
that we can rightly comprehend several injunctions. For instance, we
have the injunction ‘<em>praitaram praharati</em>,’ where ‘<em>praharati</em>,’ is
taken to mean ‘offer in sacrifice’ and ‘<em>prastaram</em>’ (‘bed of
Kuśa-grass’) is taken as the substance offered [and certainly the
‘Kuśa-bed’ is not an <em>eatable</em> substance],</p>
<p>“In this particular instance, we have to take the ‘sacrifice’ as
consisting of the offering of the Grass-bed, simply because it is so
directly enjoined. And further, <em>Kuśa-grass</em> also is eatable for some.”</p>
<p>Well, how is it then in the case of the ‘<em>Śākala-homa</em>’ (where <em>pebbles</em>
are offered)?”</p>
<p>“In that case also it has to be done in that way, because of the direct
injunction—‘one should offer the pebbles’.”</p>
<p>What explanation can there be of the case of the ‘<em>Grahayāga</em>,’ where
fuels of the <em>arka</em> and other plants are offered to each of the Grahas?</p>
<p>From all this it is clear that wherever we have the term ‘<em>juhuyāt</em>’
(‘should offer libation’) and the connection of a Deity also is
mentioned, in the original Injunction, the act is to be regarded as
‘<em>Homa</em>,’ ‘Libation.’</p>
<p>‘<em>By offerings</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., by offerings to the Gods and <em>Ṛṣis</em>.</p>
<p>Up to this point we had the duties of the Religious Student.</p>
<p>Next follow the duties of the Householder.</p>
<p>‘<em>By children</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., by the act of begetting children.</p>
<p>‘<em>By the great sacrifices</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., by the five ‘sacrifices,’ consisting
of <em>Brahtnayajña</em> and the rest.</p>
<p>‘<em>By sacrifices</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., by the <em>Jyotiṣṭoma</em> and other Vedic
Sacrifices.</p>
<p>The question being raised that—“if there were any useful purpose served
by these acts, then alone could there be any use for the sacraments
which fit a man for these acts,”—the Author says—‘<em>this body is made
godly,’ ‘tanuḥ</em>.’—‘<em>Brahma</em>’ here stands for the Supreme God, the
Creator; and this ‘<em>tanu</em>,’ body, is made ‘related to God,’
‘<em>godly</em>,’—by all these acts, which are laid down in the Veda and in the
<em>Smṛtis</em>. ‘<em>Godliness</em>’ meant here is that which consists in <em>being
transformed into the very essence of God</em>; as this is the highest end of
man; as for other forms of ‘relation to God,’ this is already an
accomplished fact for all beings,—for the simple reason that God is the
Creator of all things; and hence these other relations cannot be
anything to be longed for. For this reason it is the attainment of
‘Final Release’ that must be meant here.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>brāhmī</em>,’ ‘godly’—as also the term ‘<em>tanu</em>,’ ‘body’—refers to
the personality ensouling the body; as it is the personality that is
consecrated by the sacraments; and it is the personality that attains
Final Release; as for the physical body, it entirely perishes.</p>
<p>Others have explained the phrase ‘<em>it made godly</em>’ to mean that ‘it is
made capable of reaching Brahma as (they argue) the actual ‘<em>becoming
Brahman</em>’ is not possible by means of acts alone; Final Release (which
is what is meant by⁽becoming Brahman’) is&rsquo;attainable only by means of
<em>Knowledge</em> and <em>Action</em> conjointly. Hence what the text means is that
the man, by the said acts, becomes entitled to meditate upon <em>Ātman</em>
(Brahman). To this end we have the Vedic text—‘O Gārgi, when anyone,
without knowing the Imperishable One, sacrifices, pours oblations,
performs penances, studies the Veda or gives charities, all this becomes
perishable’ (<em>Bṛha</em> <em>dāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em>, 3. 8. 10).</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Objection</em>.—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nowhere in the Veda is the <em>attaining of Brahman</em> declared to be the
reward of the actions here enumerated. For instance, (A) as for the
<em>compulsory</em> acts, they are prescribed as being without rewards. If
we.were to assume rewards, such an assumption would be purely human in
its source (and as such not authoritative). And since the Veda has
declared them to be <em>compulsory</em> by means of such phrases ‘throughout
one’s life’ and the like, there can be no justification for applying
the principle.of the <em>V</em> sacrifice (and assume the reward to consist
in the attaining of heaven). If it were argued that—‘from the present
verse of Manu itself we learn that the said Acts bring the mentioned
rewards,’—then it would come to this that only such persons are
entitled to these acts as long for Final Release; which would deprive
them of their compulsory character; and this would be contrary to what
has been declared in the Veda. It may be argued that—‘inasmuch as no
one ever undertakes a fruitless act, (if no rewards were mentioned)
the laying down of the acts would be futile.’ ‘But there may be no
performance at all; that does not matter; the use of a ‘source of
knowledge’ lies in making things known; if it has succeeded in doing
this, its purpose has been served; and the present verse does clearly
indicate some acts as to be done; and if this indication is
accomplished (the purpose of the scriptural injunction has been
served); if people do not perform those acts, they transgress the
behests of the scripture, and thereby incur sin. All old writers have
explained the sense of the Injunctive etc., on these lines. If a
servant does not perform his duty, as he is ordered to doby his
master, cither he does not obtain his wages, or he incurs sin. Now as
regards the compulsory acts, since no rewards are mentioned (in the
form of wages), the evil that follows is not in the form of losing the
reward, but in the form of suffering pain. It is only in this manner
that we can explain the fact of, <em>all men</em> being required to perform
the compulsory acts. From all this it follows that in the case of
compulsory acts there is no reward. (B) As regards the <em>optional</em>
acts, other results have boen declared as following from them, and not
<em>Fin l Release</em> (the one mentioned here). How then could this Final
Release be such an end of man as is accomplished by the mere
performance of acts?”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is just in view of these considerations that the text has been
explained as a mere ‘<em>arthavāda</em>,’ meant to eulogise the injunction of
the Sacraments.</p>
<p>Some people have taken the expression ‘godly’ figuratively—on some basis
or other—to mean ‘capable of reciting the Veda and of performing the
acts prescribed in the Veda’; ‘<em>brahma</em>’ being taken as equivalent to
‘Veda.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How is it then that Gautama (8. 8) has spoken of ‘forty sacraments’?
There the <em>Soma-sacrifice</em> also has been mentioned as a <em>sacrament</em>;
and certainly a primary sacrifice (as the Soma-sacrifice undoubtedly
is) can never have the character of a mere consecratory sacrament. Nor
is it possible to take this part of Gautama’s Sutra as an <em>arthavāda</em>;
as all the forty sacraments are spoken of as being on the same
footing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, the statement of Gautama is purely commendatory,
the Soma-sacrifice being spoken as a ‘sacrament’ in the sense that it
brings about in the performer’s soul a peculiar aptitude.</p>
<p>Similarly in the present context real Sacraments have been mentioned
along with non-sacraments with a view to indicate that both equally lead
to the same result; and the purpose served by this is to show that the
performance of all of them is necessary. It is thus not necesary to take
the verse as apart from the section dealing with Sacraments.</p>
<p>Then again, the term ‘<em>is made</em>’ is meant to be commendatory, as is
shown by the fact that we have the present tense, and not the injunctive
affix. So that there is nothing to justify the idea that ‘the attaining
of Brahman’ is the reward (of what is enjoined). In fact the present
verse does not enjoin any actions; and hence there cannot arise any
desire on our part to know their result, which could justify the
assumption that the present tense has the force of the Injunctive; as
has been done in the case of the <em>Rātrīsatra</em>, in connection with which
even though we have the present tense in the term ‘<em>pratit ṣṭhanṭi</em>’
(‘obtain a standing’), yet it is taken as laying down the result
following from the Bātrisatra.</p>
<p>From all this it follows that all that is said in the verse is for the
eulogising of the Sacraments.</p>
<p>Some people interpret the verse by breaking it up into two parts—taking
it to mean that ‘the attaining of Brahman is the reward of the
compulsory acts, and of the optional acts the rewards are such as are
actually mentioned in the Veda along with these acts.’</p>
<p>But there is no authority for this; because the entire verse is purely
commendatory: specially as it has been already explained that the
compulsory acts are performed without the idea of any rewards. It is in
view of this that our Author has said (under 2.2) that ‘it is not right
to be absorbed in desires.’—(28)</p>

mark.</p>

sanctificatory of the food that has been cooked.</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>‘<em>Vardhana</em>’ is <em>cutting</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Jātakarma</em>’ is the name of the particular rite. The exact form of this
rite is to be learnt from the <em>Gṛhya-sūtras</em>, In answer to the question
as to which is the act to which the name ‘Jāta-karma’ is applied, the
author adds—‘the <em>feeding with gold, honey and butter?</em>.’ ‘<em>Of him</em>’
refers to the child; or, it may refer to the rite; the sense being that
‘<em>of</em> <em>rite</em>’ of Jāta-karma, the principal part consists in the feeding
of the child <em>to the accompaniment of mantras</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>To the accompaniment of mantras’,—i.e</em>., the act should be done along
with the reciting of mantras. Though the present text does not specify
the mantras, yet, since all <em>Smṛtis</em> have the same end in view, we must
accept those same mantras that are prescribed in other <em>Smṛtis</em>. Hence
it follows that the mantras that should be recited are those that have
been mentioned in the <em>Gṛhya-sūtras</em>.</p>
<p>“If it is necessary to call in the aid of the <em>Gṛhya-sūtras</em>, the
substances (Gold, Honey and Butter) also need not have been mentioned
here; as in the <em>Gṛhya-sūtra</em> we find the following words (in
Apastamba’s <em>Gṛhya-sūtra</em>, 1.15.1).—‘The child should be made to eat
butter, honey and the essence of gold with a golden ladle, with the
mantra, <em>Prati dadāmi madhuno ghṛtaṣya</em> etc.’ Further, there are many
<em>Gṛhya-sūtras</em>; the mantras also that are prescribed in the various
<em>Gṛhyaṣūtras</em> are different; the very procedure of the rite is variously
prescribed; so that (if we were to seek for information from the
<em>Gṛhyas</em>) we would fail to know which one of these we should adopt. It
might he argued that the name of the particular Vedic Rescension (which
the performer has studied and with which a particular <em>Gṛhyasūtra</em> is
connected) would help to determine the exact procedure to be adopted.
But in that case, there can be no use in Manu laying down the
‘Birth-rite’ and the other sacraments; as these also could be learnt
from the <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em> themselves. Every <em>sūtra</em> is named after a
particular Vedic Rescension,—<em>e.g</em>., ‘<em>Gṛhya</em> of the <em>Kaṭhas</em>,’ ‘<em>Gṛyya</em>
of the <em>Āśvalāyanas</em>’ and so forth; so that a man would naturally adopt
that procedure which is laid down in the <em>Gṛhya</em> that is named after the
Rescension to which he belongs.”</p>
<p>To the above our answer is as follows:—The fact that the substances
(Honey, etc.) mentioned in the text are just those prescribed in the
Gṛhyas in connection with the ‘<em>Jātakarma</em>,’ shows that the rites
mentioned (here and in the <em>Gṛhya</em>) are the same. This is what leads us
to the recognition that—‘the rite ordained here having the same name and
the same substances as those found in the <em>Gṛhyas</em>, this must be the
same as that.’ In several cases we recognise a thing through its
qualities. And when the rites are one and the same, if a certain detail
is not mentioned in one text, it has to be brought in from the other
text, specially when there is no inconsistency between the two. It has
been decided that th e act (of <em>Agnihotra</em>) prescribed in the several
rescensional Vedic texts is one and the same; and the analogy of this
leads us to conclude that the act (of the sacrament) as prescribed in
the several <em>Smṛtis</em> (of Manu and of the <em>Gṛhya-sūtras</em>) must be one and
the same. As regards the uncertainty that has been urged by the objector
as to the exact procedure to be adopted, in face of there being many,
<em>Gṛhyas</em> laying down diverse procedures,—our answer to that is that all
the <em>Gṛhyas</em> being equally authoritative, what one has got to do is that
when the details varying in them are those relating to the end, he may
adopt any one of them optionally, while if the details varying relate to
different purposes, he should employ them all. The name of the Vedic
Rescension can never form the determining factor. Because the name of
the Vedic text in relation to a particular individual is not such an
invariable factor as his ‘<em>yotra</em> and <em>pravara</em>’ are; for a man is
called after that Vedic Rescension which he happens to study: if he has
studied the ‘<em>Kāthaka</em>’ rescension he is called ‘<em>Kāṭhaka</em>,’ and if he
has studied the Ṛgveda, he is called ‘<em>Bahvṛca</em>’; and in regard to
studying there is no such hard and fast rule as that ‘such and such a
man should study only such and such a rescensional text.’ Then again, a
man very often studies several Vedic texts, as is ordained (by Manu, in
3.2)—‘Having studied the <em>Vedas</em> &amp;c. &amp;c. and one has studied all the
three Vedas comes to be known by all such names—as ‘<em>Ka?thuma</em>’
(Sāmavedin) ‘<em>Kāṭhāka</em>’ (Yajurvedin) and <em>Bahvṛca</em>’ (Ṛgvedin); and in
this case one must have recourse to option. For the man however who
studies a single Vedic text, it is only right that he should adopt the
procedure prescribed in the <em>Gṛhya</em> that is named after that Vedic text;
in fact, he <em>can</em> follow only that procedure; as he has studied only the
mantras occurring in that particular text; and these alone he can recite
(properly). In fact the only knowledge that he possesses of the Rite is
what is derived from that particular text.</p>
<p>“As for the man’s knowing the <em>mantras</em>, since the Veda is studied only
for the performance of the rites, the man would read up just those
mantras (also of the other texts) that might be used in a certain
performance.”</p>
<p>Our answer to this is that the study of the Veda is undertaken in virtue
of the Injunction of ‘Vedic study;’ and until one has studied the Veda,
he is not entitled to perform any religious act; it is not (as the
objector thinks) that the Veda is studied only for the performing of the
acts. In fact, the name that has been applied to the various <em>Gṛhyas</em>—as
‘this is the Gṛhya of the Kaṭhas,’ ‘this is the <em>Gṛhya</em> of the
<em>Vājasaneyins</em>’ and so forth—is simply for the purpose of indicating
what particular mantras have to be employed by certain persons; and when
the majority of mantras prescribed in a certain <em>Gṛhya</em> happen to be
those that have been read in a particular Vedic text, that <em>Gṛhya</em> comes
to be named after that text. Further, when <em>Gṛhya Smṛti</em> is a
trustworthy source of knowledge, even though it may be named after the
‘<em>Kaṭhas</em>,’ it cannot fail to make its purport known to the Ṛgvedins
also; and what forms the purport of the Vedas and the <em>Smṛtis</em> is that
‘such and such an act should be done.’ So that when one has come to know
that ‘this should be done,’ there can be nothing to limit the
performance of that act to any particular class of persons, unless there
is a Vedic text specifying any particular performer;—as for instance,
when the performance of the <em>Tanūnapāt Prayāja</em> is restricted to the
‘Vaśiṣṭha’ clan,—or a distinct prohibition sets aside the said
‘performability.’ Neither of these two circumstances is present in the
case in question. Nor can it presumed that the <em>Ṛgveda</em> is not an
authority for the <em>Kaṭhas</em>, <em>or vice versa</em>. Because until a particular
Vedic text has been actually studied, there is no difference between the
‘<em>Kaṭha</em>’ and the ‘<em>Non-Kaṭha</em>.’ As regards the ‘<em>Gotra</em>’ (the
Clan-name), this is fixed for each man (being determined by his birth).
So that the ‘<em>Gṛhya</em>’ of a man does not stand on the same footing as his
‘<em>Gotra</em>.’</p>
<p>This [that the <em>Gṛhya</em> of the man is that connected with the Vedic text
that he has studied] is what is meant by the assertion—‘He who
renounces his <em>won Gṛhyaṣūtra</em> and acts according to another
<em>Gṛhyasūtra</em> &amp;c.’ In fact the man can carry into practice the precepts
of that text only which he h as studied. Consequently if one were to
give up the rules of his own Vedic text to perform a rite in accordance
with the Vedic text studied by his forefathers, and adopt the procedure
laid down in the <em>Gṛhyas</em> belonging to this latter, he would incur the
sin of ‘renouncing his own Vedic text’; or in this case the sin of
‘renouncing the text’ will have been committed by the father who did not
teach the boy that particular text which had been continually studied in
his family; and no blame attaches, in this, to the boy himself. In a
case where the boy has lost his father and betakes himself to the
teacher, as Jābāla is described as having done, it would be right for
the Teacher to teach him that Text which had been studied in the boy’s
family,—in accordance with the law ‘one should proceed by the path by
which his father and grandfather have proceeded’ (<em>Manu</em>, 4.178); ‘and
the renouncing of the hereditary Vedic text’ would be justifiable only
in the event of its study being absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>From all this we deduce the following conclusion:—All the
sacraments—‘<em>Jātakarma</em>’ and the rest—have been prescribed in all the
Smṛtis; and where they lay down different details pertaining to diverse
purposes, they should all be employed; but when any such details pertain
to the same end and are mutually inconsistent, then there should be an
option as to the particular detail to be employed.</p>
<p>‘<em>Of the male child</em>’—is added with a view to exclude the female and the
sexless child.</p>
<p>Others however have held that there is no special significance attaching
to the masculine gender of the word; because the context refers to all
‘twice-born’ persons in general as to undergo the sacramental rites.
That which is meant to be ‘consecrated’ forms the principal factor; and
it has been decided that no significance attaches to any such
qualifications gender, number and the like, when applied to the
principal factor; <em>e.g</em>., even though the washing of the cups is laid
down in the words—‘one should wash the <em>cup</em>’ (in the singular),—yet
<em>all</em> the cups are washed. Similarly when it is laid down, that ‘the
<em>man</em> who is feverish, or just free from fever, should be fed at the
close of the day,’—the feverish <em>woman</em> also is fed at that same time;
and it is because the present verse affords the idea of the sacrament
being performed for females also that the Author has added the interdict
(in 2.66) that ‘the whole of this is to be done for women without
Mantras’ [otherwise, if the present verse itself had excluded the
women, there would be no point in this further interdict]. Then again,
marriage (which is also a sacrament) is actually spoken of (in 9. 203)
in connection with Eunuchs.</p>
<p>Our answer to the above is as follows:—The word ‘male’ does not denote
the ‘human’ genus in general, in the way that the word ‘man’ does; and
it is only if it did have that denotation that there might he some
ground for not attaching any significance to the gender expressed by the
particular case-ending. What the word ‘male’ denotes in all cases is a
particular gender in the form of <em>masculinity</em>, as pertaining to all
things, moving and unmoving, corporeal and incorporeal. In the present
case the gender is denoted by the basic noun (‘<em>pumān</em>’ in ‘<em>puruṣaḥ</em>’)
itself; and it is only in connection with what is denoted by the
case-ending, that the question of significance or non-significance can
arise; and the reason for this lies in the fact that the denotation of
<em>number</em> (or gender) is not the only function of the case-ending,—it may
have its use simply in the denoting of any one of several such factors
as the ‘accusative character’ and so forth [so that if no significance
is attached to any one of these several factors, it does not matter].
In the present case however (where the gender is denoted by the basic
noun itself), if no significance were attached to the gender, then the
word ‘<em>pumān</em>’ would become absolutely meaningless. As in the very
instance cited above, full significance is actually attached to the
denotation of the basic noun ‘<em>Cup</em>’; and this is done simply because
the sentence would, otherwise, become absolutely meaningless.</p>
<p>The following argument might be urged—“It is not only what is signified
by the case-ending that may be non-significant; as a matter of fact, the
denotation of the entire word, if it qualifies the subject, is regarded
as non-significant. For instance, in the case of the text which lays
down an expiatory rite in the case of one for whom ‘<em>both offering
materials</em> have been spoilt.’—though we have the word ‘both,’ yet the
expiatory rite is performed even on the spoiling of even one of the two
materials, milk and curd; and no significance is attached to the
denotation of the entire word ‘<em>both</em>’ (which qualifies the subject.)”</p>
<p>To this objection some people offer the following answer:—The present
case is not analogous to the case just cited. In the latter, the
‘<em>Pañcaśarāva</em> rite’ (which is the expiatory rite referred to) is not
done for the sake of the offering-material; all that is meant is that
the spoiling of the materials provides the occasion for the performance
of the rite;—while in the case in question, the sacraments are done for
the sake of the Boy.</p>
<p>This difference (between the two cases) however is of no consequence at
all. Because as a matter of fact, it is only with a view to avoid a
syntactical split that significance is not attached to qualifications;
and even though the Rite were for the sake of the material, that would
not prevent the said syntactical split.</p>
<p>Hence the real answer to the objection is as follows:—The passage
beginning with ‘<em>vaidikaiḥ karmabhiḥ</em>, etc.,’ (Verse 26) is what
constitutes the original injunction of the ‘<em>Jātakarma</em>’ sacrament; and
throughout this passage it is the <em>male</em> that is indicated as the person
to be ‘consecrated.’ So that if no significance were attached to this
<em>male-character</em>, the whole passage would become meaningless. It is this
same consideration which leads us (in the case of the passage cited by
the objection) to attach due significance to the denotation of the word
‘offering-material’ (even though none is attached to its qualification
‘both’).</p>
<p>“Well, then the sacraments would be performed for the <em>Śūdra</em> also; as
the passage does not specify any particular caste.”</p>
<p>Certainly there is no possibility of the sacraments for <em>Śūdras</em>,
because sacraments are performed to the accompaniment of <em>Mantras</em>. Or,
we may take the term ‘of the twice-born persons,’ occurring in a
supplementary passage, as providing the necessary restriction. Nor does
the term ‘of the twice-born persons’ in the said passage pertain (as a
qualification) only to what is therein enjoined; so that it cannot be
urged that, “in as much as the necessity of their consecration has been
mentioned in that passage, no significance can attach to the term ‘male’
in the present passage; just as none is attached to the term ‘both’ in
the passage referred to above.”</p>
<p>As for the fact of a later text (Verse 66) speaking of the Rites for
females being ‘without mantras,’ this could be taken as an independent
injunction; without necessarily depending upon the fact of the
‘sacrament <em>with mantras</em>’ being possible for women also (under the
present verse; of which the later verse has been regarded as an
exception, by the objector above).</p>
<p>As for the ‘marriage of sexless persons’;—‘sexless’ persons are of
various kinds—<em>e.g</em>., (<em>a</em>) those whose semen is ‘airy,’ (Impotent),
(<em>b</em>) those who have the signs of both sexes (Hermaphrodite), and (<em>c</em>)
those whose organs are inactive. All these people cannot be excluded
from all the ‘sacraments’; because, in the first place their
<em>impotence</em>, etc., cannot be detected at the time (during infancy) when
the ‘<em>Jātakarma</em>’ and the other (earlier) sacraments are performed; and
secondly (even when detected) the said impotence, etc., may be such as
might be cured, and certainly a characteristic that is not of a
permanent character can never serve as a disqualification. For instance,
<em>absence of wealth</em>; this is not a permanent characteristic, like the
<em>caste</em> of a person; for the man who has no wealth comes to acquire
wealth; having remained poor for a long time, a man becomes very rich in
a single day. It is on the killing of such a (confirmed and permanent)
eunuch that one becomes purified (of the sin) by the giving of a load of
dry grass; and the reason for this lies in the fact that he has had no
‘sacraments,’ he has not been ‘initiated,’ and his life is of no use to
any person.</p>
<p>From all this it follows that the present text prescribes the sacraments
for <em>males</em> only,—the later Verse (66) prescribes them for <em>females</em> as
to be done ‘without mantras,’—and for <em>eunuchs</em> there are no sacraments
at all.—(29)</p>

<p>‘<em>Hiranya-madhu-sarpisām</em>’—Though the text clearly says that the child
is to be fed with <em>gold, honey and butter</em>, it appears from the <em>Gṛhya
Sūtras</em> that the last two substances only are to be given to the child,
after they have been touched with a piece of gold.’—Buhler.</p>
<p>‘<em>Mantravat</em>.’—The mantras are those used by his own sect or his gurus.</p>
<p>Hopkins has the following note here:—“This commentator’s (Medhātithi’s)
use of ‘some think’, ‘some explain’ is such, as in this passage, to
suggest that they are occasionally used hypothetically, a possible view
being set up and overthrown rather than actual statement that other
commentators explain the passage so and so; a modification of meaning
that would somewhat affect the amount of criticism devoted to the text
before Medhātithi’s day.”</p>
<p>Though this may be true, to a certain extent, regarding the references
in the form of ‘<em>kechit</em>’, it cannot be so regarding those in the form
‘<em>anye tu</em>’ or ‘<em>anyevya cakṣate</em>’ and such other moṛe definite
references to <em>other explanations</em>.</p>
<p>This verse has been quoted by Raghunandana in his <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (Jyotiṣ,
p. 648)—dealing with the <em>Jātakarma</em> Sacrament;—also in the
<em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 353).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in the <em>Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi</em> (p. 433) as laying
down the time for the ‘Birth-sacrament’;—in the <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p.
23) which adds the following notes—‘<em>Vardhana</em>’ is <em>cutting</em>; some
people have held that no significance attaches to the masculine gender
of ‘<em>puruṣaḥ</em>’; but Medhātithi has held that it is meant to be
significant, there being no such rite in the case of the child without
gender-signs, and for the woman it is performed without <em>mantras</em> in
accordance with another text;—it is quoted in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 31 <em>b</em>);—in <em>Hemādri</em> (<em>Pariśeṣa</em>, p. 583),
where‘<em>Vardhana</em>’ is explained as <em>cutting</em>; and again on p. 736, where
the same is repeated;—in the same work (Śrāddha, p. 326);—in
<em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 831) to the effect that the rite is to be
performed before the cutting of the umbilical cord;—and in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 49) to the same effect; it reads
‘<em>puruṣam</em>’ for ‘<em>puruṣaḥ</em>’</p>
<p><em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 192) quotes it as laying down the exact
time for the performance of the sacrament, in the first half,—and the
form of the sacrament in the second half. It quotes it again (p. 403) in
support of the view that Manu having prescribed the sacraments of
<em>Nāmakaraṇa</em>, <em>Niṣkramaṇa</em>, <em>Annaprāśana</em>, <em>Chuḍā, Upanayaṇa</em> and
<em>Keśānta</em>, for the <em>male</em> child,—adds a verse (2. 66) to the effect that
‘all this is to be done for the <em>female</em> child &amp;c. &amp;c.,—which makes it
clear that the <em>Upanayaṇa rite</em> should be performed for the female child
also; and the statement (in 2-67) that for women the ‘marriage’
constitutes the ‘upanayaṇa’ only provides a possible <em>substitute</em> for
<em>Upanayaṇa</em> in the case of females.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 171) as laying down the
<em>Jātakarma</em>, and explains ‘<em>vardhana</em>’ <em>as</em> ‘<em>cutting</em>.’</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>One should perform the ‘naming,’ ‘<em>Nāmadheya</em>,’ of the child on the
tenth or the twelfth day.</p>
<p>No significance is meant to be attached to the sense of the causative
affix in ‘<em>Kārayet</em>,’ should <em>have</em> <em>it done</em>.’ For the <em>Gṛhyasūtra</em>
simply says—‘On the tenth day the father should take up the child and
<em>perform</em> his naming’ (without the causal form).</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>Nāmadheya</em>’ means simply ‘<em>nāma</em>,’ ‘name’; and it is that
word by which a person is called during life.</p>
<p>In as much as the section has started with the mentiou of the
‘<em>Jātakarma</em>,’ as to be done ‘before the cutting of the umbilical cord,’
it follows that the ‘<em>tenth</em>’ and ‘<em>twelfth</em>’ (of the Text) refer to the
day as counted from the day of birth; and they do not refer to the
<em>lunar dates</em>.</p>
<p>On this point some people have held that the mention of the ‘tenth day’
is only meant to indicate the ‘passing of the days of impurity’; the
past-participle epithet ‘<em>atītāyām</em>,’ ‘having passed,’ being understood.
So that the meaning is that, ‘for the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> the Naming should be
done after the lapse of the tenth day, for the <em>Kṣatriya</em> after the
lapse of the twelfth day, and for the <em>Vaiśya</em> after the lapse of the
fifteenth day.’</p>
<p>This explanation, however, is not right. For there being no ground for
taking the words in the indirect figurative sense suggested, the
ceremony could very well be performed during the period of impurity,
just like the ‘Birth-rite.’ If the feeding of the Brāhmaṇas were
enjoined (as a necessary accompaniment of the Ṛte), then there might be
some justification for the suggested figurative interpretation.</p>
<p>If the ‘tenth’ or the ‘twelfth’ day happen to fulfil the conditions
mentioned in the second line of the verse, then the ceremony should be
done on those days. Otherwise it should be performed on some other
<em>auspicious lunar date</em>.</p>
<p>The ‘auspicious lunar dates’ are the, the <em>fifth</em> (day of the lunar
month), and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Puṇya</em>,’ ‘<em>auspicious</em>,’ means <em>commended</em>. The <em>ninth, fourteenth</em>
and such other days (of the lunar month),—which are commonly called
‘<em>Riktā</em>,’—are ‘not commended,’ ‘inauspicious.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Muhūrta</em>,’ ‘<em>moment</em>,’ stands for what is called ‘<em>lagna</em>’ (the point
of time indicated by the ‘contact with the Horizon,’ <em>i.e</em>., the
‘rising,’ of a particular Zodiacal Sign), Aquarius, and the rest. ‘At a
moment that is <em>auspicious</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., which is not possessed by any evil
planet, which is looked upon by Jupiter and Venus. Such ‘auspiciousness’
of the moment can be ascertained with the help of the science of
Astrology.</p>
<p>‘<em>Under a propitious lunar asterism</em>,’—the ‘are those beginning with
<em>Śraviṣṭhā</em>; and that day on which these happen to be ‘propitious.’ The
‘propitiousness’ of the Lunar Asterism consists in its being free from
the contact of ‘malignant’ and ‘evil’ planets, as also from the
condition of ‘<em>Vyatīpāta</em>’ (a malignant aspect of the Sun and the Moon).</p>
<p>The particle ‘<em>Vā</em>’ in the Text has a collective sense (meaning ‘and’);
hence the meaning is that ‘the ceremony should he performed on an
auspicious day, <em>and</em> at an auspicious moment, <em>and</em> under a faultless
lunar asterism.’ The due combination of all these conditions can be
ascertained with the help of the Science of Astrology.</p>
<p>The final upshot of the whole comes to this:—The ceremony should never
be performed before the tenth or twelfth day,—and after these days it
may be performed only at the auspicious moment on that day which is
found to be under a propitious lunar asterism.’—(30)</p>

<p>‘<em>Daśamyām dvādaśyām</em>’—‘The tenth of twelfth day of the

impurity’—which is accepted by Kullūka.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 233) where it
notes the latter explanation and says that it has been rejected by
Medhātithi and Aparārka. It is curious that having the work of
Medhātithi before him, the author of Vīramitrodaya did not note his
explanation that the ceremony is to be performed on the 10th or 12th day
(<em>tithi</em>) of the month.</p>
<p>The verse is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 855) also, where however no
explanation is given—and in <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 371), where it is added
that what is meant is that the naming of the Brāhmaṇa should be done <em>on
the expiry of the tenth day</em>, of the Kṣatriya <em>on the expiry of the
twelfth day</em>, of the Vaiśya <em>on the expiry of the sixteenth day</em> and of
the Shudra <em>on the expiry of the twenty-first day</em>;—and the second half
of the verse lays down substitutes.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 24), which adds that
‘<em>daśamyām</em>’ has been taken as ‘<em>daśamyām añtāyam</em>’, ‘after the lapse of

‘<em>kārayet</em>’;—in <em>Saṃskāṛaratnamālā</em> (p. 850), which adds that the causal
affix in ‘<em>kārayet</em>’ has the reflexive sense;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em>

explains meaning as ‘on the tenth day from the day of the birth, the
<em>father</em> should do the naming’, it being the father’s business to do
this.</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The Author now proceeds to determine the form of the name to be given to
the child.</p>
<p>‘<em>Maṅgalyam</em>,’ ‘<em>auspicious</em>,’ means ‘<em>maṅgalāya hitam</em>,’ or ‘<em>maṅgalāya
sādhu</em>,’ ‘conducive to welfare.’ The ‘welfare’ meant here is that which
consists in the fulfilment of something desirable, in the shape of
longevity, wealth and such other things as lead to physical and mental
pleasure. And a term can be said to be ‘conducive,’—‘<em>hita</em>’ or
‘<em>sādhu</em>,’—to this welfare, only when it connotes it; and it is in this
sense that we have the Nominal Affix (‘<em>yat</em>,’ in ‘<em>maṅgalyam</em>’).
Further, by being ‘conducive’ it is not meant that it should always
express the actual fulfilment of a desirable thing; but that it may also
express the desirable thing itself.</p>
<p>This connotation of the desirable thing may be either (a) by means of
compounds, such as ‘<em>āyuḥsiddhi</em>’ (accomplishment, of longevity),
‘<em>dhanasiddhi</em>’ (acquisition of wealth), ‘<em>putralāhha</em>’ (obtaining of a
son), and so forth,—or (<em>b</em>) by a nominal affix connoting
‘conduciveness’ ‘effectiveness,’ or ‘purpose.’ But the <em>Gṛhyasūtra</em> has
prohibited the use of a name ending in a Nominal affix—‘One should fix a
name ending with a Verbal, not one with a nominal affix’—says Pāraskara.
And as for compounds also, there is a combination of the denotations of
two words; so that there is a chance of the name consisting of many
letters; the lext is going to lay down certain appendages to the actual
names, such as ‘the name of Brāhmaṇa should end in <em>Śarman</em>, and so
forth’ (Manu, 2.32); so that if the name consists of three or four
letters, along with the appendage ‘<em>śarman</em>,’ it would oome to consist
of five or six letters; and this would go against the rule that ‘the
name should consist of two or four letters.’ (Baudhāyana and Āpastamba).
From all this it follows that such words should he employed as names as
are connotative of things that are desired by most people,—<em>e.g</em>., son,
cattle, landed property, daughter, wealth and so forth; and these should
end with the term ‘**śarm<em>an</em>.’ Thus it is that such names become
possible as ‘<em>Go-<strong>śarm</strong>an</em>.’ ‘<em>Dhana-<strong>śarm</strong>an</em>,’
‘<em>Hiraṇya-<strong>śarm</strong>an</em>,’ ‘<em>Kalyāṇa-<strong>śarm</strong>an</em>,’ ‘<em>Maṅgala-<strong>śarm</strong>an</em>,’
and so on.</p>
<p>Or, the term ‘<em>maṅgala</em>’ may be taken as standing for ‘<em>Dharma</em>,’
‘<em>Merit</em>’; and ‘<em>maṅgalya</em>’ in that case would mean <em>that which is
conducive to merit</em> (meritorious).</p>
<p>“What is it that is <em>conducive to merit?</em>”</p>
<p>All those words that constitute the names of Deities; <em>e.g., ‘Indra</em>,’
‘<em>Agni</em>,’ ‘<em>Vāyū</em>’; also the names of sages—<em>e.g</em>., ‘<em>Vasiṣṭha</em>,’
‘<em>Viśvāmiṭra</em>,’ ‘<em>Medhātithi</em>’; these latter also are ‘conducive to
merit’; as is clearly indicated by such directions as—(a) ‘one should
make offerings to the sages,’ (<em>b</em>) ‘one should meditate upon the men of
pious deeds,’ ‘one who desires prosperity should, on rising in the
morning, repeat the names of Deities, sages and of the Brāhmaṇas of
pious deeds.’</p>
<p>The epithet ‘<em>mangalya</em>,’ ‘<em>auspicious</em>’ (meritorious) serves to
preclude all ‘inauspicious’ names, such as ‘<em>Yama</em>,’ ‘<em>Mṛtyu</em>’ and the
like; and also those that are meaningless—such, as ‘<em>Ḍittha</em>’ and the
like.</p>
<p>‘<em>That of the Kṣatriya connected with power</em>,’—<em>i.e., expressive of
power</em>. The ‘<em>anvaya</em>’ (expressed by ‘<em>anvita</em>’ in the compound
‘<em>balānvita</em>’ means <em>connection</em>; and the only connection that a word
can have with a thing is the relation, of being connotative of
it.—‘<em>Power</em>’ is <em>strength</em>; and the word, that connotes this should be
used as the name for the <em>Kṣatriya,e.g</em>., ‘<em>Śatruntapa</em>,’
‘<em>Duryodhana</em>,’ ‘<em>Prajāpāla</em>.’ The several kinds of names have been
mentioned (in the text), as indicative of the several castes.</p>
<p>Similarly, ‘<em>that of the Vaiśya Associated with wealth</em>.’ It is not
meant that only synonyms of ‘<em>dhana</em>’ should be used,—such as ‘<em>Dhana</em>’
‘<em>Vitta</em>,’ ‘<em>Svāpateya</em>,’—but that any word that may be in any way
connotative of wealth should be used. Or, what is meant is that either
such words as ‘<em>dhana</em>’ (‘wealth’) and the like should be used, or such
as signify connection with wealth; such as ‘<em>Dhanakarman</em>,’
‘<em>Mahādhana</em>,’ ‘<em>Goman</em>,’ ‘<em>Dhānyag?aha</em>.’</p>
<p>Throughout this verse, such is the meaning—of the term ‘connected with
power’ and ‘associated with wealth.’ If this were not what is meant, the
text would have said simply ‘the <em>names of power</em> should be used.’ And
in that case, since the words actually denotative of <em>power</em> would be
very few in number, while the number of individuals to be named would be
endless,—all usage (based oh names) would come to an end.</p>
<p>‘<em>That of the Śūdra contemptible</em>,’—such as ‘<em>Kṛpaṇaka</em>,’ ‘<em>Dīna</em>,’
‘<em>Śavaraka</em>,’ and so forth.—(31)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Gadādharapaddhati</em> (Kālasāra, p. 217);—in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 53) to the effect that the names of the
four castes should consist of words expressive respectively, of welfare,
strength, wealth and deprecation;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Saṃskāra p.
346);—and in <em>Saṃskāra-mayūkha</em> (p. 25).</p>
<p>Burnell—‘This is now obsolete. The names of the different castes are now
usually epithets or titles of some favourite deity. The caste is known
only by the suffixed title.’</p>
<p>This verse has been quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskā ra, p. 242), where
we have the following explanations: ‘<em>maṅgalyam</em>’ means <em>expressive</em> of
<em>auspiciousness</em>; e.g., the name ‘<em>Lakṣmīdhara</em>’;—‘<em>Balānvitam</em>’ means
<em>expressive of bravery</em>, e.g., the name
‘<em>Yudhiṣṭhira</em>;’—‘<em>dhanasamyuktam</em>’, means <em>containing terms expressive
of wealth</em>; e.g., the name ‘<em>Mahādhana</em>’;—‘<em>jugupsitam</em>’ means
<em>containing a term denoting depreciation</em>; e.g., the name ‘<em>Naradāsa</em>’.</p>
<p><em>Madanapārijāta</em> also quotes this verse (on p. 357), where it is
explained to mean that ‘the names should be expressive of auspiciousness
and the rest’</p>
<p><em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 441) quotes it as also the four typical
names as—‘<em>Śrī Śarmā</em>’ ‘<em>Vikramapālo</em>’, <em>Māṇikyaśreṣṭhi and
Hīnadāsa</em>;—it is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 27) as laying down rules
regarding the first part of the name.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>
<p><em>Śaṅkha</em> (Smṛti, 2.3).—‘The name of all castes should consist of an even
number of letters; an auspicious one for the Brāhmaṇa, one endowed with
strength for the Kṣatriya.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (Smṛti, 1.27.6-9).—‘The Brāhmaṇa’s name should be expressive of
auspiciousness—the Kṣatriya’s expressive of strength,—the Vaiśya’s
expressive of wealth,—the Śūdra’s expressive of depreciation.’</p>
<p><em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Śaṃskāra, p. 237).—Names are of four kinds;</p>
<ol>
<li>connected with family-deity,</li>
<li>connected with month,</li>
<li>connected with asterism,</li>
<li>and temporal.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<em>a</em>) Says Śaṅkha.—‘The father should fix a name connected with the
family-deity,’ <em>i.e</em>., a name consisting of words expressive of the
Deity.</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) Gārgya.—‘The father should impart to the hoy the name of the month
and the name of the preceptor. The months have been declared to have the
following names:—</p>
<ol>
<li>Mārgaśīrṣa—Kṛṣṇa,</li>
<li>Pauṣa—Ananta,</li>
<li>Māgha—Achyuta,</li>
<li>Phālguna—Chakrī,</li>
<li>Caitra—Vaikuṇṭha,</li>
<li>Vaiśākha,—Janārdana,</li>
<li>Jyaiṣṭha,—Upendra,</li>
<li>Āṣāḍha—Yajñapuruṣa.</li>
<li>Śrāvaṇa—Vāsudeva.</li>
<li>Bhādra—Hari,</li>
<li>Āśvina—Yogīśa,</li>
<li>Kārttika—Puṇḍarīkākṣa.’</li>
</ol>
<p>(<em>c</em>) Śaṅkha-Likhita.—‘Either the father or some other senior member of
the family should fix a name connected with the asterism.’ This name has
been held to be the one to be used when the person bearing the name
accosts a superior.</p>
<p>Says Baudhāyana—‘This name in accordance with the asterism is the secret
one, which is known only to the father and the mother and which the boy
is to use in accosting.’</p>
<p>Also Āśvalāyana—‘The accosting name should be known only to the father
and the mother; as it is under this name that the boy is initiated.’</p>
<p>Also Śaunaka, ‘That name under which he is to be initiated, and by which
he will do the accosting of the teacher,—should also be fixed at the
time of the naming ceremony. This accostive name should be pronounced by
the father very silently, so that others may not know it. This
initiative name the parents should bear in mind.’</p>
<p>Like the names attached to the months the names attached to the
asterisms are as follows:—</p>
<ol>
<li>Agni (Kṛttikā),</li>
<li>Prajāpati (Rohiṇī),</li>
<li>Soma (Mṛgaśiras),</li>
<li>Rudra (Ārdrā),</li>
<li>Diti (Punarvasū),</li>
<li>Bṛhaspati (Puṣvā),</li>
<li>Sarpa (Aśleṣā),</li>
<li>Pitṛ (Maghā),</li>
<li>Bhaga (Purvaphalgunī),</li>
<li>Aryamā (Uttaraphalgunī),</li>
<li>Savitṛ (Hastā),</li>
<li>Tvaṣtṛ (Chitrā),</li>
<li>Āyuṣ (Svātī),</li>
<li>Indra-Agni (Viśākhā),</li>
<li>Mitra (Anurādhā),</li>
<li>Indra (Jyeṣṭhā),</li>
<li>Nirṛti (Mūlā),</li>
<li>Apas (Pūrvāṣāḍhā),</li>
<li>Viśvedevas (Uttarāṣāḍhā),</li>
<li>Viṣṇu (Śravaṇā),</li>
<li>Vasu (Dhaniṣṭhā),</li>
<li>Varuṇa (Śatabhiṣa),</li>
<li>Ajaikapāt (Pūrvabhādra),</li>
<li>Ahirbudhnya (Uttarabhādra),</li>
<li>Pūṣan (Revatī),</li>
<li>Aśvins (Aśvinī),</li>
<li>Yama (Bharaṇī).</li>
</ol>
<p>But according to Baudhāyana, the “name connected with the asterism” is
in accordance with the names of the asterisms themselves—such as
‘Rohiṇī,’ ‘Bharaṇī,’ and the rest; and not in accordance with the name
of the deity attached to each asterism. According to the astrologers
however each asterism has four letters assigned to it (such as
<em>chū-che-cho-la</em>, assigned to Aśvinī, and so forth, and “the name
connected with the asterism of Aśvinī,” would be the name whose first
letter consists of one of these four letters).</p>
<p>(<em>d</em>) The ‘temporal name’ has been described by Bṛhaspati as ‘conducive
to all kinds of business.’ It is this name that has been laid down by
Āśvalāyana as having for its first letter one of the ghoṣa-letters, in
its middle one of the <em>antastha</em> letters; ending with the <em>visarga</em>,
containing either two or four vowels; and in male names the number of
letters should always be even.</p>
<p>But Baijavāpa—‘The father fixes the name, which consists of either two
or three or four letters, or of unlimited number of letters.’</p>
<p>Vaśiṣṭha—‘The name should consist of either two or four vowels, but
those ending in <em>l</em> or <em>r</em> should be avoided.’</p>
<p>The Mahābhāṣya—‘The first letter of the name should be <em>ghoṣa-vat</em>, the
middle one of the <em>antastha</em> letters, it should not be similar to the
names of the ancestors, or of the enemy; it should be one formed with a
verbal affix, not with a nominal affix.’</p>
<p>Āśvalāyana—‘That name is best which consists of either four or two
letters, which is in consonance with that of the <em>grandfather</em>’ (this
last includes also the <em>gods</em>).</p>
<p>Kapila-Saṃhitā—‘On the eleventh day, in due form, the name should be
given, which is in consonance with the family-custom, and resembles the
name of the gods or of the parents.’</p>
<p><em>Baijavāpa</em> (Aparārka, p. 27).—‘The father gives a name either of one
letter or two letters or three letters or four letters, or of letters
without limit; it should be one formed with a verbal, never with a
nominal, affix.’</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>[What appears to be the meaning is that] the actual term (‘<em>śarman</em>,’
etc.) should form part of the name,—and that the two terms (mentioned in
the preceding and the present verse) should appear in the order stated,
the ‘auspicious’ term coming at the beginning and the term ‘<em>śarman</em>’ at
the end (of the name),—as illustrated above (‘<em>Go-śarman</em>,’
‘<em>Dhana-śarman</em>’ and so forth).</p>
<p>But this would not be possible in regard to the names of the <em>Kṣatriya</em>
and the rest; because the term ‘<em>rakṣā</em>.’ (‘security,’ which is
mentioned in connection with the <em>Kṣatriya</em>) is of the feminine gender,
and as such could not be co-ordinated with the names of males. Hence in
view of conformity, and in view also of actual practice, and also in
view of the two verses being syntactically distinct, we should take them
as complementary to each other; the sense being that the ‘auspicious
name’ (mentioned in the preceding verse) should he ‘expressive of
<em>śarman</em>, Peace’—this term standing for <em>refuge, shelter, happiness</em>. It
is only if we take the term ‘<em>śarman</em>’ of the text as standing for what
is developed by it, that we have the possibility of names ending in
‘<em>svāmū</em>,’ ‘<em>datta</em>,’ ‘<em>bhūti</em>,’ and the rest; the name ‘<em>Indrasvāmī</em>’
meaning ‘he who has Indra for his shelter’; ‘<em>Indra-datta</em>’ also
signifies the fact of Indra being the <em>shelter</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly with all the rest (the names of the <em>Kṣatriya</em>, etc.)</p>
<p>“What does this argument mean—that, in view of the two verses being
syntactically distinct, we should take them as complementary to each
other? Por the same reason, why are not the two sentences ‘one should
sacrifice with <em>Vrīhi</em>’ and ‘one should sacrifice with <em>Yava</em>’ taken as
complementary (and not as optional alternatives, as they have been
taken)?”</p>
<p>What we have said is only what is indicated (by the words of the Text).
The Text being the work of a human writer, if he had intended the
statements to be optional alternatives, he should, for the sake of
brevity, have said ‘the name should be <em>either auspicious or expressive
of peace</em>’; when we have two distinct syntactical constructions, there
are two verbs, and this becomes too prolix (and the prolixity cannot be
justified except by taking the two as complementary). [All this reason
ng, based upon <em>intention</em> and <em>propriety of speech</em>, cannot apply to
the case of Vedic sentences, where there is no author.]</p>
<p>‘<em>Rakṣā</em>,’ is ‘protection,’ ‘preservation.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Puṣṭi</em>’ is ‘prosperity’ as well as ‘security.’ Such names as
‘<em>Govṛddha</em>’ ‘<em>Dhanagupta</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Preṣya</em>’ is ‘submissive’; such names as ‘<em>Brāhmaṇa-dāsa</em>,’ and
‘<em>Devadāsa</em>,’ which means (respectively) ‘submissive to, dependent upon,
the Brāhmaṇa’ and ‘submissive to and dependent upon a deity.’—(32)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 243) also; and in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra. p. 55) as laying down the subsidiary titles
of the four caste-names;—also in <em>Vidhānapārijāta</em> (p. 309);—and in
<em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 178).</p>
<p><em>Parāśaramādḥava</em> (Ācāra, p. 441) quoting the verse explains it to mean
that ‘<em>śarman</em>’ must be the suffixed word to the Brāhmaṇa’s name.</p>
<p>Nārayaṇa and Rāghavānanda opine that the name of the Brāhmaṇa must
always contain the word ‘śarman’ itself. But Medhātithi and several
others hold that the name should connote what is connoted by the term
‘<em>śarman</em>.’</p>
<p>The present day practice, however, follows the former
explanation—‘<em>śarman</em>’.being regarded now as the suffixed title to every
Brāhmaṇa’s name.</p>

<p><em>Vyāsa-Smṛti</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 213).—‘<em>Śarma</em> is the name

Kṣatriya, <em>Gupta</em> and <em>Datta</em> for the Vaiśya and <em>Dāsa</em> for the Śūdra.</p>
<p>These titles have been thus explained by Āśvalāyanāchārya:—‘The name of
the Brāhmaṇa should end with <em>Śarma</em> because he imparts <em>Śarma</em>
(happiness) to the world through his religious character, calmness and
self-control; that of the Kṣatriya should end with <em>Varmā</em>, because like
the <em>Varma</em> (armour), he protects the world from the three kinds of
pain; that of the Vaiśya should end with <em>Gupta</em>, because he fosters
(<em>gopāyati</em>) the people by giving them money at certain times; that of
the Śūdra should end with <em>Dāsa</em>, because he keeps the twice-born people
satisfied by constant service.’</p>

<p>Inasmuch as significance has been attached to the mention of the ‘male’
child (in verse 29), what has been said in the preceding verses is not
applicable to women; and the present verse is going to lay down rules
regarding the names of women.</p>
<p>‘<em>Easily pronouncible</em>’;—that which can be easily pronounced; the name
of women should be such as can be uttered, with ease, even by women and
children. It is mostly women and children that have got to deal with
women; and the woman’s organ of speech being not very efficient, she
cannot pronounce each and every Sanskrit word; hence the Text lays
stress upon this pronouncibility in the case of feminine names. This
however docs not mean that the masculine names may be unpronouncible. As
examples of ‘pronouncible’ names wo have, ‘<em>Maṅgala-devī</em>,’
‘<em>Chārudati</em>,’ ‘<em>Suvadanā</em>,’ etc., and as counter-examples (<em>i.e</em>., of
<em>unpronouncible</em> names), ‘<em>Śarmiṣṭhā</em>,’ ‘<em>Suśliṣṭāṅgī</em>,’ and the like.</p>
<p>‘<em>Not harsh</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., not denoting any thing harsh; names denoting
harsh things are such as ‘<em>Ḍākinī</em>’ (Sorceress), ‘<em>Paruṣā</em>’ (Rough) and
so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Of plain meaning</em>,’—whose moaning does not need to be explained before
it is comprehended; which, as soon as it is heard, couveys its meaning
to the learned and the unlearned alike. As examples of names with
meanings not plain, we have, (<em>a</em>) ‘<em>Kāmaniḍhā</em>’ and (<em>b</em>)
‘<em>Kāriṣagandhī</em>’; the meaning of these terms is not comprehended until
the following explanations have been provided:—(<em>a</em>) ‘who is, as if it
were, the <em>very</em> receptacle of love, she in whom all love is contained,’
and (<em>b</em>) ‘<em>Kārīṣagandhī</em>’ is the ‘daughter of Kariṣagandhi.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Heart-captivating</em>,’—that which pleases the mind; <em>e.g</em>., ‘<em>Śreyasī</em>’;
while of the contrary kind we have the name ‘<em>Kālākṣī</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Auspicious</em>,’—such as ‘<em>Śarmavatī</em>’; of the contrary kind is the name
‘<em>Abhāgā</em>,’ ‘M <em>andabhāgā</em>.’ ‘<em>Ending in a long vowel</em>,’—that which has
a long vowel at the end. Contrary to this is the name ‘<em>Śarat</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Āśīrvāda</em>’ is <em>that which denotes benediction</em>; ‘<em>abhidhāna</em>’ is
<em>term</em>; and when the two are compounded in tho <em>dhāraya</em> form, we get
the meaning ‘<em>benedictory term</em>’; and the name that contains such a term
is called ‘<em>āśīrvādābhidhānavat</em>,’ ‘<em>containing a benedictory term</em>.’
Examples of such names—‘<em>Saputrā</em>,’ ‘<em>Bahuputrā</em>,’ ‘<em>Kulavāhikā</em>’; these
are benedictory names; of the contrary kind are such names as,
‘<em>Apraśastā</em>,’ ‘<em>Alakṣaṇā</em>.’</p>
<p>“What is the difference between ‘auspicious’ and ‘benedictory’?”</p>
<p>None whatsoever. The second epithet has been added only for the purpose
of filling up the metre.—(33)</p>

‘<em>Kulaghnī</em>’ (harsh)—‘<em>Indirā</em>’ (not of plain meaning)—‘<em>Kamahīyā</em>’
(heart-captivating)—‘<em>Subhadrā</em>’ (auspicious)—and ‘<em>Saubhāgyavatī</em>’

<p>‘<em>In the fourth month</em>’—from birth—‘<em>should be performed the ceremony of
the child’s egress</em>’—being taken out of the room and shown the sun. This
implies that for three months the child should he kept in the lying-in
room itself.</p>
<p>The common name ‘<em>child</em>’ is used, with a view to include the <em>śūdra</em>
also.</p>
<p>Similarly ‘<em>in the sixth month</em>,’ the ceremony of First Feeding on
grains. For five months the child should he kept purely on milk.</p>
<p>‘<em>Or, whatever might be regarded as auspicious</em>’—conducive to
welfare—‘<em>in the family</em>’ of the child; such well-known rites, for
instance, as making offerings to <em>Pūṭanā</em>, to <em>Śakunika</em>, to certain
trees, etc., etc. This may he done at specified times.</p>
<p>This last clause is meant to apply to all ceremonies; so that the
<em>naming</em> also may he done according to family custom, even though it be
not in strict conformity with the rules laid down above. Hence with
different families, such names become possible as—‘<em>Indrasvāmī</em>,’
‘<em>Indraśarman</em>’ ‘<em>Indrabhūti</em>,’ ‘<em>Indrarāta</em>,’ <em>Indraviṣṇu</em>,’
‘<em>Indradeva</em>,’ ‘<em>Indrajyotiṣ</em>,’ ‘<em>Indrayaśaṣ</em>,’ and so forth.—(34)</p>

<p>‘<em>Cūḍā</em>’ is the tuft of hair on the crown of the bead’; and the ceremony
for the purpose of this is called ‘**Cū<em>ḍākarman</em>,’ ‘<em>Tonsure</em>’; this
name ‘Tonsure’ is given to that ceremony which consists in the cutting
of the hair in such a manner as to leave well-arranged tufts of hair on
certain parts of the head.</p>
<p>This may be done ‘<em>in the first year or the third</em>’;—this option being
due to considerations of the good and evil aspects of planets.</p>
<p>‘<em>In view of the injunctions of the Veda</em>’:—this is merely explanatory:
the fact of the entire contents of the work being based upon the Veda
having been already stated before. Or, the term may he taken here as not
necessarily standing for the injunctive texts, but including the Mantras
also; and as a matter of fact, we have the <em>mantra</em>, ‘<em>yatkṣureṇa
mārjayet, etc</em>.,’ (<em>Pāraskara-gṛhyasūtra</em>, 2.1.1), which is indicative
of the Tonsure-ceremony, in the same manner as the <em>Mantra</em> ‘<em>yāñjanā
pratinandanti, etc</em>.,’ (<em>Pāraskara</em>,—3.2.2) indicates the
<em>Aṣṭakā-rites</em>. So that what the phrase means is that the ceremony
should be performed with <em>mantras</em>. As to the particular details
(regarding the <em>mantras</em>, etc.), these are learnt from the <em>Gṛyhasūtra</em>.</p>
<p>From this it follows that this sacrament is not to he done for the
<em>Śūdra</em>; which is also clear from the mention of the ‘<em>twice-born</em>.’ As
for the <em>shaving of hair</em> without any restriction as to time, this is
done for special purposes, and may he done for the Śūdra also: this is
not interdicted.—(35)</p>

<p>‘<em>Dharmataḥ</em>’—‘according to Law’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘for the sake
of spiritual merit’ (Kullūka).</p>
<p>This verse has been quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 605) for
the purpose of showing that even a boy who has not cut his teeth can be
‘one who has had Ids Tonsure performed.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛti-tattva</em> (p. 653)—which points out that the time
most suited for the ceremony is the <em>third</em>, not the <em>first</em> year and it
bases this on the distinct declaration by Śaṅkha that—‘for the rite of
Tonsure, the third year is what has been accepted by all the
Gṛhyasūtras.’ It also quotes it on p. 922, with a view to show that the
time for the ceremony is not fixed, there being an option as to its
being done in the first, third, or even the fifth year.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 296), where it is
explained that the presence of the particle ‘vā,’ ‘or’, implies that the
rite may be performed in the <em>second</em> year also; this latter is also
sanctioned by a text from Yama.</p>
<p><em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 34) also quotes it without adding any explanatory
notes.—It is quoted in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 58);—in <em>Hemādri</em>
(Pariśeṣa, p. 742);—in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (pp. 29 and 128), which quotes
Medhātithi to the effect that the term ‘<em>dvijātīnām</em>’ indicates that
this rite is not to be performed for the Shudra.;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 36c); and in <em>Gadādharapaddhati</em> (Kālasāra, p. 219).</p>
<p>Medhātithi has described this ceremony as that ‘which consists in the
cutting of the hair in such a manner as to leave well-arranged tufts of
hair on certain parts of the head.’</p>
<p>Further details have heen supplied in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 361), which
quotes <em>Lokākṣi</em> (called Laugākṣi in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, p. 653) describing
the ‘**Cū<em>ḍā</em>’as ‘a line of hair, towards the right among the
<em>Vaśiṣṭhas</em>, on both sides among the <em>Airis</em> and <em>Kāśyapas</em>, and in five
places among the <em>Āṅgirasas</em>; some people keep a single line; others
only the top-tuft, shaped like the leaf of the banyan tree—and adds that
the exact form is to be determined by the <em>Gṛhyasūtra, of the man
concerned</em>.</p>

conception or from Birth,—during the fifth or the seventh year should be
performed for the male as well as the female child.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 996).—‘The learned recommend the

tenth or the eleventh year from Birth.—The Tonsure of children should he
performed either, before the end of the first year, or in the third or
fifth year, or according to the family-custom.’</p>
<p><em>Atri</em> (Do., p. 298).—‘Tonsure during the third year is conducive to the
fulfilment of all desires; that during the first year is conducive to
longevity and Brāhmic glory; that during the fifth year leads to the
acquisition of cattle; during the even years, it is to be deprecated.’</p>

year.’</p>
<p><em>Laugākṣi</em> (Do., p. 299).—‘Tonsure should be performed during the third
year, after the lapse of its third part.’</p>
<p>[The upshot of the whole is that Tonsure may he performed during any of

<p>Counting from the year that one spends in the mother’s womb, when the
child reaches the eighth year;—the term ‘<em>garbha</em>’ stands for the <em>year</em>
spent in the womb; this indication being due to the presence of the term
‘year,’ ‘<em>abda</em>’; certainly the ‘year’ could never be the ‘eighth’ from
‘<em>garbha</em>,’ if this latter were taken in its direct sense;—in this year
<em>one should perform the Initiation of the Brāhmaṇa</em>.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>aupanāyanam</em>’ stands for ‘<em>upamyanam</em>,’ the ‘<em>aṇ</em>’ affix
having the reflexive sense; and the lengthening of the vowel in the
latter term (‘<em>nayanam</em>’) being in accordance with (<em>Pāṇini</em> 6.3.198);
or the lengthening of the vowels of both terms (‘<em>upa</em>’ and ‘<em>nayanam</em>’)
may be regarded as a Vedic anomaly.</p>
<p>‘<em>Upanayana</em>,’ ‘Initiation,’ is the name of a sacrament described in the
<em>Gṛhyasūtras</em> and well-known to Vedic scholars, its other name is
‘<em>Mauñjī-bandha</em>,’ ‘<em>Girdle-Investiture</em>.’ That ceremony in which the
child is taken over to—made over to—(<em>upanīyate</em>)—the teacher, for the
purposes of teaching—and not for any such other purpose as the building
of a Avail, or the making of a mat—is what is called ‘<em>Upanayana</em>.’ It
is the name of a particular sacramental rite.</p>
<p>‘<em>Of the King in the eleventh year from conception</em>’;—for the
<em>Kṣatṭriya</em> the ceremony should be performed in the eleventh year ‘<em>from
conception</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., ‘<em>beginning</em> <em>from</em> conception,’ or ‘<em>after</em>
conception.’</p>
<p>The term ‘king’ ‘<em>rājan</em>’ (in ‘<em>rājñaḥ</em>’) should he taken as standing
for the Kṣatriya caste; and does not necessarily mean one who is a duly
anointed king; firstly because such is the sense in which the word is
generally used in books; secondly because in the present context it
occurs along with the terms ‘<em>Brāhmaṇa</em>’ and the rest (which are all
denotative of <em>castes</em>); and thirdly because we find the term
‘<em>Kṣatriya</em>’ used in the rules that follow regarding the details of the
ceremony; <em>e.g</em>., it is raid that ‘the girdle of the Kṣatriya should
consist of the bow-string’ (below, Verse 12). It is true that the term
‘king’ is sometimes used in the sense of the ‘rulers’ of ‘countries,’
and as such applied to <em>Vaiśyas</em> and other castes also; but such usage
is purely figurative and indirect. And the figurative meaning of a word
can be accepted only when the original direct meaning is found
inapplicable. That the term ‘king’ in the text stands for the <em>Kṣatriya</em>
is shown by the following words of the author of the <em>Gṛhya-sutra</em>—‘One
should initiate the Brāhmaṇa in the eighth year, the <em>Kṣatriya</em> in the
eleventh and the Vaiśya in the twefth.’ It is on this understanding that
the revered Pāṇini derives the word ‘<em>rājya</em>’ (‘Kingship’) from the word
‘<em>rājan</em>’ (King), explaining it as ‘the function the King,’ and hence
used in the ordinary sense of ‘lord of country’ [ <em>i.e</em>., the ‘function
of ruling a country’ really belongs to the Kṣatriya caste, and when
persons of other castes arc called ‘King’ their title is based upon
their doing ‘the work of the King’].</p>

from conception</em>.—(86)</p>

<p>What belongs to the father is here attributed to the child; the
desire—‘May my sou attain Brahmic glory!’—resides in the father; and
this desire being attributed to the child, the latter is spoken of as
‘desirous of Brahmic glory.’ The child itself is too youug to have the
said desire.</p>
<p>“In that case the action done by one person would have its result
accruing to a totally different person; and this would involve the
absurdity of a man acquiring what he has not earned. And the assertion
that the result accrues to the child without his desiring it is one that
is contrary to all reason and scriptural authority.”</p>
<p>There is no force in the objection. The case in question is analogous to
that of the <em>Śyena</em> sacrifice: the <em>Śyena</em> is performed by a man seekiug
to encompass death, and this death falls upon the person against whom
the performance is aimed (and not on the performer himself). It might be
argued that—“in this case the result actually accrues to the person
seekiug for it; it is the sacrificer who desires the death of his enemy;
and it is he who obtains this result; so that the result of the act does
not accrue to a person that did not perform it.”—But in the present case
also, the result, in the shape of ‘having a child with the particular
qualification,’ accrues to the performer of the Initiation (the father);
just as the good health of the child brings pleasure to the father, so
also the Brahmic glory of the son would be a source of pleasure to the
father; so that the result here also would accrue to the performer, who
had sought for it. Further, it is only from the construction of the
actual words used that we can ascertain the meaning of the scriptural
texts; and in the present context, the only construction found possible
is that the father should perform the ceremony with the desire of a
certain result to accrue to his son; and there are no grounds for
abandoning this natural construction of the words.</p>
<p>This same explanation applies also to the case of the benefits of the
after-death rites accruing to the father (even though performed by the
son); as in that case also the performer is the son, and the result is
the satisfaction of the father. Further, we have the text—‘Thou art my
very self called the. <em>non</em>’—which shows that when the after-death rites
are performed by the <em>son</em>, it is the father himself (iṇ the shape of
the son) that makes the offerings to himself; specially as it was with a
view to this alone that the father begot the son.</p>
<p>Then again, in the <em>Sarvasvāra</em> sacrifice (which is performed by one who
wishes to bring about his own death and translation to heaven),—even
after the sacrificer himself has died, the subsequent details have got
to he performed: and in this performance also the same sacrificer is
regarded as the ‘performer,’ in view of the direction that he has given
fo the Brāhmaṇas—‘O brāhmaṇas, please complete this sacrifice,’—as also
of the sacrificial gifts and appointments made by him; by virtue of
which the said sacrificer is regarded as the actual instigator or
employer of the officiating priests. In the same manner, in the case in
question also, in as much as the son was begotten for the purpose of
performing the funeral rites, these rites, though performed (by the son)
for the sake of the father, are regarded as performed by the father
himself.</p>

<p>For the Initiatory Rite, the principal as well as the optional time have
been prescribed. From this it would seem that if, on account of the
death of the father, or by reason of illness and such other causes, the
boy remains uninitiated and the prescribed time has gone by,—he becomes
unfit, for initiation; this idea being countenanced by the faot that,
even though the prescribed time is a secondary factor in the rite, yet
on the lapse of that time, the performer’s title to the performance
ceases; just as we find in the case of omission of the <em>Agnihotra</em>
-offerings after the prescribed morning and evening have gone by. It is
with a view to this that the present verse propounds an exception to the
general rule, and lays down the necessity of performing the rite even
after the passing off of the prescribed time.</p>
<p>Till the end of the sixteenth year after conception, the Brāhmaṇa’s
title to the Initiatory Bite does not cease. The term ‘<em>Sāvitrī</em>’ in the
text stands for the ‘Rite of Initiation,’ which is the means whereby the
teaching of the is accomplished. ‘<em>Does not lapse,’ i.e</em>., does not
become out of date.</p>
<p>Similarly ‘<em>for the Kṣatriya till the twenty-second year</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., for
the person belonging to the Kṣatriya <em>caste</em>. Tho term ‘<em>bandhu</em>’ is
used (<em>a</em>) sometimes in a deprecatory sense; <em>e.g</em>., in such passages
as—‘how doth thou know this. O Brahma-bandhu! (wretched
Brāhmaṇa)?’;—(<em>b</em>) sometimes it is used in the sense of ‘<em>family</em>’;
<em>e.g</em>., in the passage—‘the possession of a number of villages, the
presence of a large following, extensive family-connections (), and
alliances,—these are not to be trifled with even by Indra himself; what
to say of persons possessing only parts of the earth!’;—(<em>c</em>) in some
cases it also means ‘substance’; <em>e.g</em>., in Pāṇiṇi’s Sutra (5.4.9)—‘a
word ending with the term <em>jāṭi</em> takes the affix <em>ca</em>, when it denotes
<em>bandhu (i.e</em>., a substance belonging to a particular class).’ In the
present context the first two meanings of the term ‘<em>bandhu</em>’ being
inapplicable, we take it in the third sense.</p>
<p>The nominal affix (<em>ḍaṭ</em>) in the term ‘<em>dvāviṃśaḥ</em>’ means that which
completes the number twenty-two, <em>i.e</em>., the <em>twenty-second</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>For the Vaiśya till the twenty-fourth year</em>’.—Here also though the
presence of the ‘<em>ḍaṭ</em>’-affix implying completion was necessary, yet it
has not been used in view of metrical contingencies; but the sense is
there all the same. That this must be so is proved by the fact that the
number ‘twenty-four,’ which denotes the entire lot of twenty-four years,
could never form the limit of anything; while tine ‘<em>twenty-fourth
year&rsquo;</em> which is one part of the ‘<em>twenty-four</em>,’ can very well form the
limit.</p>
<p>People explain the particle ‘<em>ā</em>’ as denoting inclusion.</p>
<p>In support of what is said in this verse people cite the Vedic text—‘The
Brāhmaṇa should be initiated with the <em>Gāyatrī</em>, the Kṣatriya with the
and the Vaiśya with the <em>Jagatī</em>’ [the <em>Gāyatrī</em> metre containing 24,
three times <em>eight</em>, the <em>Tṛṣtup</em> 33, three times <em>eleven</em>, and the
<em>Jagatī</em>, 48, four times <em>twelve</em>, syllables]; the ages spoken of in
the text (16, 22 and 24) suffice to complete two quarters of each of the
three metres; up till then the metres retain their force and do ṇot
abandon the castes that form their receptacles; when however the third
quarter has passed, they lose their essence, become aged and having
their force reduced, they disappaer, just as the man becomes <em>old</em> at 50
(which represents two quarters of his life of 100 years). It is for this
reason that the said metres abandon their respective castes, when they
find that they have not been studied by them; and it is thus that (after
the said ages) the Brāhmaṇa ceases to be ‘related to the <em>Gāyatrī</em>,’ the
Kṣatriya ceases to be ‘related to the <em>Triṣṭup</em>’ and the Vaiśya ceases
to be ‘related to the <em>Jagatī</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Sāvitrī</em>’—is the name of that verse which has for its deity; and that
such a verse is the <em>Gāyatrī</em> has been shown above, on the strength of
the <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>.</p>
<p>For the Kṣatriya, the ‘<em>Sāvitrī</em>’ is the verse ‘<em>Ākṛṣṇena, etc</em>.’
(Ṛgveda, 1.35-2; Vājasaneya, 33.43), which is in the <em>Triṣṭup</em> metre;
and for the Vaiśya, it is the verse ‘<em>Viśvā rūpāṇi</em>, etc.’ Ṛgveda,
5.81.2; Vājasaneya, 12.3).—(38)</p>

<p>Burnell, in applying the name ‘vrātya’ to ‘Aryans not Brāhmanised,’
should have quoted his authorities.</p>
<p>Kullūka notes that some people have taken the particle ‘<em>ā</em>,’ ‘till,’ in
the sense of ‘until the beginning of’.</p>
<p>This verse has been quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 342), where
it is pointed out that the ‘sixteenth’ and other years mentioned here
should be counted ‘from conception,’ as in the case of the <em>eighth</em> and
others in verse 36. It points out that this verse lays down the many
secondary occasions for the performance of the ceremony.</p>
<p>This same work on p. 344, refers to the passage in Medhātithi, where a
Vedic text is quoted, which connects. the <em>Gāyatrī Triṣṭup</em> and <em>Jagati</em>
metres with the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya respectively; and
as under 36, so here also, it explains that the limits fixed in this
verse too are determined by the number of syllables in a foot of each of
the three metres mentioned. A foot of the <em>gāyatrī</em> has eight syllables;
so till the bṇy is sixteen years old, the Gāyatrī retains more than a
third of its force; and it is only when the boy has passed his sixteenth
year (corresponding to the sixteen syllables of the two feet of the
<em>Gāyatrī</em>) that the force of the mantra becomes weakened. Similarly
twenty two years correspond to the twenty-two syllables of the two feet
of the <em>Triṣṭup</em>, sacred for the Kṣatriya, and twenty four years
correspond to the twenty four syllables of the first two feet of the
<em>Jagati</em> metre, sacred for the <em>Vaiśya</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 446); and in
<em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 36) as the outside age-limit for <em>Upanayana</em>;—in
<em>Hemādri</em> (Pariśeṣa, p. 751), which adds that ‘<em>ā</em>’ here denotes
limit;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Saṃskāra. p. 41b);—and in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 72), as Laying down the secondary times for the
initiation.</p>

secondary occasion for Upanayana;—so also <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 184).</p>

<p><em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 36) goes on to add that the dumb and the insane, as

<p>‘<em>With these</em>’—Vrātyas;—‘<em>until purified</em>’—by expiatory rites;—‘<em>duly,’
i.e</em>., according to rules laid down in the scriptures laying down
expiatory rites; <em>e.g</em>., ‘making them undergo three <em>Kṛcchras, etc.,
etc</em>.;’—‘<em>even in times of distress</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., under no circumstances
however distressful;—‘<em>should not establish</em>,’ enter into,
‘<em>relationship</em>’ with them.</p>
<p>The question arising as to whether or not this prohibits all kinds of
relationship, the text supplies the answer in the negative—‘<em>spiritual
or</em> <em>uterine</em> .’</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>brāhma,’ ‘spirit</em>,’ here stands for the Veda; and it is
relationships through the Veda that are prohibited; such relationships
as officiating at sacrifices, teaching and accepting gifts; the meaning
being that one should neither officiate at their sacrificial
performances, nor appoint them to officiate at sacrifices, they should
not be taught, nor should one read with them. Since it is only one who
knows the meaning of the Veda that is entitled to accept gifts, the
accepting of gifts also becomes a ‘Vedic’ or ‘spiritual’ relationship.</p>
<p>‘<em>Uterine relationship</em>,’—the giving and taking of daughters in
marriage.</p>
<p>The specification of the ‘<em>Brāhmaṇa</em>’ is intended to be illustrative
only.</p>
<p>The sense of all this is that, in view of the disqualification here
described, the boy whose father is no more should, if he is intelligent,
try to avoid the disqualification, by presenting himself (at the proper
time) for Initiation. To this end we have the <em>Śruti</em>—“Satyakāma Jābāla
went to Gautama Hāridrumata and said—‘I shall, sir, live with you as a
religious student”; where the boy himself requested the teacher to
inflate him. The initiating of boys is however entirely optional; so
that if the teacher should be found unwilling to take up the initiation,
be should be appealed to by the boy by means of presents, etc.—(40)</p>

<p>Though the term ‘<em>Kṛṣna</em>,’ ‘<em>black</em>,’ is applied to everything that may
be endowed with the quality of <em>blackness</em>,—as we find in the
expressions ‘the black cow,’ ‘the black blanket,’ and so forth,—yet, in
the present context, it is clearly recognised as standing for the ‘black
deer’; firstly because of its occurring along with the ‘skin of the
<em>Ruru</em> deer,’ and secondly because of the directions contained in other
<em>Smṛtis</em> (which clearly mention the <em>black deer</em>).</p>
<p>‘<em>Ruru</em>’—is a particular species of the deer.</p>
<p>‘<em>Basta</em>’—is the <em>goat</em>.</p>
<p>In all the three words (‘<em>kārṣṇa</em>’—‘<em>raurava</em>’—‘<em>vāsta</em>’) the nominal
affix (<em>aṇ</em>) denotes either <em>formation</em> or <em>constitution</em> (<em>i.e</em>.,
either ‘formed out of’ or ‘consisting of’).</p>
<p>‘<em>Should wear</em>’;—the Brāhmaṇa should cover his body with the skin of the
black antelope, the Kṣatriya with the skin of the <em>Ruru</em> deer and the
Vaiśya with the skin of the goat.</p>
<p><em>And also cloth</em> made of <em>śaṇa</em> (hemp), <em>kṣumā</em> (flax), and <em>ūrṇā</em>
(wool).</p>
<p>The particle ‘<em>ca</em>’ (‘and also’) has the cumulative force.</p>
<p>The cloth made of hemp and the rest are not to be used as <em>upper</em>
garments; and the skins are to be used as upper garments; as such is the
proper course. For <em>Kaupīna</em> (loin-slip) and <em>wrapping</em>, the cloth is to
be used.</p>
<p>‘<em>Respecting</em>’ each of the three castes is not related to all the
clothing that is mentioned; nor are they to be connected in the reverse
order; in fact the first Brahmacārī is connected with the first skin and
first cloth, the second with the second and so forth, as we have shown.</p>
<p>An objection is raised—“Even without the express mention (of the
respective order), it would be understood through usage; for instance,
such expressions as ‘shattered, scattered an d burnt by thunder, wind
and fire’ are always understood to mean ‘shattered by thunder,’
‘scattered by the wind’ and ‘burnt by fire’ (even though <em>respectivity</em>
is not expressly mentioned).”</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>.—This could be so understood if the three <em>Brahma-charts</em> bad
been mentioned separately, and if the number (of Brahmacāris and the
clothings) were the same. In the present instance, however, we have the
single term ‘Brahmacāris,’ and the three Brahmacāris are not
specifically named in any order. Further, the number of Brahmacāris is
<em>three</em>, while that of the correlatives is <em>six</em>—three skins and three
cloths. When however the text expressly mentions ‘respectivity,’ the
order of the Brāhmacāris is deduced from that in which they are found to
be spoken of in other texts. And after the ‘three Brahmacharis’ have
been construed with the three <em>skins</em>, they are again repeated and
construed with the <em>cloths</em>. And in.this manner the compatibility of
numbers is maintained. It is primarily with reference to such cases that
the revered Pāṇini has taken the trouble of laying down that ‘when an
equal number of things are mentioned they are to be taken in their
respective order.’ (1.3.10).—(41)</p>

<p>‘<em>Ruru</em>’—has been described by Rāghavānanda as ‘tiger.’</p>
<p><em>Medhātithi</em> (p. 92,1. 11)—‘<em>Smṛtyantara</em>—This refers to Baudhāyana,
<em>Gṛhyasūtra</em>, 2. 5. 16.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p.„ 57) as laying down that the skin
of the <em>Kṛṣṇamṛga, Ruru</em> and <em>Chāga</em> should be worn as the ‘upper
garment,’ respectively, by the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya,</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 446), where it is
explained that the skins mentioned are to be used as the upper garment,
and the hempen and other cloths as the lower garment</p>
<p><em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 20) quotes the second half as prescribing the
cloths to be used by the three castes respectively;—and the first half
(on p. 22) as laying down the skins.</p>
<p>The second half is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskā ra, p. 411) and the
first half also (p. 413).</p>
<p>The verse is quoted in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 36), which adds that the
skins of the Black Antelope, the <em>Ruru</em> deer and the goat are to be used
as the <em>upper garment</em>:—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 430);—and in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 75).</p>
<p>Burnell is again inaccurate in saying that cotton and silk (with the
well to do) are <em>alone</em> used now for outer garments.”</p>
<p>Medhātithi rightly remarks that the <em>triplication</em> cannot apply to the
Kṣatriya’s girdle; as on triplication the bowstring would cease to be a
‘bowstring. Govindarāja agrees with him. So also <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p.
20) and <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra; p. 432), Rāghavānanda explains that
as the bow-string itself is a triplicated cord, no further triplication
would be necessary.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>Muñja</em>’ grass, in Northern India called <em>muṃja</em>, is, as Burnell
notes, the <em>Saccarum Sara</em> of the botanists.</p>
<p>Madanapārijāta (p. 20) explains that the <em>Muñja</em> has ‘<em>tejanī</em>’ as its
other name; and a foot-note adds that it is what is called <em>muragā</em>.</p>
<p>This verge is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 447);—also in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 432), which explains ‘<em>trivṛt</em>’ not as
<em>twisted three-fold</em>, but as ‘going round the waist three times’;—in
<em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 189);—in</p>
<p><em>Aparārka</em> (p. 58); in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 70), which explains
‘<em>trivṛt</em>’ as <em>threefold</em>;—in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 37), which quotes
Medhātithi to the effect that since bowstrings are made sometimes of
<em>leather</em>, the author has added the epithet ‘<em>Maurvī</em>’, ‘<em>Murvā</em> grass’;
in <em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 192), which reproduces the above remark of
Medhātithi, as also his further remark that the string is to be removed
from the bow and then tied round the waist: it adds the following notes:
the ‘<em>Samā</em>’, not uneven, thin in one place and thick in another; it
should be of uniform thickness all through;—the three-fold twist applies
to the hempen cord and not to the bow-string, which would cease to be a
bowstring when so twisted;—it is quoted also in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 43 b).</p>

<p>The <em>muñja</em> is a particular kind of grass; the cord made of that grass
is called ‘<em>Mauñjī</em>.’ This cord should form the ‘girdle,’ hraid,
waist-band. ‘<em>Threefold</em>’—triple-corded;—‘<em>of even thickness</em>’—not such
as is thin in one part and thinner in another; but such as is even
throughout;—‘<em>soft and smooth</em>,’ of soft texture, well-rubbed.</p>
<p>‘<em>For the Kṣatriya the bow-string</em>’;—the string of the bow. The
bow-string is made sometimes of leathern thong, sometimes of grass or of
fibres of hemp or flax; hence the text specifies it as that ‘<em>made of
murvā grass</em>’; this string should be taken down from the bow and made
into the waist-band.</p>
<p>Even though the qualifications of <em>triplicity</em> and the rest apply
literally to all kinds of ‘girdle,’ and not only to that of <em>muñja
grass</em>, yet they cannot be applied to the ‘bow-string,’ as with such
qualifications it would entirely lose its character of ‘bow-string.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Made of hempen fibres</em>’;—the lengthening of the vowel in the second
number of the compound is an archaism. Or, we may take the term
‘<em>tāntavī</em>’ by itself formed with the nominal affix added to the term
‘<em>tantu</em>’ only, and then compound the term ‘<em>tāntavī</em>’ with the term
‘<em>śaṇa</em>’; since the ‘<em>tāntavī,’ the fibre</em>, is a product of the
‘<em>śaṇa</em>,’ <em>hemp</em>, it is naturally spoken of as related to its source
(the hemp) [hence the compound <em>śaṇānām tāntavī</em>—‘<em>śaṇatāntavī</em>’; as we
find in such expressions as ‘the cow’s butter,’ ‘Deva-datta’s grand son’
and so forth]. This hempen cord should be made like that of the <em>Muñja</em>
cord; as the author of the Gṛhyasūtras have clearly laid down that the
Vaiśya’s girdle should have the qualities of <em>triplicity</em> and the
rest.—(42)</p>

<p>Writers declare that the phrase ‘and the rest’ is understood, the sense
being ‘in the event of Muñja <em>and the rest</em> being not available.’ And
the reason for this is that it is only thus that the plural number
‘should be made,’ becomes more appropriate; specially as the diversity
of the girdle has been clearly prescribed in accordance with the
diversity of castes. If the girdle spoken of in the present verse were
meant for that of any one caste only, then the plural number could be
justified only by taking it as referring to the girdle worn by the
endless individual members of that one caste; and further, it would be
necessary in this case to alter the singular number in ‘<em>viprasya</em>’ (of
the preceding verse) into the plural number (to bring it into conformity
with the present verse); and lastly, in this case all the three
alternatives herein mentioned would have to be taken as pertaining to
the one girdle (of the Brāhmaṇa only). And no such multiplicity of
option should be allowed so long as there is any other way of taking the
text.</p>
<p>Thus then the sense of the present verse is as follows—(<em>a</em>) if <em>Muñja</em>
is not available, the girdle should be made of <em>Kuśa</em>; if the
<em>bow-string</em> is not available, it should be made of <em>Ashmantaka</em>; and
(<em>c</em>) if the hempen fibre is not available it should be made of
<em>Balvaja</em>.</p>
<p>The terms ‘<em>kuśa</em>,’ etc., denote grasses and herbs.</p>
<p>This verse is meant to restrict the choice of substitutes; so that in
the absence of <em>kuśa</em>, etc., one would not be justified in using any
other similar substances.</p>
<p><em>Triplicated by one knot</em>. The various numbers (of knots) are not meant
to be restricted to the three castes respectively; they are intended to
be optional alternatives for every one of them. This difference in the
number of knots in the girdle made of kuśa, etc., as well as the other
details laid down in connection with it are to be regarded as regular
injunctions, even though the customs laid down in other Smṛtis are not
necessarily binding.—(43)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 447),—and also in
<em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 20), which latter agrees with Medhātithi in taking
the <em>Kuśa-Aśmāntaka-Balvaja</em> as pertaining to the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya
and the Vaiśya respectively.</p>
<p><em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 433) explains that the term ‘<em>Muñja</em>’ in
the present verse stands for all its variants mentioned in the preceding
verse, and proceeds to quote the view that what is meant is that—(<em>a</em>)
for the Brāhmaṇa in the absence of <em>Muñja, Kuśa</em> should be used,—(<em>b</em>)
for the Kśatriya in the absence of <em>Murvā, Aśmāntaka</em>, and (<em>c</em>) for the
Vaiśya in the absence of <em>Śaṇa, Balvaja</em>; but dissents from it, stating
it as its own opinion, that all the three substitutes mentioned are
meant for each of the primary substances enjoined before. It cites
another view, according to which, since the present verse mentions the
<em>Muñja</em> only, the meaning must be that the three substitutes are meant
for the Brāhmaṇa only; so that for the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, if the
substance primarily prescribed under the preceding verse be not
available, they should make use of some other suitable material
resembling the primary. But this view also is not approved as being in
conflict with the text of Yama, which says that—“in the absence, of
<em>these i.e</em>. the three, <em>Muñja, Murvā</em> and <em>Śaṇa</em>, the girdle should be
made of <em>Kuśa, Aśmāntaka</em> and <em>Balvaja</em>.”</p>
<p>The second half of the verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra) on
page 432, where it adds that the options mentioned do not depend
entirely on the wish of the wearer,—the number of knots being, in fact,
determined by the number of <em>Pravaras</em> of the <em>Gotra</em> to which the boy
belongs.</p>
<p><em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 189) also quotes this verse;—and <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 58),
which explains that the knots are to be made in accordance with one’s
‘Gotra-ṛṣis’;—also <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 37), which quotes Kullūka’s
explanation;—in <em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 193) as setting forth
substitutes for the girdle-zone; it adds the following notes:—The term
‘<em>ādi</em>’ is understood here, the construction being ‘<em>Muñjādyabhāve</em>’,
‘in the absence of Muñja <em>and other substances</em>’; the number of knots is
to be the same as that of the wearer’s <em>Pravara</em>;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 43b);—and in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 80), which adds
the note that ‘<em>trivṛt</em>’ means ‘threefold’; and that ‘<em>Muñja</em>’ here
stands for the <em>Murvā</em> and other substances specified in the preceding
verse.</p>

<p>The term ‘<em>upavīta</em>’ stands for the peculiar manner in which cloth is
worn; as will be explained later in Verse 63; as such, it is only a
<em>quality</em>; and since this <em>quality</em> cannot be <em>made of cotton</em>, the
quality is taken as standing for the thing to which the quality belongs;
the meaning being that the <em>thing</em> that is to be worn in the particular
way should be made of cotton; the term ‘<em>upavītam</em>’ being regarded as
formed with the ‘<em>ach</em>’ affix, according to Pāṇini 5.2.127, ‘<em>upavītam</em>’
being equivalent to ‘<em>upavītavat</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Twisted upwards</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., turned round, coiled upwards.</p>
<p>‘<em>Triple</em>’—consisting of three yarns.</p>
<p>This ‘<em>twisting upwards</em>’ is laid down for that article which, on coming
out of the spinning wheel, has acquired the properties of the ‘yarn’ and
has then been folded three times. That is to say, three yarns should be
brought together and by upward twisting made into a cord, and then used
as the ‘sacred thread.’ Of this cord, either only one or three or five
or seven should be worn. It comes to be known as the ‘<em>sacrificial</em>
thread’ by reason of its being connected with sacrificial performances;
in as much as it is worn for the purposes of sacrificial performances,
it is so called figuratively.</p>
<p>Now, of the three kinds of sacrifice, the <em>Iṣṭi</em>, the <em>Paśu</em> and the
<em>Soma</em> sacrifices, it may be worn single at all these, when they are all
looked upon as ‘sacrifices’ in general (and hence, uniform); or it may
be worn three-fold, when they are looked upon either as performed with
the help of <em>three</em> fires, or as being divided into the <em>three</em> classes
of ‘<em>Ahīna</em>,’</p>
<p>‘<em>Ekāha</em>’ and ‘<em>Satra</em>’; or again, it may be worn seven-fold, in view of
the number of stages in the Soma sacrifice being <em>seven</em>; or lastly, it
may be worn five-fold, in view of there being <em>three</em> ‘Savanas’
(extractions of Soma-juice) and two ‘<em>Sandhyās</em>’ (twilights).</p>
<p>[In the absence of Cotton], the ‘Thread’ may be made of silk and other
fibres also; such is the direction given ill other <em>Smṛtis</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Avi</em>’ is <em>sheep</em>; the yarn made of wool is ‘woolen fibre’; the term
‘<em>ārik?sūtrikam</em>’ being formed with the ‘<em>ṭhañ</em>’ affix, according to the
<em>Vārtika on</em> Paṇini 4.3.60. Or, we may read ‘<em>avikasūtrikam</em>’ this word
being formed with the ‘<em>ṭhan</em>’ affix having the sense of the
possessive.—(14)</p>

quoted in Parāśaramādhava and Madanapārijāta—‘That which is twisted
threefold by the right hand moving upward’—<em>i.e</em>. twisted towards the
right.</p>
<p>‘<em>Trivṛt</em>’—has been explained in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> as standing for
‘consisting of <em>nine</em> threads’; and thus on the basis of a <em>Śruti</em> text
which defines ‘<em>Trivṛt</em>’ as <em>nine</em>. The same explanation is given in
<em>Aparārka</em> also;—so also <em>Smṛtikaumudī</em> (p. 6.)</p>

<p>Even though the text uses the Copulative Compound (which implies that
two staves have to be carried), yet, in as much as in connection with
the detailed qualifications of the staff laid down in the text, we find
the singular number used,—<em>e.g</em>., in the next verse, and in Verse 18
below,—it is understood that only one staff is to be carried; specially
as in the <em>Gṛhya-sūtra</em> we read—‘the Brāhmaṇa’s <em>staff</em>’ is of Bilva or
Palāśa’; and the Gautama-sūtra speaks of the carrying of <em>one</em> staff
only. In the present context all that is done is to lay down the mere
possibility of the staff; the expression ‘should have staves’ meaning
that the said staves are fit for Brahmacārīs. As regards the question as
to the act during which the staff is to be held, we shall have the
answer in Verse 48 below; so that the <em>staff</em> being only an auxiliary to
that act, the singular number used in that verse must be regarded as
significant. For these reasons the</p>
<p>Dual number used in the present verse must be taken merely as referring
to all possible staves; just like the plural number in the assertion—‘if
God were to give rain <em>many persons</em> would take to cultivation.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Bilva</em>,’ ‘<em>Palāśa</em>,’ ‘<em>Vaṭa</em>,’ ‘<em>Khadira’ Pīlu</em>’ and ‘<em>bara</em>’ are
names of particular species of trees.</p>
<p>‘<em>Bailva</em>’ means ‘made of Bilva’; and so with the rest.</p>
<p>The naming of the woods is meant to be merely illustrative; as the
general rule is that ‘staves made of sacred woods are fit for all
castes’ (<em>Gautama</em> 1.1.24).</p>
<p>These staves the Brahmacārīs ‘<em>should</em> <em>have</em>’ during the act to be
described below (in 48);—‘<em>by law</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., in accordance with
scriptural injunctions.—(45)</p>

<em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 930), which last points out that the copulative
compound ‘<em>bailvapālaśau</em>’ should not be taken to imply that two staves
have to be taken up; because later on, in verse 48, we have the singular
form ‘<em>daṇḍam</em>’;—in <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 189), and <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 57);—in

staves is not meant, only one staff being held, as is clear from the
singular number in the next verse; they are to be taken as optional
alternatives;—and in <em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 193), which, along with
<em>Mayūkha</em> reads ‘<em>paippala</em>’ or ‘<em>pailava</em>,’ and adds that option is
clearly meant.</p>

<p>The term ‘staff’ denotes the particular shape (of the wood carried);—a
long piece of wood of a well-defined size is called ‘<em>staff</em>.’</p>
<p>The question arising as to what its length should be, the Text answers
it. That which reaches up to the end of the hair is called
‘<em>Keśāntika</em>,’ <em>i.e</em>., reaching up to the head; <em>i.e</em>., in size it
should reach from the tip of the foot up to the head. Or, the compound
‘<em>Keśānta</em>.’ may be expounded as ‘that of which the hair forms the end,’
the <em>ka</em> coming in as an additional affix at the end of the compound.</p>
<p>‘<em>In size</em>,’—the staff—‘<em>should be made</em>’ of the said size,—‘<em>for the
Brāhmaṇa</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., by the Teacher.</p>
<p>‘<em>Reaching to the forehead</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., of the size reaching up to the
forehead. The ‘forehead’ itself is only four inches in width; and as a
piece of wood of that size could never be spoken of as ‘staff,’ we have
to explain the term ‘<em>lalāṭasamnitaḥ</em>’ (which, as it stands, means ‘of
the size of the forehead’) as meaning ‘that which reaches from the tip
of the foot up to the forehead.’</p>

<p>After the skins have been put on, the tying of the girdle should be
done; and after having tied the girdle, the Initiation should be
performed; the staff is taken up after the ‘sacred thread’ ceremony has
been performed. After the staff has been taken up, the Sun should be
worshipped; <em>i.e</em>., one should stand facing the sun and worship Him with
those Mantras of which the sun is the presiding deity; what are the
particular Mantras to be employed can be ascertained from the
<em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>; as also the other details of procedure.</p>
<p>The present verse describes only what is common to all persons.</p>
<p>‘<em>Having walked round the</em> <em>fire</em> <em>to his right</em>,’—having passed all
round it.</p>
<p>‘<em>Gharet</em>’—(lit.) should accomplish;—‘<em>alms</em>’ is a collective term,
stauding for collection of fool;—this he ‘<em>should beg</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>According to prescribed rule</em>’—refers to the rules going to be laid
down below. The term ‘<em>bhikṣū</em>’ (food) stands for small quantities of
cooked rice, etc.—(18)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 451), where it is
explained that the Sun is to be worshiped as the sum total of the
connotation of the <em>Gāyatrī-mantra</em>;—and that one is to realise that he
is one with that deity. According to this authority the
‘<em>parītyāgnim</em>’means, not that the boy is to ‘walk round the fire’ (as
explained by Kullūka and Medhātithi), but that he should <em>tend the
fire</em>; and it proceeds to point out that the ‘tending of the fire’ is to
be done according to what has been laid down by Manu himself under 2.
186.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see how this writer would construe the adverb
‘<em>pradakṣiṇam</em>.’</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 935) in support of the view
that the particle ‘<em>atha</em>’ in the <em>Gṛhya-sūtra</em>: ‘<em>aiha
bhaikṣyañcarati</em>’ stands for the Upasthāna of the Sun and ‘<em>pradakṣiṇa</em>’
of the Fire;—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 32); the latter explaining
‘<em>īpsitam</em>’ by ‘as prescribed for each individual, and not any other’,
adds that the Sun is to be worshipped with mantras sacred to that deity.
It accepts Medhātithi’s explanation of the phrase ‘<em>parityāgnim</em>’; and
points out that the three acts mentioned here all form part of the
procedure of ‘begging.’</p>
<p>It is quoted also in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 481), according to
which also, ‘<em>īpsitam</em>’ means ‘what is prescribed for each particular
caste’;—and the phrase ‘<em>bhāskaram upasthāya</em>’ (though it quotes the
latter term as ‘<em>abhi-vādya</em>’) as ‘facing the sun’ (which is the
explanation, it adds, suggested by <em>Kalpataru</em>);—and ‘<em>Yathāvidhi</em>’ as
‘according to the rule laid down in the next verse.’ It adds that all
the three acts are subsidiary to the act of <em>begging</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 60);—in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 60);—in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 108), which explains ‘<em>Yathāvidhi</em>’ as
‘according to the ordinances—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyāvahāra, p. 124

<p>The word ‘<em>bhaikṣam</em>’ here stands for the words with which the request
for alms is preferred; as it is only the words that can have ‘<em>bhavat</em>’
as the ‘beginning’; the food itself could not have any such beginning.</p>
<p>In as much as it is laid down that ladies are the first to be begged
from first, and in the request made it is the person begged from that is
addressed, it is the feminine vocative form of the term ‘<em>bhavat</em>’ that
should be used.</p>
<p>All that the present text does is to lay down the order of the words to
he used, there being some transcendental purpose served by the order.
The actual words used should be—‘<em>bhavati bhikṣām dehi</em>,’ ‘O Lady, give
me food.’</p>
<p><em>Question</em>,—“ Wherefore could there be any possibility of</p>
<p>Sanskrit words being used, since they are addressed to women, and they
do not understand Sanskrit</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>.—The Initiatory ceremony, being compulsory, is of an eternal
character; and it is in connection with this ceremony that the use of
the words is laid down. The vernaculars (corrupt languages) are not
eternal; so that there could be no connection between these and an
eternal ceremony. Then again, just as when educated people hear corrupt
forms of words used, they are reminded, by the resemblance, of the
corresponding correct forms and thereby come to comprehend the
meaning;—for instance, the (incorrect) word ‘<em>?ā</em>’ leads to the
inference (remembrance of) of the (correct) word ‘<em>go&rsquo;</em> through
similarity, according to the theory that ‘the incorrect word is
expressive only by inference, and the meaning is comprehended from the
inferred correct word’; in the same manner when correct words are
addressed to women, they remember, through similarity, the corresponding
incorrect words whoso meaning they know, and thus they come to
comprehend the; meaning of the words used. Further, the expression in
question is a short, one consisting of three words only, and these being
well-known words, they would be easily comprehensible by ladies also.</p>
<p>Similarly the <em>Kṣatriya</em> should use words of which the ‘<em>bhavat</em>’ forms
the middle; the actual form being ‘<em>bhikṣām bhavati dehi</em>,’ ‘Give me, O
Lady, food.’ So the Vaiśya should use words of which ‘<em>bhavat</em>’ forms
the end. The word ‘<em>bhavaduttaram</em>’ means ‘that of which <em>bhavat</em> forms
the end’;—the compound thus standing for the sentence (give me food, O
Lady’).</p>
<p>‘<em>Having undergone Initiation</em>’;—the past-participial ending implies
that the rule laid down here is to be observed also in connection with
the begging for food for daily living (even after the first day of the
initiation); and further, what is said in verse 68 below—‘such is the
procedure of initiation for the twice-born’—is a summing up of the whole
section on ‘Initiation’; and hence shows that the rule laid down in the
present verse applies also to that begging for alms whicḥ forms part of
the ceremony of Initiation. If we do not take it thus, then what is laid
down here would only he taken either as a part of the Initiation-rites
(as shown by the context), or as applying to the ordinary begging for
food;—in this latter case the implication of the context would be
rejected and stress would be laid only upon the sense of the
past-participial ending (‘having undergone Initiation’) As a matter of
fact, what is here prescribed is applicable to that ‘begging for food’
which forms part of the Initiatory Rites, as also to that which is done
for the purposes of livelihood.—(49)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 936); in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p.
32), which latter adds, the following notes:—</p>
<p>In the phrase ‘<em>bhaikṣam charet</em>’ the verb indicates <em>begging</em>, as is
shown by the objective term ‘<em>bhaikṣam</em>’; it is in view of this that the
expression to be used in the begging is—‘<em>bhikṣām dehi</em>’ (‘give
alms’);—and as the words have to be addressed with proper respect, the
term ‘<em>bhavat</em>’ with the vocative ending (‘Madam’ or ‘Sir’) has to be
added at the beginning, middle or end, according to the caste of the
begging boy;—then, inasmuch as in the house, it is, as a rule, the
women-folk that give alms, it follows that the feminine-(vocative) form
of the term ‘<em>bhavat</em>’ should be used;—thus then the precise form of the
expression comes to be this—(<em>a</em>) The Brāhamaṇa boy should say ‘<em>bhavati
bhikṣām dehi</em>’, (<em>b</em>) the Kṣatriya, ‘<em>bhikṣām bhavati dehi</em>,’ and (<em>c</em>)
the Vaiśya, ‘<em>bhikṣām dehi bhavati</em>’. There is no such hard and fast
rule as that ‘alms should be begged from <em>women only</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 481) also quotes the verse, and supplies
the formula as noted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em>;—<em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 60)
quotes it, and lays down the formula for the three castes as—(<em>a</em>)
‘<em>bhavati bhikṣām dadātu</em>’, (<em>b</em>) ‘<em>bhikṣām bhavatī dadātu</em>,’ and (<em>c</em>)
‘<em>bhikṣām dadātu bhavati</em>—<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 108), which
mentions the formula as given in <em>Madanapārijāta</em>;—and also

<p>Burnell remarks that ‘this begging of alms is now obsolete But so far as
the formality is concerned, it is still gone through at the close of the

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 59) as laying down the rule
relating to that alms-begging which is done as part of the
Upanayaṇa-ceremony.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitittva</em> (p. 936), which adds that these ladies are
to be approached only if they happen to be on the spot, and the boy is
not to go to their houses;—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 34), which latter
quotes it only with a view to explain that there is no inconsistency
between this injunction and the later prohibition (2. 184) of begging
from one’s relations; because the former refers to the <em>begging</em> as part
of the <em>Upanayana</em> ceremony, whereas the prohibition applies to the
usual begging of food during the entire period of studentship.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 61), which adds that this rule
refers to the ‘alms-begging’ which forms part of the Upanayaṇa rite;—in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 109), which adds the same note;—and in
<em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 288), which has the same remarks, and notes that
the first ‘<em>vā</em>’ is meant to be emphatic—‘<em>nija</em>’ means
<em>uterine</em>,—‘<em>avamāna</em>’ means disregard, refusal to give alms.</p>

<p>The term ‘<em>having collected</em>’ shows that the food should be obtained
from several ladies, and a large quantity should not be obtained from a
single lady.</p>
<p>‘<em>It</em>’—refers to that which has gone immediately before this, <em>i.e</em>.,
the food begged for ordinary eating, and not that which is done as part
of the Initiation-rites, with which the context deals; specially as with
regard to the latter all that the Gṛḥya-Sūtra prescribes is that the
food should be ‘cooked,’ and nothing is said regarding ‘eating.’
Further, the injunction that ‘the boy should fast for the rest of the
day’ shows that the boy undergoes the Initiatory rite <em>after breakfast</em>;
so that the actual <em>eating</em> of the food cannot be part of that rite.</p>
<p>‘<em>As much os way he needed</em>’;—<em>i.e</em>., just as much food as may be
necessary for the satisfaction of hunger; large quantities of food
should not be begged.</p>
<p>‘<em>Having offered it without guile to the Teacher</em>;’—<em>i.e</em>., he should
not show the teacher only the inferior articles of food, hiding with
these the superior ones, with the view that the Teacher would not take
any thing out of the inferior articles. The ‘<em>offering</em>’ consists of
presenting it to him, saying ‘this is what I have obtained.’</p>
<p>What the teacher does not take, ‘<em>he should eat</em>,’ after having been
permitted by the teacher to do so.</p>
<p>“Why should not the <em>offering</em> be regarded merely as an act producing in
the food some transcendental effect (and not as a real offering meant to
be accepted by the teacher)?”</p>
<p>That it is not so is proved by historical evidence: says the revered
Vyāsa in the story of <em>Hṛtakūpa</em>, where it is distinctly stated that the
teacher actually took what was offered.</p>
<p>That the boy should eat only after being permitted to do so, is laid
down in several <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>With his face to the east, after having sipped tenter</em>.’—Some people
have asserted that <em>the facing of the east</em> is meant to be connected
with the sipping of water,—the two being in close proximity. But this is
not right; as the rule regarding <em>sipping</em>—that it should be done with
the face towards the east or north,—will come later on. Hence what is
mentioned here is connected with the <em>eating</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Pure</em>.’—This means that after <em>rinsing the mouth</em> he should avoid,
during meals, such tilings as looking at the <em>Cāṇḍāla</em> going to unclean
places, spitting and so forth.—(51)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The preceding verse has laid down the general compulsory rule that the
boy should eat with his face to the East, if he is not desirous of
obtaining any peculiar results; the text is now laying down rules that
are to he observed with a view to definite desired ends.</p>
<p>‘<em>Āyuṣyam</em>’—is that which is conducive to longevity; and ‘<em>Eating with
face to the East, one does what is coducive to longevity</em>’; when the act
of eating brings about longevity, it becomes ‘<em>what is conducive to
longevity</em> ’; hence the meaning of the text comes to be that ‘if one
desires longevity he should eat with face to the East.’ Thus then, in
regard to the East, there are two directions—(<em>a</em>) one should <em>always</em>
face the East, and (<em>b</em>) one should do so when desiring the said result;
so that if a man desires longevity, he should actually have the
particular desire in view; while in the other case he should not have
any result in view. Just as, though the <em>Agnihotra</em> is an obligatory
act, yet if the man seeks heaven, he repeats its performance; and by so
doing he fulfills, incidentally, the obligations of the obligatory act
also.</p>
<p>Similarly, when one desires fame, he should face the South. All these
rules are optional.</p>
<p><em>Desiring prosperity</em>—the form ‘<em>Shriyan</em>’ is formed by adding the
present participial affix ‘<em>śatṛ</em>’ to the nominal root formed by adding
‘<em>kyach</em>’ to the noun ‘<em>Śrī</em>’ Or, we may read ‘<em>Shriyam</em>’ ending in <em>m</em>;
the meaning being ‘<em>what brings prosperity</em>’; just as in the case of the
other words ‘<em>āyuṣyam</em>’ and the rest.</p>
<p>The use of the root ‘<em>bhuj</em>,’ ‘to eat,’ in its literal sense becomes
possible, if we regard ‘longevity’ and the rest as ‘parts of a living
being’; the same explanation applies also to the next clause ‘he eats
what leads to the true.’ The meaning thus comes to be that by‘eating
with face to the west one obtains prosperity.’ In this case we have the
reading ‘<em>shriyam</em>’ with the Accusative ending. Or, lastly we may read
‘<em>shriyai</em>,’ with the Dative ending, which would signify ‘for the sake
of.’</p>
<p>‘<em>True</em>’ means the <em>real</em>, and also the <em>sacrifice</em> or Heaven as
resulting from the sacrifice. The sense thus is that ‘if one seeks
heaven he should eat with his face to the north.’</p>
<p>Even though we have no Injunctive affixes in the text, yet, since what
is here laid down is something not already known, we take it in the
sense of an Injunction, construing the Present Tense as denoting the
<em>fifth</em> sense (<em>Leṭ</em>, which is expressive of Injunction).</p>
<p>Thus then we have this rule of eating with face to various directions,
with a view to various results.</p>
<p>Eating with face towards the subsidiary quarters, which one might be
tempted to do undor special circumstances, becomes precluded by the
obligatory injunction of facing the <em>East</em>, etc.</p>
<p>The optional rule here laid down does not apply only to the Religious
Student, nor to the eating of the food obtained by begging only, but to
all forms of eating by the Householder and others also. That this is so
is indicated by the fact that though in the context we have all along
had the Injunctive word ‘<em>aśnīyāt</em>,’ the present veise has used a
different word ‘<em>bhuṅkte</em>’; if the author had definitely intended the
present rule to be as restricted in its application as those that have
gone before, then he would have used the same word. When however we find
him making use of a different word, ‘<em>bhuṅkte</em>,’ we begin to doubt if
what is meant is the particular eating that has been hitherto dealt with
in the context, or a general rule applying to all forms of eating; and
the conclusion we are led to is that since a different verb is used, it
must stand for a different act, and it cannot be regarded as the same
that has been dealt with in the context.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that—“in as much as there is no injunctive word
in the present verse, it must be taken as merely laudatory of what has
gone before.” But this has been answered in <em>Mīmāmsā Sūtra</em> 3.5.21
(where it is asserted that sentences laying down things not already
known are to be regarded as <em>injunctive</em>). Nor do we find in the present
verse any such signs as would indicate that it is meant to be subsidiary
to the preceding verse,—such signs, for instance, as the fact of its
being wanting in some integral part, if taken apart from the preceding
verse, and so forth. It is possible to take the present verse as
referring primarily to the Religious Student only, and then to extend
its application to all men,—on the ground that what is laid down here is
not incompatible with the duties of ordinary men, as the other duties of
the Student are; but in that case the results mentioned in the verse
would not accrue to the ordinary man. For authoritative writers 8.1.23,
etc.) do not admit of activity by mere implied extension, in cases of
special results following from the use of special accessory details. If
such rules as ‘for one desiring cattle, water should be fetched in the
milking vessel,’ ‘the sacrificial post should be of <em>khadira</em> wood when
the man desires vigour,’ are never applied to the case of those
sacrifices which are mere ectypes (of the Darśapūrṇāmāsa); and to which
the details of the Darśapūrṇamāsa become applicable by extended
implication only.—(52)</p>

<p>‘<em>Ṛtam</em>’—‘Sacrifice,’ an alternative explanation suggested by,
Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p><em>Medhātithi</em> (p. 97, L 20)—‘<em>Guṇakāmanāyām</em> <em>hi</em>, &amp;c.’</p>
<p>This refers to Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 8.1.23 <em>et. seq</em>.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, (p. 431) which remarks that the
verse refers to cases where a man makes it a rule to always face a
certain quarter at meals;—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 34), which adḍs the
explanation that <em>śrīyam</em> and <em>ṛtam</em> are objects to the
present-participle ‘<em>icchan</em>’;—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 377) in
support of the view that facing of the south is not interdicted when
done with a special motive. <em>Vidhānapārijāta</em> (p. 324) also quotes the
verse to show that what is here prescribed applies to that eating which
is done with a special motive, the general law being that one should
face the east or the north .—<em>Aparārka</em> (p. 61) quotes the verse, and
adds the following explanation:—If one eats facing the east, it brings
longevity; one who eats facing the west, obtains prosperity; who eats
facing the north attains the truth or the sacrifice.—Thus eating with
face towards the east is both compulsory (as laid down in the preceding
verse) and optional, done with a special motive (as mentioned here).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 115), which adds the
following notes—‘<em>āyuṣyam</em>’ means ‘conducive to longevity’—one who eats
facing the east obtains longevity; hence the meaning of the text is that
‘one who seeks for longevity should eat facing the east similarly
‘<em>yaśasyam</em>’ meaning conducive to fame’;—eating with face towards the
south brings fame—and similarly one who seeks for wealth should eat
facing the west, and he who seeks for ‘<em>ṛtā</em>’ <em>i. e</em>., the truth, should
eat facing the north.</p>

East, or the West; in connection with rites in honour of Pitṛs, even the
North; but the South he must avoid.’</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata</em> (Āśvamedhika-Parāśaramādhava, p. 395).—‘One shall eat with
wet feet, facing the East, with his two feet or even one touching the
ground.’</p>
<p><em>Old Saying</em> (Parāśaramādhava, p. 309).—‘One should eat seated, facing

<p>The terms ‘<em>ācamana</em>’ and ‘<em>spṛśa</em>’ are both synonymous, being found
from the usage of cultured people, to signify a particular purificatory
act. Though it is true that the root ‘<em>spraha</em>’ has been declared to
have an entirely different meaning, and the root ‘<em>chamu</em>’ (from which
the word ‘<em>ācamana</em>’ is derived) also has been declared to signify the
act of <em>eating</em>,—yet in actual usage we find that with the particular
prefixes (<em>upa</em> and <em>a</em>) they are used in a much restricted sense and
hence they are taken in that (restricted) sense. So that even though the
root ‘<em>spṛśa</em>’ has a very wide denotation, yet actual usage limits its
significance. Just as though the root ‘<em>gaḍi</em>’ denotes only part of the
face in general, the term ‘<em>gaṇḍa</em>’ (derived from that root) is used in
the sense of tho <em>cheek</em> only, and it is not applied to any other part
of the face; similarly the root ‘<em>puṣya</em>’ means <em>to accomplish</em>, and the
term ‘<em>puṣya</em>’ is laid down as denoting ‘lunar, asterism’ in general,
yet in actual usage this latter name is applied to one particular
asterism only; similarly again the term ‘<em>dhāyyā</em>,’ though laid down as
denoting <em>Sāmidhenī</em> verses in general, is actually used in the sense of
the <em>Āvāpikī</em> verses only. Hence the term ‘<em>upaspṛśya</em>’ means exactly
what is meant by the term ‘<em>ācamya</em>’; the actual injunction of this act
of ‘<em>ācamana</em>’ will come later on. Further, the text itself uses the two
terms as synonymous. Having laid down that ‘one should always do the
<em>shana</em>,’ it goes on to say that ‘this <em>ācamana</em>’ should be done three
times; from which it is clear that the two are synonymous.</p>
<p>Though the ‘rinsing of the mouth’ has been already laid down in verse
51, it is re-iterated again in order to show immediate sequence: the
sense being that one should take his food <em>immediately after</em> rinsing
the mouth, and no other act should be allowed to intervene. To this end
we have the following declaration of the revered Vyāsa—‘Oh Lord, I shall
remain with such people as take their food with five limbs wet’—this
being said by Lakṣmī; the ‘five limbs’ being the two hands, two feet,
and month; and these five limbs can remain wet only if one cats
immediately after the rinsing, and not if he makes any delay. Manu
himself (in 4. 76) is going to declare under the duties of the Snātaka
that ‘one should eat with the feet still wet’; and there we shall show
that there is no needless repetition involved in this.</p>
<p>‘<em>Always</em>’—this is added in order to guard against the notion that being
laid down in the section dealing with the duties of the Student, what is
here prescribed applies to him alone; and to show directly that it is
applicable to every form of eating.</p>
<p>Some people have held that “the term ‘twice-born’ is what is meant to
make the rule applicable to every form of eating, and that the ‘always’
is merely an explanatory reiteration.”</p>
<p>This however is not right. This would have been the right explanation if
the qualification ‘twice-bom’ were incompatible with the ‘student’; as a
matter of fact however, the said qualification is quite applicable to
the ‘student’; hence with the exception of the adverb ‘always’ there is
nothing to indicate that what is here laid down is to be taken as going
beyond the particular context.</p>
<p>‘<em>With due care</em>’—That is, with due consideration of the character of
the food and his own (digestive) powers. If one happens to be
absent-minded, he cannot avoid indigestible, unwholesome and hot food,
nor can he eat only what is wholesome.</p>
<p>‘<em>After having eaten, he should rinse his mouth</em>.’—That one should
remove all traces of oil, etc., has been already prescribed under the
section on the ‘purification of substances.’ The ‘rinsing’ here laid
down is that which one should do after he has eaten and removed all
traces of oil, etc.</p>
<p>In this connection some people have held that one ‘rinsing’ (after food)
having been already laid down under 5. 145—where it is said that ‘one
should rinse his mouth after sleep, sneezing and eating,’—the present
verse must be taken as laying down a second ‘rinsing,’ for the purposes
of some transcendental result; there being such a general injunction as
‘having rinsed the mouth, one should rinse it again.’</p>
<p>This aspect of the question wo shall deal with under Discourse V.</p>
<p><em>In the proper manner</em>.—This only re-iterates the injunctive and
obligatory character of the ‘rinsing’; the meaning being that ‘one
should follow all the details of the Binning that have been enjoined.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Should touch with water the cavities</em>.’—‘Cavities,’ <em>i.e</em>., holes in
the head.</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>.—“It is already laid down (under 60, below) that the
cavities should be touched with water.”</p>
<p>To this some people reply that the repetition in the present verse is
meant to exclude the ‘self’ and ‘head’ (which also are mentioned along
with the ‘cavities’ in 60),—and refers to that rinsing which one already
clean, does, without reference to <em>Eating</em>. So that according to those
who take the first ‘rinsing’ after food as meant for cleanliness and a
second ‘rinsing’ as lending to some transcendental result,—the ‘self’
and the ‘head’ are not ‘touched with water’ for the purpose of bringing
about a transcendental result; this being done for cleanliness alone.
The actual process of this rinsing is going to he laid down in 61.—‘One
desirous of cleanliness should always rinse his mouth, etc., etc..’</p>
<p>Another answer to the aforesaid objection is that what the present verse
does is to emphasise the fact of the being recognised as something
enjoined by the scriptures; the sense being that this <em>Rinsing</em> is the
<em>scriptural</em> (prescribed in the Śāstras), not the <em>ordinary</em>, rinsing.
As a matter of fact, where a certain primary act has become known as
equipped with particular accessories, wherever that same act is
subsequently spoken of, it is at once recognised as being the same as
the former one. So that when the text says ‘<em>should rinse his mouth</em>,’
it does not mean merely that a certain substance (water) should be
sipped; what is meant is to indicate all that has been prescribed in
connection with the scriptural purification, along with its appurtenent
details.—(53)</p>

<p>‘<em>Food</em>,’ ‘<em>aśana</em>,’ is <em>that which in eaten (aśyate), i.e</em>., rice and
curry, etc. When the food is brought to him, he should look upon it as a
‘deity’; <em>i.e</em>., he should have the notion—‘this food is my highest
deity.’ (<em>a</em>) The ‘worshipping’ of the food may consist in regarding it
as the source of the birth and sustenance of all living beings; or (<em>b</em>)
in regarding it as the means of sustaining his life; as the food is
declared to have said—‘he worships me regarding me as sustaining life’;
or (<em>c</em>) in receiving it with due obeisance, etc.</p>
<p>‘<em>He should eat it without disparaging it</em>’;—even when there is any such
source of disparagement as that the article of food is of bad quality,
or it is badly cooked, he should not disparage the food; <em>i.e</em>., he
should not make any such disparaging remarks as—‘this is most
disagreeable,’ or ‘it is likely to upset the constitution of the body,’
and so forth. If the food happens to be really defective, he should
simply <em>not</em> eat it; he should not eat it and yet find fault with it.</p>
<p>‘<em>When he sees it he should rejoice</em>’—he should rejoice just as he does
when, on returning from a long journey, he sees his wife and children.</p>
<p>‘<em>He should feel gratified</em>’;—on seeing the food, he should remove from
his mind even such displeasure as may have been produced by other
causes.</p>
<p>‘<em>He should welcome it</em>’;—‘welcoming’ consists in acclaiming it as a
boon; <em>i.e</em>., receiving it with honour, with such words as ‘may we have
such food every day.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Always</em>,’—at all times. The affix ‘<em>shas</em>’ has the sense of the
locative, according to the option involved in Pāṇini’s <em>Sūtra</em> 5. 4. 42.
Or, wo may read ‘<em>sarvadā</em>’ (instead of ‘<em>sarvaśaḥ</em>’).—(54)</p>

<p><em>Pūjayet</em>—‘worship’ (Govindarāja and Nandana.);—Medhātithi offers three
explanations as to what is meant by the ‘worshipping’ of the
food;—Nārāyaṇa takes it to mean that the <em>mantra</em> (Ṛgveda, 1. 187.1)
should be addressed to it Kullūka explains it as ‘meditate upon it as
sustaining life’.</p>
<p>The first half of the verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p.
486), which explains the <em>pūjā</em> as standing for saṃskāra, <em>due
preparation</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted again in the <em>Āhnika</em> section of the same work (p. 382),
where, on the strength of a statement attributed to Śātātapa, it is said
that in the case of food, ‘worship’ can only mean being <em>regarded as a
deity</em>.</p>
<p>The verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 433);—and in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 114), which explains ‘<em>akutsayan</em>’ as ‘not decrying.’</p>

<p>This verse is only a valedictory supplement to the rule prescribed
above; it is not meant to be the statement of definite results following
from the observance of that rule. If it were a statement of results, the
rule would be an optional one, to be observed only by one who desires
vigour and strength; and in that case the adverb ‘always’ would have no
sense;—as we have in the expression, ‘<em>the food thus worshipped always,
etc</em>.’ For these reasons the rule must be regarded as one to be observed
throughout life, just like the rule regarding <em>facing of the east</em>
(during meal).</p>
<p>‘<em>If eaten irreverently, it destroys them both</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., vigour and
strength.</p>
<p>‘<em>Strength&rsquo;</em> is power, the capacity to lift heavy loads without effort;
while ‘<em>vigour</em>’stands for energy and courage, which is found even in a
man who is lean (and physically weak): while great <em>strength</em> is found
only when the limbs of the body are well-developed and the body has
attained huge proportions.—(55)</p>

has apparently been misled by a mis-reading of Medhātithi.</p>

contained in this verse, the necessity of having another prohibition of
the offering of the leavings to a <em>Śūdra</em>,—which we find among the
duties of the <em>Snātakā</em>—we shall explain in connection with the latter
verse.</p>
<p>[In ‘<em>Kasyachit</em>’ ] though the dative would he the proper form, we
have the genitive in the sense of ‘relationship in general,’ and what is
meant is that it should not he given even to such living beings as do
not understand that a certain thing has been given to them,—such for
instance, as dogs and cats; in this latter case the act cannot he called
‘<em>giving</em>’ in its full sense; as it involves merely the cessation of the
proprietary right of the giver, it does not involve the producing of the
proprietary right in the recipient [that is why the Dative could not he
rightly used: which could imply both <em>giving</em> and <em>receiving</em> ].</p>
<p>The phrase ‘<em>antarā</em>’ ‘<em>in between</em>,’ means <em>middle</em>. There are two
times for meals—morning and evening; and one should not eat between
these meals. Or, ‘<em>in</em> <em>between</em>’ may mean <em>interruption</em>; in which case
the meaning is that ‘having once left off the act of eating, and having
interrupted it by some other act, he should not eat the food left in the
same dish.’ Another <em>Smṛti</em> lays down the specific rule that ‘one should
avoid eating interrupted by rising and washing.’ Others again have
explained the phrase ‘<em>antarā</em>,’ as meaning <em>disconnection</em>. The <em>Śruti</em>
having declared that ‘holding the dish with the left hand, ono should
take up the morsel with the right hand and then offer it to the
Life-breath in the mouth,’—it is the <em>omitting of the act of holding the
dish with the left hand</em> which is meant by the terms ‘<em>antarā</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Be should not do over-eating</em>’;—one should not eat too much. This is
with a view to health, and hence implies the avoidance of such food as
may he either indigestible or unsuitable. Specially because the advice
is based upon reason. What is ‘<em>over-eating</em>’ can he learnt from the
Āyurveda. The sense is that one should eat only that quantity of food
which does not quite fill the stomach, and which is properly digested.
Of the three parts into which the stomach is divided, one part itself
should bo filled with food, half a part with water, and one part should
be left for the action of the bodily humours. If this is not done,
health suffers.</p>
<p>‘<em>He should not go anywhere teiṭh particles of food still on him</em>’;—on
the very spot where he has oaten, he should clean himself by removing
all particles of food from the body and then wash his hands and mouth
without rising from the place.—(50)</p>

<p>The term ‘<em>tīrtha</em>,’ ‘Receptacle,’ means a clean vessel containing
water; ‘<em>tīrtha</em>’ (literally) is that which exists for the purpose of
saving people, <em>i.e</em>., freeing them from their sins. In some places
‘<em>tīrtha</em>’ is explained as ‘that by which people descend into water.’ In
the present context however it stands for that part of the palm of the
hand which contains water; and we must take the word ‘<em>tīrtha</em>’ as
applied to the hand, with a view to eulogise it, only figuratively; for
water does not remain in the hand always (and as such it cannot be
called <em>tīrtha</em> in its literal sense).</p>
<p>Through the said receptacle, <em>he should sip water</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Dedicated to Brahmā</em>’;—this also is a figurative eulogy. The term
means ‘that of which Brahmā is the deity’; and certainly the said
‘Receptacle,’ not being of the nature of a ‘sacrifice,’ or of a
‘Mantra,’ could not be said to be ‘dedicated to a deity.’ The special
nominal affix in the word ‘<em>brāhma</em>,’ which denotes ‘dedication to a
deity,’ may however be justified on the assumption that the said
receptacle resembles a ‘sacrifice’ in certain characteristics, such as
being the means of sanctification and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Every time</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., for the purposes of cleanliness, as also as part
of religious performances.</p>
<p>‘<em>Kāya</em>’—‘Ka’ stands for Prajāpati: hence ‘<em>kāya</em>’ is that which is
dedicated to Prajāpati.</p>
<p>Similarly that which is dedicated to the ‘thrice-ten’—<em>i.e</em>., the
Gods—is called the ‘<em>traidaśikam</em>.’ The word ‘<em>traidaśikam</em>’ is derived
from ‘<em>tridaśa</em>’ with the deifìc affix ‘<em>aṇ</em>,’ and then the reflexive
‘<em>ka</em>.’ And the deific character in this case also is of the same kind
as before (in the term ‘<em>brāhma</em>’).</p>
<p>Through these receptacles one should sip water. The mention of the
<em>Brāhmaṇa</em> (Vipra) is not meant to be significant here. For special
rules for the <em>Kṣatriya</em>, etc., are going to be added later on (in verse
62, <em>et seq</em>.); and unless we had a general rule, there could he no room
for specifications [and it is the present verse alone that could be
taken as formulating that general rule, and hence it could not be taken
as restricted to. the Brāhmaṇa only.]</p>
<p>‘<em>Not through that dedicated to the</em> <em>Pitṛs</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., never through that
of which the Pitṛs are the deity; even in cases where the aforesaid
parts of the hand are disabled by the presence of boils and pimples.</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>.—“The mere fact of <em>what is sacred to Pitṛs</em> not having been
enjoined makes it impossible to be used (why should the negation be
re-iterated)?”</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>.—There is one danger in that: The next verse supplies the
description of ‘the receptacle dedicated to Pitṛs’; while there is no
use for it laid down in the present context; so that when one would
proceed to seek for the use to which this particular receptacle could
lie put, he might form the idea that it is to be used in connection with
the act (<em>of sipping water</em>) that forms the subject-matter of the
context. When, h owever, wc have the direct prohibition (of this
receptacle, in connection with <em>water-sipping</em>), we gather the use for
it from its very name, and conclude that the offering of water and such
other rites for the <em>Pitṛs</em> are to be performed with ‘the receptacle
dedicated to Pitṛs.’ In this manner the eulogy also becomes consistent.
The ‘receptacles’ dedicated to Brahmā and the rest being directly
enjoined as those to be used, people might be led into the mistake that
in the absence of these the other may be used; hence with a view to
prevent this it was only right to mention the <em>Pitrya-tīrtha</em> also (as
that which should never be used).—(58)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Āhnika, p. 76), where it is
noted that according to Hemādri, the term ‘<em>vipra</em>’ stands for all the
three twice-born castes, on the ground that Yājñavalkya’s text bearing
on the subject uses the generic term ‘<em>dvija</em>—but this view is
controverted on the ground that it is more reasonable to take, on the
strength of Manu’s use of the particular term ‘<em>vipra</em>,’ the term
‘<em>dvija</em>’ of Yājñavalkya’s text as standing for the Brāhmaṇa only,
rather than the other way about; as in this there is no stretching of
the term ‘<em>dvija</em>’ which is often used for the Brāhmaṇa only; while in
the other case the natural meaning of the term ‘<em>vipra</em>’ is unduly
extended to other than Brāhmaṇas. The writer goes on to quote
Medhātithi’s words (p. 100, 11.20-21)—“The mention of the <em>Vipra</em> is not
meant to be significant here. For special rules for the Kṣatriya etc.,
are going to be added later on (in verse 62, <em>et seq</em>), and unless we
had a general rule there could be no room for specifications; [and it
is the present verse alone that could be taken as formulating that
general rule, and hence it could not be taken as restricted to the
Brāhmaṇa only.”] (<em>Translation</em> pp. 306-307);—and traverses this
argument, on the ground that the present text is not injunctive of
<em>Ācamana</em>, and hence the special rule that follows in verse 62 regarding
<em>ācamana</em> can have no bearing upon this verse; the real injunction of
<em>Ācamana</em> is contained in verse 61. Verse 58, therefore, it is
concluded, must be taken only as enjoining a particular ‘<em>tīrtha</em>’ for
the Brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p>Proceeding with the explanation of the verse, <em>Vīramitrodaya</em>
adds—‘<em>nityakālam</em>’ meaning <em>always</em>; so that whenever <em>ācamana</em> has got
to be done, it should be done by the Brāhmaṇa by anyone of the thfee
methods herein described; and it adds that such is the ‘<em>svarasa</em>,’
‘inclination,’ of Medhātithi also, which clearly refers to Medhātithi,
p. 100, 1. 22. It goes on to point out, however, that the view of many
Digests is that <em>as far as possible</em> the <em>Brāhmatīrtha</em> should be
used.,—such being the implication of the qualification ‘<em>nityakālam</em>,’
which is more nearly related to the first option; and the other
alternatives are to be taken up only when the <em>Brahma tīrtha</em> is
disabled.—‘<em>Kāya</em>’ means ‘dedicated to Prajāpati,’ and ‘<em>Traidaśika</em>,’
‘dedicated to the gods.’</p>
<p>It goes on to add that, though there was no possibility for the ‘<em>Pitrya
tīrtha</em>’ to be employed,—it not being mentioned among those
sanctioned,—yet it has been specially interdicted with a view to
indicate that the <em>Pitryatīrtha</em> is never to be used, not even when
every one of the three <em>tīrthas</em> permitted is impossible, through
pimples and sores: so that in such emergencies, the <em>tīrtha</em> to be
employed would be the <em>Āgneya</em> and others.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Nityāchārapradīpa</em> (p. 64 and p. 253), which
notes that ‘<em>Kāyatraidaśikabhyām</em>’ is the secondary alternative
mentioned in view of the contingency of there being a wound or some
incapacity in the ‘<em>Brāhmatīrtha</em>;—in <em>Śuddhikaumudī</em> (p. 339), which
has the following note—‘<em>Kāya</em>’ is <em>Prājāpatya</em>; ‘<em>Traidaśika</em>’ is
<em>Daiva</em>; ‘<em>nityakālam</em>’ indicates that the second and third alternatives
are to be resorted to only in the event of the using of the first being
impossible;—in <em>Ācāramayūkha</em> (p. 20), which explains <em>traidaśikam</em>’ as
<em>daivam</em>;—in <em>Smṛtisāroddhāra</em> (p. 311), which connects the negative
particle ‘<em>na</em>’ with the whole of the second line, and explains
‘<em>brāhma</em>’ as the base of the <em>aṅguṣṭha</em>, ‘<em>kāya</em>’ as <em>prājāpatya</em>, the
base of the little finger, ‘<em>traidaśika</em>’ as <em>daiva</em>, the tip of the
fingers, and ‘<em>pitrya</em>’ the base of the index finger;—and in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Paribhāṣā. p. 77), which quotes ‘Medhātithis’
explanation of the derivation of the term ‘<em>traidaśikam</em>’.</p>

<p>The ‘root’ of the thumb is its lower part; and the part, of the hand
just below that root is the ‘receptacle dedicated to Brahmā.’—The term
‘<em>tala</em>’ stands for the inner part (the palm). That inner portion of the
hand which extends up to the long palm-line and faces one’s own eyes is
the part ‘dedicated to Brahmā.’</p>
<p>That at the root of the fingers, above the horizontal palmline is
‘dedicated to Prajāpati.’</p>
<p>‘<em>That on the tip of the fingers is dedicated to the Gods</em>’—Even though
the term ‘<em>aṅguli</em>’ forms the subordinate factor in the compound
(‘<em>aṅguli-mule</em>’), yet it is construed with the term ‘<em>agre</em>,’ for the
simple reason that this latter is a relative term (and hence stands in
need of a correlative).</p>
<p>‘<em>That below these two is dedicated to the Pitṛs</em>.’—This also is to be
construed with the terms ‘<em>aṅguli</em>’ and ‘<em>aṅguṣṭha</em>,’ though both of
these form subordinate factors in the two compounds. The ‘finger’ meant
here is the index-finger. Hence it is the part below the thumb and the
index-finger which is ‘dedicated to the Pitṛs.’</p>
<p>We interpret the text in this manner on the strength of what is
prescribed in other Smṛtis, and also upon that of the practices of
cultured people; specially as no sense could be got out of the words as
they stand. Says Śaṅkha—‘Below the thumb and behind the first palm-line
is the receptacle dedicated to Brahmā; that between the thumb and the
index-finger is dedicated to the Pitṛs; that below the little finger is
dedicated to Prajāpati, that at the tip of the fingers is dedicated to
the Gods.’—(59)</p>

<p>‘<em>Aṅgulimūle</em>’—‘at the base of the little finger’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda);—‘at the base of the fingers’ (Medhātithi and Nandana)</p>
<p><em>Medhātithi</em> (p. 101,1. 8)—‘<em>Tathā ca Śaṅkhaḥ</em>’—Though Medhātithi
appears to be quoting the very words of <em>Śaṅkha</em>, the actual passage
from Śaṅkha reads as follows:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kāyaṃ kaviṣṭakāmūle tīrthamūktammanīṣibhiḥ<br>
aṅguṣṭhamūle ca tathā prājāpatyaṃ vica?ṇai |<br>
aṅgus?yagre sthitaṃ daivaṃ piś?yaṃ tarjanimūlake |</p></blockquote>
<p>Here ‘<em>Kāya</em>’ is distinguished from ‘<em>Prājāpatya</em>’ <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> also
cites Medhātithi as quoting Śaṅkha’s text.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Āhnika, p. 77), which offers
the following explanation—‘<em>anguṣṭhamūla</em>’ means the lower part of the
thumb; and on the palm-side of this is the ‘<em>Brāhma-tīrtha</em>.’ ‘<em>Tala</em>’
is the <em>palm</em>; and that part of the palm which extends from the base of
the thumb to the first long line in it constitutes the
‘<em>Brāhma-tīrtha</em>’; and the part which lies between the base of the
fingers and the long line parallel to them is the ‘<em>Kāya-tīrtha</em>’;—and
at the tip of the fingers lies the ‘<em>Daiva-tīrtha</em>.’—The term ‘<em>agre</em>’
is to be construed with ‘<em>aṅguli</em>,’ which is the predominant factor in
the compound ‘<em>aṅgulimūle</em>.’—‘<em>Pitryam tayoradhaḥ</em>.’—Here also ‘<em>tayoḥ</em>’
stands for the two terms ‘<em>aṅguli</em>’ and ‘<em>aṅguṣṭha</em>’; and the particular
‘<em>aṅguli</em>’ or ‘finger’ meant here is the ‘<em>fore-finger</em>; so that the
‘<em>Pitrya-tīrtha</em>’ would be ‘below’ the thumb and the forefinger.—The
words of the text as they stand, if taken literally, do not yield any
sense; that is why recourse has been taken to the more or less indirect
construction, as explained above.</p>

<p>Through any one of the aforesaid ‘receptacles’ he should three times
‘<em>sip water</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., he should let water enter his stomach through the
mouth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Then</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., after the sipping of water,—he should ‘<em>twice</em>’—<em>i.e</em>.,
by repeating the act—‘<em>wipe the mouth,’—i.e</em>., the two lips. This
‘<em>wiping</em>’ consists of removing with a wet hand the drops of water
attaching to the lips.</p>
<p><em>Question</em>.—“Whence do you get the idea that this wiping is to be done
<em>with the hand?</em>”</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>.—We learn this from actual usage, and also deduce it from the
fact of the context dealing with ‘receptacles’ (which have been
described as parts of the band);—the terms ‘through the receptacle’ and
‘with vrater,’ though occurring elsewhere, being brought in here also.</p>
<p>Further, inasmuch as the <em>wiping</em> is meant only to serve a visible
purpose, the term ‘mouth’ is taken to stand for a part of the mouth
(<em>i.e</em>., the lips).</p>
<p>‘<em>Cavities</em>’—holes;—‘<em>he should touch with water</em>’—hold in the hand.
‘<em>Upasparśana</em>’ (of the text) is the same as ‘<em>sparśana</em>.’ Since the
text has been speaking of the ‘<em>mouth</em>,’ the ‘cavities’ meant to be
touched are those pertaining to the mouth (<em>i.e</em>., located in the bead).
Says Gautama (1.36)—‘He should touch the cavities <em>in the head</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>The Soul</em>’—stands for the Heart and the Navel. In the Upaniṣads we
read that ‘one should And the Soul in the heart.’ Hence the ‘touching of
the heart’ becomes the ‘touching of the Soul,’ the all-pervading entity
ensouling the body. (We have to take it in this sense, because) there
can be no <em>touching</em> of the Soul itself, which is something incorporeal.
In some law-books it is laid down that ‘one should touch the navel’;
hence we have included ‘navel’ also (as indicated by the term ‘Soul’ of
the text).</p>
<p>‘<em>Head</em>’—this is well known.</p>
<p>Since all <em>Smṛtis</em> arc meant to serve the same purpose, ‘the washing of
hands up to the wrists’ and such other acts (as are laid down in Gauṭama
1.36, for instance) also hare to be done along with those mentioned in
the text; such acts, for instance, as <em>not making noise</em>, <em>keeping
silent, sprinkling of water on the feet</em>,—or even <em>washing</em> the feet, as
laid down in the <em>Mahābhārata</em>.—(60)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 178);—and in <em>Hemādri</em>
(Śrāddha, p. 992), which adds the following notes:—‘<em>Mukham</em>,’ the two
lips,—the whole for the part,—the ‘holes’ to be touched also are those
connected with the <em>face</em>, <em>mukha</em>;—‘<em>ātmānam</em>,’ heart or navel,—the
Upaniṣads describing the ‘<em>ātman</em>’ as ‘to be seen within the
heart,’—hence the ‘touching’ is to be of the heart, as the ‘Soul,’ being
all-pervading, cannot be touched;—the touching of the <em>navel</em> also is
laid down in other texts—[Hence ‘<em>ātmānam</em> may stand for either the
<em>heart</em> or the <em>navel</em>. ]</p>

<p>‘<em>Hot</em>’ hero stands for boiled; elsewhere we read that the sipping
should be done ‘with unboiled water.’ So that the prohibition docs not
apply to such water as is naturally hot, or has imbibed the beat of the
hot atmosphere.</p>
<p>‘<em>Froth</em>’ is meant to include ‘bubbles’ also, as elsewhere we read that
‘the water should be free from froth and bubbles.’</p>
<p>The terms ‘<em>through</em> <em>the proper receptacle</em>’ and ‘<em>one who knows his
duties</em>’ have been added only for the purpose of filling up the metre.</p>
<p>‘<em>Desiring cleanliness</em>’—seeking to attain cleanliness, <em>i.e</em>., purity.
The sense is that without the sipping of water he can never be clean.</p>
<p>‘<em>Always</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., not only at the timo of eating, as would seem implied
by the fact of the rule occurring in the section on ‘eating,’—but also
at other times, when, for instance, one seeks cleanliness after passing
urine or stool, etc.</p>
<p>Though ‘water’ is the object of the act of <em>sipping</em>, yet it is put in
the Instrumental Case, with a view to indicate that what is prescribed
is meant to be applicable not only to the water that is sipped but also
to that which forms the instrument in such acts as the washing of the
feet and the like. What we hold is that in the act of <em>sipping</em> also the
water is only the ‘instrument’; specially as the <em>sipping</em> does not
constitute the sanctification of the water (in which case alone the
water could be the ‘object’).</p>
<p>‘<em>In solitude</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., in a clean place; a solitary place, being
uncrowded by people, is generally clean.</p>
<p>‘<em>With his face towards the North or the East</em>’;—the term ‘face’ is to
be construed along with each of the two terms (‘East’ and ‘North’); as
Gauṭama (1.35) says that ‘the man should face either the North or the
East.’ The compound should be expounded as ‘he who has his face towards
the North, East’; the compound being a pure <em>Bahuvrīhi</em>, not a Bahuvrīhi
containing another copulative compound <em>[i.e</em>., we cannot expound the
compound as ‘North <em>and</em> East,’ and then compound this with the term
‘<em>mukha</em>,’ the sense in this case being ‘one having his face towards the
<em>North and the East</em>’]. If wo made tho Bahuvrīhi contain a copulative
compound, then if the compound ‘<em>prāṅudak</em>’ were taken as an aggregative
copulative, it should have an additional ‘<em>a</em>’ at the end; nor could it
be taken as a segregative copulative. Further, it is not possible for
the man to face both the North and the East at one and the same time;
for in that case, the rule would mean that one part of the <em>sipping</em>
should be done with face towards the North, and another part of it with
face towards the East; and this would mean that the sipping is not done
at one place. Then again, the directions mentioned do not form the
principal factor in the predicate of the sentence, which alone could
justify their being taken reciprocally; nor does the term ‘<em>prāṅudak</em>’
from a well-known name of the North-East quarter, in the manner in which
‘<em>dakṣina-</em> <em>pūrva</em>’ does of the South-East quarter; hence there can be
no justification for the compound being taken as a containing another
compound name of a particular quarter, <em>[i.e</em>., we cannot take
‘<em>prāṅudak</em>’ as the name of the North-East quarter and then compound it
with ‘<em>mukha</em>’]. For these reasons the. compound cannot be taken as a
‘<em>Bahuvrīhi</em>’ containing within itself another compound. From all this
it follows that <em>option</em>, is meant; as is clearly laid down in another
<em>Smṛti</em>—‘Acts of cleanliness should be begun with</p>
<p>face towards the North <em>or</em> the East’ (<em>Gauṭama</em> 1.35). This option is
just like the option that we have in the case of the Sāman to be sung at
the <em>Ṣaḍoha</em> sacrifice, where the injunction being in the form that ‘the
<em>Bṛhadrathantara</em> Sāman should be sung,’ what is actually done is that
on some days of the sacrifice (which lasts for six days) they sing the
‘<em>Bṛhat</em>’ while on other the ‘<em>Rathantara</em>’ <em>Sāman</em>; and never on any
one day do they ever sing both the <em>Sāmans</em>.—(61)</p>
<p>The ‘sipping,’ as consisting of the drinking of water, has been
prescribed; but the exact quantity of the water to be sipped has not yet
been laid down. Hence the Text now proceeds to define the precise
measure (of the water to be sipped):—</p>
</details>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Āhnika, p. 66), where it is
explained that what the epithet ‘<em>anuṣṇabhiḥ</em>’ means is that the water
should <em>not be heated by fire</em>, as is distinctly stated by Viṣṇu;—again
on page 77, where it is stated to be the injunction of <em>ācamana</em> in
general, for all the three castes;—also on page 79, where it is added
that ‘<em>ekānte</em>’ means <em>not crowded</em>,—where alone the mind can be calm
and collected,—as is laid down by Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>On the tern ‘<em>prāgudaṅmukhaḥ</em>,’ this work has the following note,
criticising Medhātithi’s explanation:—“The term <em>prāgudaṅmukhaḥ</em> must
mean the <em>north-east quarter</em>, on the strength of the declaration of
Hārīta; and in the Śruti also we see the term used in the sense of the
<em>north-east</em>—<em>e. g</em>. in the passage referring to the branch of the
<em>Palāśa</em> tree—</p>
<p>‘<em>Prāchīmāharati</em>, <em>udīchīmāharati</em>, <em>prāgudīchīmāharati</em>’ and also in
<em>Kātyāyanasūtra</em>, where it is said—‘<em>prāgudakpravaṇam devayajanam</em>,’
where the term ‘<em>prāgudak</em>’ stands for the north-east. For these reasons
the assertion of Medhātithi—that ‘the term <em>prāgudak</em> being never found
used in the sense of north-east, it should not be explained as
such,’—must be disregarded. Medhātithi has explained the compound
<em>prāguduṅmukhaḥ</em> as a Bahuvrīhi compound composed of three terms,
whereby the meaning comes to be that the man must face the East or the
North.”</p>
<p>The writer has conveniently ignored Medhātithi’s reference to Gautama
1.35, in support of his interpretation.</p>
<p>The second half of the verse is quoted in <em>Śuddhi-kaumudī</em> (p. 339);—and
in <em>Hemādri</em> (Śrāddha, p. 983), which notes that ‘<em>anuṣṇābhiḥ</em>’ is meant
to prohibit the water heated by fire.</p>

<p>‘<em>Reaching the heart</em>’—that which reaches down to the regions of the
heart; the word being derived from the root ‘<em>gam</em>’ with the ‘ḍa’ affix,
according to Pāṇini, 6. 2.101; the term ‘<em>hṛdaya</em>’ being changed into
‘<em>hṛd</em>’ according to Pāṇini’s Sūtra, 6.3.50.</p>
<p>‘<em>Is purified</em>’—Reaches sanctity; that is, gets rid of impurity. The
water (reaching the heart) would, in quantity, be just a little less
than a handful.</p>
<p>‘<em>The Kṣatriya by that reaching the throat</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., by that which
reaches only down to the throat. The term ‘<em>bhūmipaḥ</em>’ in the text
stands for the Kṣatriya; as the ‘lordship of land’ is laid down for the
Kṣatriya only; and hence this well-known function (of ruling the land)
indicates here the <em>Kṣatriya</em> caste. If actual ‘lordship’ of the land
were meant, then what is laid down here would have been prescribed among
the ‘duties of tho king.’</p>
<p>‘<em>The Vaiśya by the water that is just sipped</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., which is just
taken into the mouth; even without reaching the throat, the water thus
sipped serves to purify the Vaiśya.</p>
<p>‘<em>The Śūdra by what is touched with the end</em>;’—‘<em>anṭataḥ</em>’ stands for
‘<em>antena</em>’; the ‘<em>tasil</em>’ affix having the force of the instrumental,
according to the <em>Vārtika</em> on Pāṇini, 5. 4. 44. The term ‘<em>end</em>’
(<em>anta</em>) means proximity; <em>e.g</em>., the phrase ‘<em>udakānta</em>’ means ‘<em>near</em>
water’. It also means <em>a part</em>; <em>e.g</em>., in such expressions as
‘<em>vastrānta</em>,’ ‘<em>vasanānta</em>’ and the like. With both these
significations the term ‘end’ (being a relative term) stands in need of
a correlative; whenever it is used, one always wants to know—‘<em>near</em>
<em>what</em> ’ or ‘<em>part of what</em>.’ Now in the present case, the water-sipping
has been laid down for the other castes as to he done with certain parts
of the hand and the lips and the tongue; and it is the ‘end’ of these
that is meant. It cannot mean mere ‘<em>proxi</em> <em>mity</em>’; because the
‘<em>water-sipping</em>’ prescribed cannot he accomplished by mere proximity.
Then again, the ‘touch’ (of the water with the tongue and lips) would
involve <em>sipping</em> (which has been laid down for the Vaiśya); for one is
sure to feel the taste of that which is touched with the tongue and
lips. Hence the conclusion appears to he that the quantity of water
sufficient for the <em>Śūdra</em> is just a little less in quantity than that
for the <em>Vaiśya</em>; <em>e.g</em>., while for the Vaiśya the water should touch
the root of the tongue, for the Śūdra it should touch only its tip.</p>
<p>Water being a fluid substance, its going beyond the limits prescribed
would be unavoidable; hence all that is meant is that if the water
sipped fails to reach the prescribed limits, it fails to purify the man.</p>
<p>The description of the ‘receptacles’ (parts of the hand) refers to the
right hand; as it is this hand that should be used in all washings;
specially as it has been laid down that men should perform (religious)
acts with the right hand. It is for this reason that we reiterate this
fact in the present connection.—(62)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 221);—in
<em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 335), which points out that for the Śūdra, there is no
<em>ācamana</em>, as the verse stops short at the Vaiśya; so in the place of
<em>ācamana</em>, the Śūdra should wash his hands and feet;—this is clear from
a text of the Brahmapurāṇa;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Āhnika, p. 74),
where it is explained that ‘<em>antataḥ</em>’ means <em>inside of the mouth</em>; and
hence what is meant is that there should be no <em>drinking</em> of the water,
which should only touch the inner part of the mouth;—such being the
opinion of <em>Kalpataru</em>. It is curious that <em>Kalpataru</em>, as quoted in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em>, has quoted Manu 5.13 9, where ‘<em>antataḥ</em>’ does not
occur at all, and missed the present verse, which, as <em>Vīramitrodaya</em>
rightly remarks, is the text that really supports the explanation
provided by <em>Kalpataru. Vīramitrodaya</em> notes Medhātithi’s explanation
with approval on p. 75.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Kṛtyasārasamuccaya</em> (p. 46);—in <em>Hemādri</em>
(Śrāddha, p. 985), which adds the following notes:—‘<em>Hṛdgābhiḥ</em>,’
reaching the regions of the heart,—‘<em>Pūyate</em>’ acquires
purity;—‘<em>Kaṇthayābhiḥ</em>,’ just touching the throat only,—‘<em>bhūmipoḥ</em>,’
the Kṣatriya;—‘<em>prāśitāḥhiḥ</em>’, just taken into the mouth, and not
reaching the throat,—‘<em>antataḥ</em>,’ the affix ‘<em>tasi</em>’ has the force of
the Instrumental,—the term ‘<em>anta</em>’ meaning <em>near</em> requires a
correlative, that to which <em>nearness</em> is meant,—so that the meaning is
that the Śūdra is purified by water reaching that point which is in
close proximity to that which the water should reach for purifying the
Vaiśya;—and as the <em>tongue</em> is the point for the Vaiśya, for the Śūdra
it must be the <em>teeth</em>; though the water that reaches the teeth must
touch the tongue also, yet all that is meant is that the quantity for
the Śūdra should be just a little less than that for the Vaiśya.</p>

<p>An <em>objection</em> is raised—“As a matter of fact, in treatises dealing with
<em>Dharma</em>, the meanings of words are accepted to be exactly as they are
known in ordinary usage; and the works of Manu and others should not
make it their business to explain the meanings of words, in the way in
which it is done by grammatical and lexicographical works.”</p>
<p><em>Ānswer</em>.—We have already answered this before; if treatises on Dharma
should be found to supply the explanation of such words as are not
ordinarily known, are they to be blamed for doing so? Then again, in the
present instance, there is another purpose also in view. The term
‘<em>upavītin</em>’ is explained in the course of the explanation of the act of
‘water-sipping,’ with a view to indicate that the method (of wearing the
sacred thread, etc.) is auxiliary to that act. Though it is true that
the wearing of the sacred thread,—either as part of a religious
observance, or as accomplishing certain desirable results for man,—is
known as to be done at all times, yet if the ‘water-sipping’ were done
without it, it would remain incomplete. So that, if we did not have the
present text (as indicating the necessity of wearing the sacred thread
during water-sipping), there would be some deficiency in the religious
act, as also some defect in the agent. If the sipping were done without
the sacred thread, it would be as good as not done, and there would be
the additional wrong done, in the shape of sipping the water while
unclean.</p>
<p><em>Question</em>.—“How is it that the <em>Upavīta-method</em> alone is regarded as
auxiliary to the ‘water-sipping,’ when as a matter of fact, the present
text has spoken of another method, the ‘<em>Prāchīnāvīta</em>,’ also?”</p>
<p>Our answer is as follows:—As for the ‘<em>Prāchīnāvīta</em>’ method, this has
been directly prescribed, in so many words, as pertaining to acts of
offering to the <em>Pitṛs</em>; so that when its use has been found in
connection with these, it could not be taken as an alternative to the
‘<em>Upavīta</em>’ method, whose use has not yet been found. Similarly the
‘<em>Nivīṭa</em>’ method also has its use in connection with acts of sorcery.
Though the use of the ‘<em>Nivīṭa</em>’ has not been laid down in the itself,
yet since all <em>Smṛtis</em> have the same end in view, the use prescribed in
other <em>Smṛtis</em> could be regarded as accepted in the present context
also.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>hand</em>’ stands here for the <em>arm</em>; it is only when the man
raises his <em>arm</em> that he is called ‘<em>Upavīṭi</em>’; further, we are going to
point out later on that the ‘<em>Upavīṭa</em>’ is the method (of wearing the
thread) to be employed at all times (not during religious acts only);
and no one is called ‘<em>Upavīṭin</em>’ by merely lifting his <em>hand</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>When the left hand is held above</em>,’ he is called ‘<em>Prāchīnāvīṭī</em>’; it
is the compounded form (‘<em>prāchīnāvīṭī</em>’) that constitutes the name; the
text puts it iu the uncompounded form on account of the exigencies of
metre.</p>
<p>‘<em>On its hanging by the neck</em>’;—‘<em>Sajjana</em>,’ ‘<em>hanging</em>’ means <em>being
worn</em>, when the sacred thread, or the piece of cloth, is worn over the
neck, and neither arm is held over it, then the man becomes
‘<em>nivītī</em>.’—(63)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The present verse enjoins that when these things are damaged, they
should be thrown into water and others should be taken up; and the
sequence of the ‘throwing’ and the ‘taking up’ is to be just as it is
found in the text. In as much as one has got to take up these things
again, they cannot be regarded as forming part of the Initiatory
Ceremony itself; if it were part of this ceremony, then all their
purpose would have been fulfilled by the completion of the ceremony. The
right view therefore is that these should continue to be taken up
throughout the ‘student-stage.’</p>
<p>“But is it not possible to regard the <em>throwing into water</em> here laid
down as the <em>disposal</em> of the things mentioned, if they happen, during
the Initiatory Ceremony—and before its completion,—to be damaged by
divine or human adverse forces? The taking up of fresh ones, would, in
this case, be necessary for the completion of the ceremony; just as
there is of the begging-bowl. Is it absolutely impossible for the text
to be taken in this manner, that the mere fact of the <em>re-taking</em> being
laid down should be made the basis of assuming that the things should
continue to be held throughout the student-stage?”</p>
<p>Our answer to the above is as follows:—As for mere ‘<em>holding</em>,’ this has
been laid down in connection with the <em>staff</em> only (during the
Initiatory Rite); as for the <em>girdle</em> what is to be done during the
ceremony is only its <em>tying</em> (round the waist); so that what should be
done as part of the Initiatory Ceremony is the peculiar <em>arrangement of
strings</em> (which constitutes the act of <em>tying</em>); this being done, the
purpose of the Injunction will have been fulfilled; so that if, at some
future time, any thing becomes damaged or not, what effect could that
have upon the ceremony (which will have been long completed)? As for the
particular form of ‘disposal,’ this helps the Rite only when what has
become damaged forms an integral part of the Rite itself. Nor again have
the scriptures laid down any purpose for which the girdle, etc., are
worn, for the fulfilment of which purpose, the re-taking of them (during
the ceremony) would be enjoined (in the present text); it is only when
the purpose of a certain object has not been fulfilled, that we take it
for granted that that object should be taken up again. For these
reasons, because the text lays down (<em>a</em>) a particular form of
<em>Disposal</em>, and (<em>b</em>) the re-taking of the things, we conclude that,
even though the holding of these may form an integral part of the
Initiatory Ceremony, the necessity of this <em>holding</em> does not end with
the completion of the ceremony. Then again, the girdle, etc., are
mentioned in the same category as the ‘water-pot,’ which continues to be
held <em>after</em> the ceremony also; and this shows that the other articles
also are to continue to be held, and all this ‘holding’ forms part of
the <em>observances</em> (of the Religious Student). From all this it follows
that the girdle and other things are subservient to both: by the force
of ‘context,’ they form part of the Initiatory Ceremony, and since they
are found to be held after the completion of that ceremony, they are to
continue as long as the ‘student-stage’ lasts. That the ‘water-pot’ has
to be carried (always) for the purpose of carrying water is also implied
by (the binding and universal character of) the injunction of the
‘Disposal’; otherwise (if the <em>pot</em> were not meant to be carried
<em>always</em>), the meaning of the injunction would be that the <em>disposal</em> is
to be carried out only when the water-pot may be held; and this would
make the Injunction partial and limited in its application.</p>
<p>As regards the ‘holding of the staff,’ this comes to be regarded as part
of the ‘begging of food,’ on the basis of sequence enjoined in the rule
‘one should beg for food <em>after taking up the staff</em>’, but on the basis
of actual practice, it comes to be done in connection with such ordinary
<em>talking</em> also as is not done for the purpose of ‘food-begging.’ But it
does not mean that the staff should be held <em>always</em>; for the boy who
may be holding the stick would be unable to do such acts as standing,
sitting, sleeping, eating and so forth; similarly in Verse 2.70 it is
laid down that the boy, when proceeding to read the Veda, should sit
with joined palms (and this would not be possible if he held the staff
in his hand).</p>
<p>‘<em>With the proper formulas</em>’—this means that the retaking of the
articles should be in the same manner in which they are taken up during
the Initiatory Ceremony; and in that connection formulas are laid down
in regard to the wearing of the Girdle, and not in regard to the holding
of the staff.—(64)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 451), which says
that it lays down the method of disposing of the sacred thread and other
things whenever they happen to break;—also in <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 190).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 934) which says that, as the use of
mantras is essential, if a certain Gṛhyasūtra does not mention the
mantra, it has to be borrowed from another Gṛhyasūtra;—and in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 423), where also the verse is explained as
laying down the ‘disposal’ of the tilings mentioned. The latter quotes
the verse again on p. 887, where it is explained that in a case where an
injunction lays down a certain act as to be done ‘with the proper
mantras’—as is done in the present verse—and no particular <em>mantra</em> is
prescribed? one has to use the <em>mantra</em> that may be found mentioned in a
particular <em>Gṛhyasūtra</em>. This is what ‘<em>mantravat</em>’ has beeif explained
to mean, in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 37 also.)</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra,, p. 85) as laying down the
disposal of the sacred thread that has been worn out;—in
<em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 39), which notes that the meaning of the term
‘<em>mantravat</em>’ is that they have to be worn with those same mantras that
were used for wearing them at the <em>Upanayana</em>;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em>
(Paribhāṣā, p. 72) as an example of the principle that where the text
laying down a certain act as to be done ‘with mantras’ does not specify
the particular mantras to be used, these have to be taken as laid down
in other <em>Gṛhyasūtras</em>.</p>

<p>‘<em>This whole series</em>’ should be done for females, without the recitation
of Vedic formulas.—‘<em>Series</em>’ stands for the entire body of sacraments,
beginning with the ‘Birth-rites,’ along with all the acts that
constitute their procedure.</p>
<p>‘<em>For the purpose of sanctifying</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., purifying This means that the
purpose of the sacraments in the case of females that is the same as
that in that of males.</p>
<p>‘<em>At the proper time</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., without letting that time pass which has
been prescribed for the several sacraments. The term ‘<em>yathā</em>’ here
signifies <em>non-transgression</em>, and hence, not signifying ‘similarity,’
it is compounded according to Pāṇini 2.1.7.</p>
<p>The same explanation applies to the compound ‘<em>yathā-kramam</em>’ also.</p>
<p>In as much as the text has distinctly asserted that it is only the
reciting of Vedic formulas that may be omitted, there could be no idea
of the sacraments (for females) being performed at a time, or in an
order, other than the prescribed ones; so that the prohibition of other
times and another order should be taken as merely describing what is
already known, and as added only for the purpose of filling up the
metre. All that is really meant by the text is that for females the
sacraments should be performed without the Vedic formulas.</p>
<p>The ‘series’ spoken of above would imply that like the ‘Birth-rite’ and
the other ceremonies, the ‘Initiatory ceremony’ also should be performed
for females; with a view to preclude this idea, the Text adds—</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (p. 926);—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p.
362), where <em>āvṛt</em> is explained as <em>jātakarmādikriyā</em>; and <em>yathākramam</em>
is to taken to mean that there should ho no deviation from the exact
order of sequence—such deviation necessitating expiation;—in
<em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 188);—and in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 30), which explains
<em>āvṛt</em> as ‘<em>kriyā</em>’, act, rite;—‘<em>aśeṣtaḥ</em>’ as along with all details’,
and ‘<em>yathākramam</em>’ as meaning that the order of the sacraments should
not be disturbed or else the <em>Sarvaprāyaścitta</em> has to be performed.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, at several places, on pages
194, 255, 278, 317 and 403). On p. 194, ‘āvṛt’ is explained as
<em>jātakarmādikriyā</em>; and on the term ‘<em>amantrikā</em>’ it is added that what
this interdicts is the use of only those <em>mantras</em> that pertain to the
<em>primary</em> acts of eating butter, honey and the rest, and not the use of
the <em>subsidiary</em> mantras; and this conclusion is in accordance with the
principle enunciated in <em>Mīmāṃsā Sutra</em> 3.8. 34-35, where it is declared
that the qualification of <em>upāṃśutva</em> (silence) pertains to only the
primary rite of the ‘<em>Ātharvaṇa Iṣṭis</em>’ and not to the subsidiary
ones.—On p. 255 the verse is quoted in support of the view that the rite
of <em>Niṣkramaṇa</em>, is to be performed in the case of the female baby
also.—Similarly on p. 278, it is quoted to show that the rite of
‘<em>Annprāśana</em>’ should be performed for the female baby.—On p. 317, it is
made to justify performance of the rite of ‘Tonsure’ for girls.—On page
403, it is quoted as laying down the performance of all the
sacraments—beginning from the <em>Jātakarma</em> and ending with the <em>Keśānta</em>;
whereby it is concluded that the <em>Upanayaṇa</em> also, for girls is to be
done ‘without mantras’; another view is noted, whereby the pronoun ‘this
‘<em>iyam</em> in Manu’s text is taken as standing only for the first five
sacraments, ending with Tonsure, so that <em>Upanayaṇa</em> and <em>Keśānta</em>
become excluded from the category. But this view is rejected; and in
answer to the argument that “in view of the declaration in the following
verse that for women <em>Marriage</em> constitutes <em>Upanayaṇa</em>, the pronoun
‘<em>iyam</em>’ in the present verse must exclude <em>Upanayaṇa</em>—it is pointed out
that all that the next verse means is that in the case of a person
following the opinion of another Smṛti and not performing the
<em>Upanayana</em> for his girl,—Marriage should be regarded as constituting
her <em>Upanayana</em>; and not that in all cases Marriage should take the
place of <em>Upanayana</em>. The conclusion is stated thus:—There are two kinds
of girls—‘<em>Brahmavādinī</em>’ and ‘<em>Sodyovodhū</em>’;—for the former there is
Upanayana, in the eighth year, vedic study, and ‘return’ (completion of
Vedic study) before puberty,—and marriage also before puberty; while for
the <em>Sodyovodhū</em>, there is <em>Upanayana</em> at the time of marriage, followed
by immediate ‘completion of study,’ which is followed immediately by
Marriage. But from the assertion in certain Smṛtis that there used to be
Upanayana for women in a ‘previous cycle,’ it seems that in the present
cycle, it is not to be performed. (Bee note on the next verse).</p>
<p>The above note regarding the two kinds of women is based on a passage in
Hārīta Smṛti (quoted in <em>Madanapārijātā</em>, p. 37), which adds that all
this refers to another cycle. The exact words of Hārīta mean as
follows:—“There are two kinds of women—Brahmavādinī and Sadyovadhū; for
the former, there are Upanayana, fire-laying, vedic study in the house
itself and also alms-begging; while for the latter, when the time of
marriage arrives, Upanayana should be performed somehow and then
marriage.”</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 400);—and in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 00) which explains ‘<em>āvṛt</em>’ as meaning the
Jātakarma and other rites, and adds that this implies that none of the
rites is to be omitted for the women.</p>

<p>The ceremony called ‘<em>Upanaya</em>,’ ‘Initiation,’ has been called ‘Vedic,’
because it is gone through for the purpose of studying the Veda. This
ceremony, in the case of females, consists of the ‘Rites of
marriage,’—<em>i.e</em>., those rites that are accomplished by means of
marriage. Thus, since ‘marriage’ has been prescribed for them in place
of the ‘Initiation,’ the former has been described here as becoming the
latter; and this can preclude the necessity of ‘Initiation’ only if the
purposes of this latter were taken as served by the ‘marriage.’</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>.—“Well, the Initiation may be excluded from women, but the
study of the Veda and the keeping of the observances have still got to
be performed.”</p>
<p>With a view to preclude these two also, the Text adds—</p>
<p>‘<em>The serving of husband is their residence with the Teacher</em>.’ When the
woman <em>serves</em>—attends upon and reveres her husband, she does what is
meant to bo accomplished by ‘Residence with the Teacher.’ The study of
the Veda could be done by the woman only if she resided with the
Teacher; and as there is no ‘Residence with the Teacher’ in her case,
how can there be any studying of the Veda? ‘<em>Household duties</em>’;—all
that she does in the course of her household work,—<em>e.g</em>., cooking,
getting together of articles for household use, general supervision, and
so forth, which are going to be described in discourse IX, ‘the husband
should employ her in saving wealth &amp;c., &amp;c.’ (9.11). These household
duties are for the woman what the ‘bringing of fuel’ in the morning and
evening is for the Religious Student (male). The term ‘<em>tending of</em>
<em>fire</em>’ stands for all the observances and vows that the student keeps.</p>
<p>By reason of the ‘Marriage’ having taken the place of the ‘Initiatory
Ceremony’ (for women), it follows that, just as in the case of men, all
the ordinances of Śruti and Smṛti and custom become binding upon him
after the Initiatory Ceremony, before which they are free to do what
they like, and are unfit for any religious duties,—so for women, there
is freedom of action before Marriage, after which they become subject to
the ordinances of Śrutis and Smṛtis.</p>
<p>Or, we may interpret the text as follows:—Marriage constitutes the Vedic
Sacrament—<em>i.e</em>., TJpanayana—for females; even though marriage is not
really the Upanayana, yet it is spoken of as such attributively. The
question arising as to whence lies the similarity by virtue of which
Marriage is spoken of as Upanayana, the text adds—‘<em>the serving of the
husband</em> &amp;c., &amp;c.’—(67)</p>
<p>The next verse sums up the contents of the section—</p>

<p>‘<em>Vaivāhikovidhiḥ</em>’—‘Sacrament performed with Vedic texts’ (Nandana and
Rāghavānanda);—‘Sacrament for the purpose of learning the Veda’
(Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse has been quotçd in <em>Gadādharapaddhati</em> (Kālasāra, p. 220) to
the effect that for women <em>Marriage</em> itself is <em>Upanayana</em>;—in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 61), which notes that for women,
‘attending’ on husband takes the place of ‘service of the teacher,’ and
‘household duties’ take the place of ‘tending the fire,’ and that for
girls also, before marriage, there are no restrictions regarding food
and other tilings;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, pp. 403-4), where
it is discussed along with the preceding verse (see note on 66). This
verse has been taken as excluding women from <em>Upanayana</em>, entirely. But
the author points out that this is not right; and he sets forth his
well-considered opinion at the end (see note on 66); and the present
verse he takes only as laying down a substitute for the Upanayana in the
case of those women who are not <em>Brahmavādinīs</em>.</p>
<p><em>Vīramitrodaya</em> proceeds to explain the verse to mean that ‘<em>vaidikaḥ
saṃskāraḥ</em>’—‘the sacrament which is gone through for the purpose of
studying the Veda,’—<em>i. e</em>., Upanayana—consists, in the case of women,
in the ‘rites of marriage’; <em>i. e</em>., consecration brought about by the
marriage-rites, as has been “declared’ by the ancients. It points out
that such is the meaning of the verse with the words ‘<em>Saṃskāro vaidikaḥ
smṛtaḥ</em>’ as read by Medhātithi; but <em>Mitākṣarā</em> and other works adopt
the reading ‘<em>aupanāyanikaḥ smṛtaḥ</em>’ instead of ‘<em>saṃskāro vaidikaḥ
smṛtaḥ</em>’, which means that marriage rites <em>serve the purpose of
Upanayana rite</em>; so that marriage would be for women what <em>Upanayana</em> is
for men.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted also in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 37), which also adopts
the reading ‘<em>aupanāyanikaḥ smṛtaḥ</em>.’</p>

<p><em>Viṣṇu-Smṛti</em>, 22.32.—‘For women Marriage is the sacrament.’</p>
<p><em>Vìsmt-Smṛti</em>, 27-15.—‘The Marriage of women is with mantras.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 1.13.—‘For women, Marriage is with mantras.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 402).—‘In former times, for girls
also there was Upanayana, also the teaching of the Veda and the
pronouncing of the Sāvitrī. But she should be taught by her father,
uncle or brother, none else. For the girl, alms-begging is to be done in
her own home; and she should avoid the skin, the rags and also matted
locks.’</p>

<p>067	The nuptial ceremony is stated to be the Vedic sacrament for women (and to be equal to the initiation), serving the husband (equivalent to) the residence in (the house of the) teacher, and the household duties (the same) as the (daily) worship of the sacred fire.</p>
