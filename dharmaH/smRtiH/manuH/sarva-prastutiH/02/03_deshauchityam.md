The sources of the knowledge of Dharma have been described; it has also
been stated that in cases of couflict there is *option*; persons
entitled to the performance of *dharma* have also been indicated in a
general way. Now the author proceeds to describe those countries that
are fit for the performance of Dharma, and where (on that account) it
becomes incumbent to perform it.

‘*Sarasvatī*’ is the river bearing that name. ‘*Dṛṣadvatī*’ is another
river; that which *lies between these two*, that region they call by the
name of ‘*Brahmāvarta*’; that is the region which the cultured speak of
by that name.

‘*Created by the Gods*’—is for the purpose of eulogising the boundaries
and the bounded region; the sense being that ‘the region is created by
the Gods, and is therefore more sacred than all other regions.’—(17)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The Aparārka quotes this verse along with verses 19,21 to 23, as
indicating the views that the ‘black antelope’ is to serve as a mark of
the ‘*yajñīya deśa*’ only in the case of the countries *other than those
described in these verses*. This verse and verses 18 to 22 have been
quoted in the *Madanapārijāta* (p. 12) in support of the view that the
‘Custom’ or ‘Right Behaviour’ that is to be regarded as authoritative
and trustworthy is that prevalent among the people inhabiting the tract
of land herein defined.

Other writers, among whom are Vaśiṣṭha and Śaṅkha define ‘*Āryāvarta*’
as that tract ‘where the black antelope roams’; which, according to Manu
(2.23) is the characteristic feature of the ‘*yajñīya deśa*’ ‘land fit
for sacrificial acts’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Vrata, p. 27),—in the *Vīramitrodaya*
(Paribhāṣā, p. 55), which explains that the epithet ‘*devanirūpitam*,’
‘created by the Gods,’ is only meant to be eulogistic;—in the
*Dānamayūkha* (p. 7),—and in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4).

*Question*—“As regards the *usage* in the said country, what is the
condition of its reliability? Is it *learning* and *culture*? Or the
connection of the particular country is the only condition, and the
practices of the ignorant and the uncultured also arc authoritative? We
ask this because if ‘learning’ and ‘culture’ are not regarded as
necessary conditions, then the two qualifications mentioned in the sixth
verse—in the phrase ‘the Practice of good and learned men’—become
futile. And further, it is not possible for the ‘Practice of Bad men’ to
be a *source of Dharma*, for the simple reason that such persons can
have nothing to do with the Veda. If, on the other hand, *learning* and
*culture* do form the conditions of reliability, then no useful purpose
will have been served by the counection of the particular country herein
mentioned; because it cannot be said that practice of learned and
cultured men of other countries is not authoritative.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—The statement is based upon
probability; the chances are that in the country mentioned only learned
and cultured men are born. This is what is meant by the assertion that
‘*the Practice in that country is called the Practice of good*.’

Others have explained that the verse is intended to deny the authority
of a purely local ‘Practice’ (Usage), on the ground that in other
countries people marry the daughter of the maternal uncle.

This explanation is not right. Because it has been laid down as a
general principle that ‘from among the practices of the country, the
family and the caste, only that should be done what is not contrary to
law’; and the marrying of one’s maternal cousin is actually contrary to
the law, as found in the injunction that ‘one should marry beyond the
seventh grade of relationship on the father’s side and beyond the fifth
on the mother’s’ \[and the maternal cousin falls within these prohibited
degrees\] Further, as regards the said country of Brahmāvarta also there
are certain practices—such as eating in the same dish with boys who have
not undergone the Brahmanical Initiation—which are not regarded as
authoritative. In fact no practice can ever be authoritative which is
contrary to *Smṛti*; because it would be so much further removed from
the Veda (the source of all authority); as the Practice leads to the
inference of the *Smṛti*, and the *Smṛti* leads to the inference of the
Veda; while the *Smṛti* leads to the inference of its corroborative Veda
directly. There is another reason why Practices like the one mentioned
above can never be even suspected to be authoritative. Such Practices
are found to be clearly due to perceptible motives: *e.g*., some one
having fallen in love with a handsome maternal cousin married her,
through fear of the King, in order to escape from the penalty that would
be inflicted for violating the chastity of an unmarried girl; and others
who came after him being themselves illiterate and relying upon the
words ‘one should go on on the same path on which his father and
grand-father have gone’ (*Manu*, 4.178), taken in their literal sense,
came to regard the said marrying as ‘*Dharma*’ (something *that should
he done*). Then again, even though the text (4.172) prescribes an
expiatory rite in connection with the taking as wife of the three
classes of girls (the daughter of the Father’s sister, the daughter of
the Mother’s sister and the daughter of the Mother’s brother),—yet
people are liable to fall into the mistake that marriage with relatives
other than the three specified here is not interdicted. That such is not
the meaning of the verse (11.172) wo shall explain later on.

Now no *Smṛti* or *Practice*, that is prompted by a perceptible motive,
can ever be regarded as authoritative. Says the revered Bhatta
(Kumārila)—‘That *Smṛti*, which is contrary to the Veda, or deprecated,
and which serves a visible purpose, and is prompted by perceptible
motives, can never he based upon the Veda.’

From all this it follows that what is contained in this verse is only an
*arthavāda*, eulogising the particular country,—this eulogy being
supplementary to the Injunction coming later on that ‘the Twice-born
people should betake themselves to these countries’ (verse 21 below).

‘*Pāramparya*’ is the same as ‘*paramparā*,’ ‘Tradition’; which goes
from one to the other, from him again to a fourth person, and so on;
this succession is what is called ‘*Tradition*’; and ‘*Krama*,’
‘*line*,’ stands for ‘unbroken continuity;’—‘*come down*’ means
*learnt*.

‘*Sub-castes*’—are people of mixed birth;—the ‘castes’ along with these
are called *Sāntarālāḥ*.
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Medhātithi* (p. 75, 1. 5)—*Kāraṇagrahaṇāt*.’—When a *custom* or even a
Smṛti rule, is found to be actually based upon some material motive,—no
authority can attach to such custom or rule. Read in this connection
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 1. 3. 4, which discusses the authoritative character of
such *Smṛti* rules as, while not contradicting any Śruti-rule, are yet
found to be due to ignorance or covetousness; *e.g*. the text laying
down that the cloth with which the sacrificial post is covered should be
given to the priest. The conclusion on this point is that such rules
have no authority. (See, for further details, Prābhākara—Mīmāṃsā, pp.
138-139).

This verse is quoted in the Madanapārijāta (p. 12);—in the *Dānamayūkha*
(p. 7);—in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4),—and in the
Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣa (p. 55), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Paramparya*;’ is the same as ‘*paramparā*’, ‘Tradition,’—*i.
e*., that whose beginning cannot be traced;—this precludes the authority
of *modern* customs;—‘*antarāla*’ are the mixed castes;—it quotes
Medhātithi to the effect that the purport of this verse is to eulogise
the custom of the particular country, and not to deny the authority of
the customs of other countries.

**(Verses 18-23)

*Vaśiṣṭha*, 1.7-12.—‘Aryāvarta is the country which is to the East of
the *spot of* disappearance, to the West of Kālakavana, to the North of
Pāriyātra and the Vindhya and to the South of the Himālaya. The Dharma
and practices prevalent in this country should be accepted in all
places. Some people apply the name *Āryāvarta* to the land between the
Gaṅgā and the Yamunā. Brahmanic glory is coterminous with the tract over
which the black antelope roams.

*Vaśiṣṭha*, 15.9-14.—‘The Dharmas and Ācāras prevalent in that country
should be accepted everywhere. The others are of contrary Dharma. Some
people restrict Dharma to the country lying between the Gaṅgā and the
Yamunā. Others again state that Brahmanic glory extends all over that
tract of land over which the black deer roams. The limits of this tract
are hounded on the west by the river Sindhu and on other sides by the
Vaitariṇī river (in Mālwā, according to Vīramitrodaya, Paribhāṣa, p.
57); and by the spot where the sun rises.’ *Vyāsa*, 1.3.—‘The Vedic
dharma can prevail only in that country over which the black deer roams
naturally.’

*Samvarta*, 4.—‘That country where the black deer constantly roams at
will is to be known as *Dharma-deśa*, where alone the duties of the
twice-born can be performed.’

*Baudhāyana*, 1.25.25.—‘To the East of the spot of disappearance (of the
Sarasvatī river), to the West of the Kālakavana, to the North of
Pāriyātra and to the South of Himālaya,—this is Āryāvarta; it is the
*Sadāchāra* of this country that is authoritative; according to some
people it is the tract included between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vīra-Pari.,p. 57).—‘That country is noble which lies
to the East of the mountain where the Sun sets, to the West of that
where the Sun rises, which is interspersed with high mountains and
sacred rivers; this is the *sacred land*; or the land where the black
antelope roams, or that to the East of the Sindhu and the Sauvīra, to
the West of Kāmpilya, to the North of the Pāriyātra and to the South of
the Himalaya,—here Brahmanic glory is complete.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (*ibid*).—‘From Himālaya to the Kumārī (Cape Comorin), from
the Sindhu and the Vaitariṇī and to the place where the sun rises, or
where the black antelope roams,—over this land alone is Dharma present
in its complete form.’

*Viṣṇu*, 74.4.—‘That country where there is no differentiation of the
four castes should be known as the *mleccha deśa*; other than this is
Āryāvarta.’

These are the names of the various regions.

‘*Kurukṣetra*’ is what is known as *Samantapañcaka*, the place where the
Kurus were exterminated. The etymological signification of the name
‘*Kurukṣetra* h as been explained as meaning—‘do good deeds here, and
salvation shall come quickly,’ ‘*kuru sukṛtamatra kṣiprantrāṇam
bhavati*.’

‘*Matsyas*’ and the rest are the names of countries, in the plural form.

‘*Brahmarṣideśa*’ is the name of the entire group. *Brahmāvarta* is the
country ‘created by the Gods’; and since the *Brahmarṣis* are a little
lower in degree than the Gods, this country, being related to
*Brahmarṣis*, is slightly lower in grade than *Brahmāvarta*. This is
what is meant by this being ‘*next to Brahmāvarta*,’—*i.e*., slightly
different from it;—the negative particle (in ‘*a* denoting *slightly*;
just as when it is said that ‘the sick person should drink gruel when it
is *not-hot*,’ it is meant that it should be drunk when it is *slightly
hot*. The term ‘*antara*’ means *different*; as it is found in such
assertions as ‘*mahadantaram*,’ ‘in the case of men, women and water,
even a slight difference makes a great difference.’ (19)

name ‘*Madhya-deśa*.’ It is called ‘*madhya*’ or ‘middle,’ because it is
neither very superior nor very inferior,—and *not* because it is located
*the centre* of the Earth.—(21)

‘*Vināśana*’—This is the name given to the place where the river
Sarasvatī becomes lost in the sands. Buhler says it lies in the district
of Hissar, in the Punjab.

Buhler curiously translates ‘*pratyak*’ by ‘east,’ while it means
*west*.

This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (p. 18), which explains
‘*vinaśana*’ as the place where the Sarasvatī has disappeared;—in the
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣa, p. 56) which locates ‘Vinaśana’ in the
*Kurukṣetra*,—in the *Dānamayūkha*, (p. 7),—and the *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 4).

The country that lies between the two limits of the Eastern and Western
Oceans,—and between the two mountains spoken of in the preceding
verse,—*i.e*., the Himālaya and the Vindhya,—is described as
‘*Āryāvarta*,’ ‘*by the learned*,’—*i.e*., by cultured people. It is
called ‘*Āryāvarta*’ in the sense that the *Āryas line there* (‘*Āryāḥ
vartante tatra*’); *i.e*., it is they that are born there again and
again, and the Barbarians, even though attacking it repeatedly, do not
remain there.

The particle ‘*āṅ*’ (in ‘*āsamudrāt*’) indicates the *outer* not the
*inner* boundary, and it does not indicate *inclusion*. Hence the
islands in the oceans do not come under ‘*Āryāvarta*.’

What are mentioned here are the four boundaries of the country: the
Eastern Ocean on the east, the Western Ocean on the west, the Hiṁālaya
on the north and the Vindhya on the south.

In as much as these two mountains have been mentioned as ‘boundaries,’
they are not included under ‘*Āryāvarta*’; from this people might be led
to conclude that one should not inhabit these mountains. And with a view
to (avoiding) this possibility, the Author adds the next verse.—(22)

Where the deer known as ‘*Kṛṣṇasāra*’—that which is either black with
white spots, or black with yellow spots—‘*roams*,’—lives—*i.e*., is
found, born, —‘*by nature*,’—*i.e*., not that where it resides for a
time only, having been imported as a present of rare value, and so
forth;—‘*that country is to be known*’—regarded—‘as *yajñīya*’—‘*fit for
sacrificial acts*.’

‘*Beyond that*’—*i.e*., the region other than the one where the
*Kṛṣṇasāra* is indigenous—‘*is the land of the Mlecchas*.’ The
*Mlecchas* are the people who are known as lying beyond the pale of the
four castes,—not included even among the *Pratiloma* castes; such as the
*Medas*, the *Andhras*, the *Śabaras* and the *Pulindas*.

It is not meant that the sacrifices are to be performed on the very spot
where the deer roams,—in the way in which they are performed ‘on level
ground,’ according to the injunction that ‘one should perform sacrifices
on level ground’; as we h ave ‘rooms’ in the present tense, and
certainly one could not perform a sacrifice on the very spot, and at the
very time, at which the deer may have started to roam. Further, a
certain place is the ‘locus’ of the sacrifice only in the sense that it
holds a all those things that are operative towards its performance,
either as instruments or agents and the like, and certainly two material
substances (*i.e*., the Roaming Deer and the Sacrificial Accessories)
could never occupy the same spot. Nor can the condition mentioned (the
roaming of the deer) be taken as indirectly indicating some, other time
(than the one at which the *roaming* is being done); as no such indirect
indication is admissible in the case of Injunctions; as has been shown
under the *Adhikaraṇa* dealing with the ‘winnowing basket’
(*Mīmāmsā-Sūtra*, 1.2.26 *el. Seq*.), by Śabara (on 1.2.26), who
says—‘what is meant by *is done* is that *it is capable of being done*’
\[and the *present time* is not what is meant to be emphasised\].

“As a matter of fact, when one thing is spoken of as *located*
(contained) in another, it does not mean that it occupies the whole of
it; so that it is not necessary for the *Locus* to be occupied in its
entirety, as it is in the case of the oil contained in the
seasamum-seed. In fact, even when only a portion of one tiling is
occupied by another, the whole of the former becomes its *locus* or
*container; e.g*. when a man is spoken of as ‘sitting *in the house*,’
or ‘occupying the chariot.’ So that in the case in question what is
described here is the entire country, consisting of villages and towns,
and bounded by hills and rivers; and when the deer roams even in some
part of it, the whole country becomes its *locus*. Hence there is no
force in the argument that ‘two material substances cannot occupy the
same spot.’”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—In the present instance there is
no direct injunction, such as ‘one should perform sacrifices here (in
this country)’; as the injunctive affix is found added to the root ‘to
know’ (in the word ‘*jñeyaḥ*’), and not to the root ‘to sacrifice.’ All
that is meant is that the country spoken of is ‘fit for sacrifices’; the
meaning being that ‘this country is fit for sacrificial performances’;
and this ‘fitness for sacrifices’ is possible even without a direct
injunction (of the actual performance). The fact of the matter is that
it is only in the countries mentioned that the several sacrificial
accessories, in the shape of the *kuśa* -grass, the *Palāśa*, the
*Khadira* and other trees, are mostly found; and sacrificial performers
also, in the shape of persons belonging to the three higher castes and
learned in the three Vedas, are found only in these countries; and it is
on the basis of these facts that the countries have been described as
‘fit for sacrifices.’ The verb ‘*jñeyah*’ ending in the verbal affix
(‘*yat*’) also has the sense of the injunctive only imposed upon it, and
in reality it is only an *Arthavāda* resembling an injunction; just like
the passage ‘*jartilayavāgvā vā juhuyāt*,’ (‘one should offer either the
wild seasamum or the wild wheat’) \[which, even though cotaining the
injunctive word ‘*juhuyāt*,’ has been regarded as an *Arthavāda*
resembling an injunction\],

When again it is said that ‘*beyond this is the land the mlecchas*,’
this also is purely descriptive of the usual state of things; the sense
being that in these other lands it is mostly *mlecchas* that are born;
it does not mean that people inhabiting them are all (on that account)
‘*mlecchas*’; because what is a ‘*mleccha*’ is well known, just like the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ and other well known castes. In fact, the name
‘*mlecchadeśa*’ is to be taken literally, in the sense that it is ‘the
country of mlecchas’; so that if mlecchas happen to conquer a part of
Āryāvarta itself and take their habitation there, that also would become
‘*mlecchadeśa*.’ Similarly if a certain well-behaved king of the
Kṣatriya-caste should happen to defeat the *mlecchas* and make that land
inhabited by people of the four castes, relegating the indigenous,
*mlecchas* to the category of ‘*Chāṇḍāla*,’ as they are in *Āryāvarta*,
then that which was a ‘country of the mlecchas’ would become a ‘land fit
for sacrifices.’ And this for the simple reason that no laud is by
itself defective; it is only by association that it becomes defective,
just as it is when soiled by impure things. Hence, even apart from the
countries designated here as ‘fit for sacrifices,’ if, in a certain
place, all the necessary conditions are available, one should perform
his sacrifices, even though it be a place where the spotted deer does
not roam.

From all this it follows that the statement—‘*this should, be known as
the country fit for sacrifices, and beyond is the land of the mlecchas*’
is purely descriptive, being meant to be supplementary to the injunction
that follows in the next verse.—(23).

‘*Kṛṣṇaṣāraḥ*—Burnell—“What animal is intended it is impossible to say.
In Southern India, a pretty little, but rare, gazelle is taken for it.
It does not however answer to the name so far as its colour (light
brown) goes.”

From the explanation given by Medhātithi the deer meant is that which is
‘black with white spots’, or ‘black with yellow spots’; and there is no
doubt that the animal meant is that which is black in the upper, and
white (or yellow) in the lower parts of its body.

*Medhātithi* (p. 76, 1. 26)—‘*Śūrpādhikaraṇe*’—in Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 1-2-26;
and the next sentence ‘*etaddhi kriyate ityucyate*’ is from Śabara on
that Sūtra,—the whole sentence being—‘*etat* (*i. e. shakyate
kartumiti*) *hi kriyate ityucyate, na ca vartamānakālaḥ kaschidasti
yasyāyam pratinirdeṣhaḥ*.’

‘*Mleccadeśastvataḥparaḥ*’—Note the liberalised interpretation of this
provided by Medhātithi. Burnell curiously enough regards this to be an
‘order to dwell in this land’. There is no ‘order’ to dwell in the
Mleccadeśa. The countries to be inhabited having been defined and all
beyond these being designated as ‘Mlechadeśa’, the term ‘these
countries’ of verse 24 refers, as Medhātithi clearly points out, to
Brahmāvarta, Madhyadeśa, Brahmarṣideśa and Yajñīyadeśa; and the order to
dwell contained in verse 24 also refers to those, and not to the
‘Mlecchadeśa’, which is ‘beyond these.’

This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 18), which
adds that the country described as ‘fit for sacrificial performances’ is
meant to be so used only when the aforesaid four countries are not
available;—in the *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā,p. 56), which explains
‘*Yājñiyaḥ*’ as ‘fit for sacrificial performances’, and ‘*Mlecca*’ as
‘unfit *for sacrificial* performances’;—and in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
4).

The author now proceeds to state that injunction for the sake whereof
the names of several countries have been set forth.

‘*The twice-born people*.’ even though they be born in another country,
should ‘*resort these countries’ i.e*. to *Brahmāvarta*, etc. Abandoning
the country of their birth, they should make every effort to reside in
*Brahmāvarta* and the other countries just described.

In connection with this some people hold that the injunction of residing
in these countries is with a view to unseen (spiritual) results; the
sense being that even though certain results might accrue to one in
other countries also, yet people should reside in these countries; and
when we come to look for the reward of such residence,—we may conclude,
either (*a*) that the residence in the said countries is enjoined as
purificatory, just like bathing in the Gaṅgā and other sacred
places,—the idea being that just as the water of one place is more
sacred than that of another, so also it is only some regions that are
sacred, as has been described in the *Purāṇas*; or (*b*) that from the
mere residence itself the man goes to Heaven, this assumption being on
the analogy of the *Viśvajit* sacrifice.

Neither of these two views is admissible. If the present verse had laid
down such residence as would not be possible (without this injunction),
then there might be some justification for assuming a reward, and for
considering which of the two alternatives mentioned (in the previous
paragraph) is the more reasonable. As a matter of fact however, the
possibility of the residence in question is already secured by the fact
that it is only in the said countries that the performance of the
compulsory and optional rites is possible; in fact, apart from the said
countries, there is no possibility of the performance of *Dharma* in its
entirity. For instance, in the snowy regions of Kāśmīra and such places,
people suffer so much from cold that they are unable to attend to their
evening prayers outside their house; nor (for the same reason) is it
possible to read the Veda in the proper manner, going out either to the
east or to the north of the village; nor lastly, is it possible to bathe
in the river every day during the winter.

-----------------

The implication of the expression ‘*twice-born people*’ is that no
country can be ‘the land of mlecchas’ except when it is inhabited by
mlechhas. For otherwise any man entering that country would at once
become a ‘mleccha’; and as such how could he be a ‘twice born’ person?
It might be argued that—“by merely entering that country one does not
become a *mleccha*, he becomes so only by residing there, and it is this
residence that is prohibited here.”—But this can not bo accepted;
because what is mentioned here is ‘resorting,’ which connotes the idea
of the man being born in one country and then leaving it and going to
another country; and there can be no ‘resorting’ to a place which is
already inhabited. If this were not meant, then the Author would have
simply said that ‘one should never reside in any other country after
renouncing these.’ It might be argued that “the ‘resorting’ being
already accomplished, the re-iteration of it serves the purpose of
precluding others.”—But in that case this would become a ‘*Parisankhyā*’
a ‘Preclusive Injunction and such injunctions are beset with three
defects.

It might be argued that “it is the *abandoning* (of the countries) that
is indirectly indicated, the sense being that one should never abandon
these countries.”

But so long as the direct meaning of a text is admissible, there can bo
no justification for admitting an indirect indication. For this reason
what has been said above cannot be accepted. From all this it follows
that what the words imply is that men do not become ‘*mlecchas*’ by
merely coming into contact with a certain country, it is the country
that becomes ‘the land of *mlecchas*’ through the contact of men
(*mlecchas*).

In as much as service of the twice-born people constitutes the
prescribed duty of the *śūdra*, it follows as a matter of course that
the latter should reside where the former reside; but if he fails to
obtain a living in that country, then he may go. and live in another
country; this is what is permitted (in the latter part of the verse).
When the man comes to have a large family, or becomes unfit for
service,—even though the twice-born person on whom he is dependent may
be prepared to support him,—the *śūdra* may go and live in another
country, where there may be a chance for him to acquire wealth. But even
so he should never live in a country where *mlecchas* form the majority
of inhabitants; he should betake himself to a land fit for sacrifices;
because if he lived in a country abounding in *mlecchas* it would be
impossible for him to avoid their contact, in the course of moving,
sitting, eating and so fourth; so that there would be the fear of his
becoming a *mleccha*.

‘*Distressed for a living*,’—*i.e*., suffering from want of a living.
‘*Living*’ means wealth sníficient for the maintaining of one’s family.
In the absence of such ‘living,’ there is a curtain amount of
‘distress;’ and this distress which is caused by the want of living is
spoken of as caused by the ‘living’ itself; just as good harvest being
the effect of rain, famine is caused by *want of rain*, but is spoken of
as ‘caused *by rain*.’

‘*In any country*’ implies want of restriction.

This verse is quoted in the *Aparārka* (p. 6) as permitting the *Śūdra*
to reside, for the sake of livelihood, in ‘*Mleccā*’ countries also;—in
the *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 56), which explains ‘*vṛtti*’ as
‘livelihood ‘*karṣitaḥ*’ as ‘in difficulty’, and the compound
‘*vṛttikarṣitaḥ*’ as ‘one who is in difficulties regarding
livelihood—and in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4).

*Baudhāyana*, 1-30.—‘Āraṭṭa, Kāraskara, Puṇḍraka, Sauvīra, Baṅga,
Kaliṅga, Prāsūna,—if one goes to those countries, he should perform the
expiatory rite of either Punaḥstoma or Sarvapṛṣṭhā.

*Baudhāyana*.—‘Anantaka (Dvārakā), Aṅga, Magadha, Surāṣṭra, Dakṣiṇāpatha
Upāvṛt, Sindhu, Sauvīra, these countries are of *mixed origin*.’

*Ādipurāṇa* (Vīra-Pari., p. 59).—‘A person horn in Āryāvarta either
twice-born or not, should never cross the Karmāda (Karmanāśā), the
Sindhu or the Karatoyā. The twice-born person should never go beyond
Āryāvarta except on pilgrimage, or in obedience to the order of his
parents.’ In Magadha, the sacred places of pilgrimage are Gaya, the
river Poonpoon; the Hermitage of Chyavana and the forest of Rājagṛha.’

*Vāyu-purāṇa* (*Ibid*).—‘Kāñchī, Kośala, Saurāṣṭra, Karṇāṭa, Kacheha,
Kāverī, Kolvaṇa (land near the Tryambaka Hill, near Nāsik),—these tracts
are not commended. That tract of land over which the five rivers
(Śatadru, Vipāśā, Airāvaiī, Chandrabhāgā and Vitastā) flow is called
*Āraṭṭa*; the Ārya should not permanently dwell in this country. One who
crosses the Narmadā, the Sindhu aud the Kosi, or goes to the West of
Puṣkara, and lives there beyond the time of pilgrimage, goes to
hell.—Aṅga, Baṅga, Kaliṅga, Andhra, Madra, Mālavika, tract to the South
of the Narmadā or to the North of the Sindhu, Pauṇḍra, Surāṣṭra,
Vaindhya, Māgadhaka, Khaśa,—these are all sinful tracts.’

*Vāyu-purāṇa (Ibid*).—‘The country bounded on the South by the Mahānadī,
and on the North by Magadha is the *country of Triśaṅku*, with an area
of 48 square miles; this country should be avoided.’

*Vāyu-purāṇa* (*Ibid*, p. 57).—‘Wise men should take shelter in that
country where there is prosperity due to the black antelope, barley,
grass, the four castes and the four life-stages.’

*Skanda-purāṇa* (Vira-Pari., p. GO).—‘Aṅga, Baṅga, Kaliṅga, Parvata,
Khaśa, Sindhu, Sauvīra, Saurāṣṭra, Pārada, Andhra, Mālava,—these the
twice-born should avoid. But when pressed for livelihood, the
Householder may betake himself to these countries.’

*Bhaviṣya purāṇa* (Do., p. 55).—Brahmāvarta is the best country; less
than that is the Ṛṣideśa; less than this latter is the Madhyadeśa; next
to that comes the Āryāvarta.’

*Chāndogya Upaniṣad* (quoted in Vīra-Paribhāṣā, p. 60).—‘One shall not
approach the Caṇḍāla, nor the inferior country.’

*Pitāmaha* (Do., p. 60).—‘One may reside even in the kingdom of the
Śūdra, if the Gaṅgā flows through it: even though that country may he
inhabited by uncultured people, yet it is a sacred land.

*Vyāsa* (Do., p. 61).—‘Those places, those countries, those mountains
and those hermitages are sacred through which the best of rivers, the
Gaṅgā, flows.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do.).—‘The righteous man should reside at Prabhāsa,
at Puṣkara, at Kāśī, at Naimiṣa, at Amarakaṇṭaka, on the Gaṅgā or on the
Sarayū.’
