<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present section is taken up for determining the exact signification
of ‘*Ācārya*’ (Preceptor) and other terms. As a matter of fact, people
make use of these names on the basis of certain qualifications; and this
particular matter has not been dealt with by Pāṇini and other writers on
the subject of the meanings of words. What the present text says
regarding the meaning of the titles is based, like the Smṛti of Pāṇini
and others, upon usage, not upon the Veda; as it does not prescribe
anything *to be done*; that such and such a word means such and such a
thing is a *well-established fact*, not something *to be accomplished*.

‘*Having initiated*,’—*i.e*., having performed the Initiatory Rite,—‘*he
who teaches*’—makes him get up—‘*the Veda*’—is the ‘preceptor.’ The
‘getting up’ of the Veda here meant consists in the remembering of the
exact words of the text, independently of other learners.

‘*Kalpa*,’ ‘*Ritualistic Treatise*,’—stands here for all the Subsidiary
Sciences.—‘*Esoteric Treatises*’ are the Upaniṣads. Though these latter
also are inoluded under the name ‘Veda,’ yet the text has mentioned them
separately by the name ‘Esoteric Treatises,’ with a view to remove the
misconception that these are not Veda,—a misconception that might arise
from the fact that they have a second name ‘*Vedānta*,’ where the term
‘*anta*’ denotes ‘proximity’ (only, not *identity*).

Others have explained the term ‘*rahasya*,’ ‘*Esoteric Treatises*,’ to
mean ‘the meaning of the Vedic texts’; and by this explanation, the
teaching of the verbal text only would not make one a ‘Teacher,’ it
would be necessary ‘for him to explain the meaning also.’ To this effect
we have the following declaration in the *Abhidhāna-Kośa*;—‘He who
expounds the meanings of mantras is called the *Preceptor*”;—here the
term ‘*mantra*’ stands for all Vedic passages.

In accordance with this explanation, the learning of the meaning also,
and not the mere getting up of the Text, would be prompted by the
injunction of ‘becoming a Preceptor so that for every man the injunction
of Vedic study would come to be carried out by other persons.

“That may be so; but even when the Injunction of Vedic study is carried
out by other persons, the purpose of the student becomes accomplished
all the same.”

In that case then, since ‘becoming a Preceptor’ is a purely voluntary
act, if the Teacher does not have recourse to the necessary activity,
then the carying out of the injunction of Vedic study would remain
unaccomplished; so that this injunction of Vedic study would no longer
be compulsory.

Then again, as a matter of fact, the term ‘*rahasya*,’ ‘*esoteric
treatise*,’ is not ordinarily known as denoting the ‘explanation of the
meaning of Vedic texts.’

From all this it is clear that the purpose of adding the term
‘*rahasya*’ is as explained before.

Or, the separate mention of the ‘*Upaniṣads*,’ may be explained as
indicating the importance of that part of the Veda.

As regards the declaration quoted above—‘he is called Preceptor who
explains the meaning of mantras,’—this is not a *Smṛti* (and hence not
authoritative). Nor is there any ground for taking the term ‘*mantra*’
as standing for *Vedic texts* in general.

For all these reasons it is dear that the purpose of the present
Injunction lies in the reading of the mere Text. So that when the boy
has accomplished the getting up of the words of the Veda, this also
means that he has carried out the injunction of ‘becoming a
Teacher.’—(140)

‘*Rahasyam*’—‘The Upaniṣads, along with their explanations—(Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nandana, and Rāghavānanda);—‘the esoteric
explanations of the Vedas and the subsidiary sciences,—not the
*Upaniṣads*, these being included in the term ‘*Veda*’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse has supplied Prabhākara with his text on which to base the
entire enquiry into the nature of Dharma. Kumārila has taken as his
basic text the Vedic text ‘*svādhyāyo’dhyetavyaḥ*’ (), and has proceeded
to explain that the ‘*Svādhyāya*,’ ‘Vedic Study,’ herein enjoined cannot
be the mere reading up of the verbal text of the Veda, but also a due
understanding of its meaning; and as this meaning could not be
comprehended without careful investigation, it becomes necessary to
undertake the investigation initiated by the Mīmāṃsā Śāstra,

The sentence ‘*svādhyāyo’dhyetavyaḥ*’ contains in reality the injunction
of that Vedic recitation which is done daily, and not of the initial
study and scrutiny of the sense etc. Hence Mādhava (in Parāśaramādhava,
Ācāra, p. 1'40) has suggested that the basic text for Kumārila should
have been that Vedic text which we assume on the basis of the
Smṛti-rules relating to *Upanayana*.

Prabhākara does not accept Kumārila’s view. He argues that, according to
the view of Kumārila, any and every man—twice-born or otherwise—would be
entitled to Vedic study, only if he fulfils the condition of desiring to
know *Dharma*. Prabhākara bases his enquiry into Dharma and Vedic study
on the rule ‘*aṣṭavarṣam brāhmaṇam upanayīta*’, where the Ātmanepada
standing in ‘*upanayīta*’ clearly implies that the *Upanayana*,
Initiation of the Pupil, is meant to serve some purpose for the
Initiator himself; this purpose is no other than the acquiring of the
title of ‘Ācārya—how this title can be acquired is explained in the
present text of Manu, according to which that man alone is to be called
*Ācārya*. who (*a*) initiates the pupil, and (*b*) teaches him the Veda
along with the Ritualistic and Esoteric Treatises. The motive-desire
thus, for all this study and investigation is on the part of the
teacher, and not on that of the pupil; it is the Teacher who desires to
acquire for himself the title of Ācārya and as this cannot be done
without *teaching*, the pupil comes in only as the person *to be
taught*; and as the latter cannot be a pupil until he studies, this
studying by the pupil is implied by the above texts. This explanation
avoids the difficulty of a *non-dvija* undertaking. Vedic study; the
prospective Teacher being a learned man, conversant with the law, would
never admit a *non* - *dvija* pupil. Though the injunction of Vedic
study is thus implied in the above-quoted texts, yet they do not supply
the motive for the pupil; the Teacher’s desire for obtaining a title and
honor cannot serve as a motive for the pupil; hence, it is explained,
the motive purpose of the pupil lies in his desire to learn the meaning
of the Veda; this is what leads him to proceed with the investigation
into Dharma.

This view of Prabhākara has been combated, in its turn, by Mādhava
(Parāśaramādhava-Ācāra, pp. 138-139), who argues that Teaching having
been laid down as means of livelihood, it is clearly a *Kāmya-karma*—an
act prompted by physical motives—and hence *anitya*, non-obligatory; as
such it cannot be accepted as the sole prompter of the act of *Vedic
Study*, which is *nitya*, obligatory; the latter must have an
independent injunction for itself.

It is in connection with the above discussion in course of its
presentation of Prabhākara’s view, that the present verse has been
quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 137); and again on p. 304, where
it is put forward as setting forth the definition of the ‘*Ācārya*’ as
distinguished from the ‘*Upādhyāya*.’

The verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477), as
defining the ‘Ācārya’—where ‘*Kalpa*’ is explained as *a particular
treatise which lays down, on the basis of clearly perceptible Vedic
texts, the practical details of ritual*; and as including the other
subsidiary sciences also;—and ‘*rahasya*’ as *Upaniṣads*,—these being
mentioned separately (from the Veda) by reason of their importance;—and
in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 45) which explains ‘*rahasyam*’ as standing for
the Upaniṣads.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 30);—in *Aparārka* (p. 65), which
adds that the term ‘*Kalpa*’ includes Grammar and the other subsidiary
sciences, as also Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya,—the etymological meaning of the
term being ‘that which *determines* (*kalpayati*) the meaning of the
Veda;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 90) to the effect that the
Ācārya is to teach not only the Veda, but the Upaniṣads, and the
Ritualistic Manuals &c., also.

‘*A part of the Veda*.’—The Mantra only or the Brāhmaṇa portion
only;—Or, without the Veda itself, only the Vedic subsidiary
sciences;—he who teaches this,—and also even the whole Veda, (but)—‘*for
a living*,’—*i.e*., not prompted purely by the injunction of ‘becoming a
preceptor,’—he is an *Upādhyāya*, a ‘Sub-teacher,’ not an Ācārya,
‘Preceptor.’

He who may teach even the entire Veda to a pupil initiated by another
person, is not a ‘Preceptor’; nor is he a ‘Preceptor’ who, having
initiated a pupil, does not teach him the entire Veda.

“If the *teaching of a portion of the Veda* is made the distinguishing
feature of the ‘Sub-Teacher,’ and the *Initiating* is the characteristic
of the ‘Preceptor,’—then what would be the character of that person who
does *not* do the initiating, but teaches the *whole* Veda? He would be
neither a ‘Preceptor’ (since he has not done the initiating), nor a
‘Sub-teacher’ (as he has not taught only a *portion* of the Veda). Nor
has any other name been heard of for such a teacher.”

Our answer is as follows:—According to what is going to be said in 149
such a person would be the ‘Teacher,’ ‘*Guru*,’ Who is inferior to the
‘Preceptor,’ but superior to the ‘Subteacher.’

The terms ‘*api*’ ‘*punaḥ*’ in the Text only serve to fill in the
metre.—(141)

The mention of the ‘Rites of Impregnation’ indicates that the present
verse lays down the fact of the Father being a ‘Mentor.’

‘*Niṣeka*’ ‘Impregnation,’ is the ‘Sprinkling of the semen’:—those acts
of which the ‘Impregnation’ is the first or beginning; the term
‘beginning’ shows that all the Sacramental Rites are meant.

He who performs these rites and also ‘*supports*’—fosters—‘*with food*.’

‘*Chaivainam*’ is another reading (for ‘*cānnena*’). The meaning remains
the same; as ‘supporting’ can be done only by means of *food*. The only
additional sense obtained from this other reading is the reference, by
means of the pronoun ‘*enam*,’ to the boy.

“As a matter of fact, ‘*enam* is only a relative pronoun; and the ‘Boy’
does not appear anywhere here as its antecedent.”

There is no force in this; for whom else (if not for the *boy*) are the
Kites of Impregnation and the rest performed? And ‘reference’ is often
only *implied*, not always expressly stated.

He who does not fulfil these two conditions, but gives one birth, is
only a ‘progenitor,’ not a ‘mentor.’ Nor should the notion be
entertained that, not being a ‘mentor,’ he should not be respected; as a
matter of fact, he is the very first to deserve respect; as says the
revered Vyāsa—‘The Father is the master, the source of the body, the
benefactor, the life-giver, the mentor, the advisor, of all that is
good, the visible God.’

The mention of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ is only illustrative.—(142)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 302) as defining
the ‘*guru*’, the clasping of whose feet has been prescribed;—also in
the *Prāyaścitta-kāṇḍa* of the same work (p. 259), in support of the
view that the term ‘*guru*’ denotes primarily the *father* only;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477), which adds the following explanatory
notes:—‘*Niṣeka*’—the rites of conception; and the sacramental rites
referred to are those beginning with these and ending with the
‘imparting of the Veda’;—‘*sambhāvayati*’ means *nourishes*. The
performance of the rites of conception alone is sufficient to entitle
the man to the title of ‘*guru*’; the other qualifications have been
added only with a view to indicate that the person referred to here
deserves higher honor than the Ācārya;—such is the view of Śūlapāṇi.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 31) on the other hand, states that the term
‘*vipraḥ*’ stands here for the *Father*; from which it follows that a
father who does not fulfil the conditions stated is not a ‘*guru*’ at
all.

The verse is also quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.- 259, p. 1297) in support
of the view that the term ‘*guru'* primarly denotes the *Father*, the
title ‘*guru '* belonging to the person who performs the conception and
other rites, *i.e*., the progenitor himself;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 11 b);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 88), which
explains ‘*niṣeka*’ as *garbhādhāna*, and adds that ‘*annasambhāvana*’
includes the ‘teaching of Veda’ also;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 44), to
the effect that the Father alone is the ‘*guru*’;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra*
(p. 356) to the same effect;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 128) to the
same effect; but it combats the view that the *Father* only is entitled

The rite that brings about the existence of the *Āhavanīya* and other

sentences as ‘the Brāhmaṇa should lay fire during the spring.’

‘*Cooked sacrifices*’—the *Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa* and the rest.

‘*The Agniṣṭoma and other sacrifices*,’—*i.e*., the Soma-sacrifices. The
term ‘*makha*’ is synonymous with ‘*kratu*,’ ‘*sacrifice*.’

He who perfoms these acts for one is called his ‘*priest*.’ ‘*For him*’
and ‘*his*’ denote relation; the meaning being that ‘the performer is
the officiating priest of only that man for whom he performs the acts,
and not of any other person.’

All these terms, ‘Preceptor’ and the rest, are words denoting relation.

‘*Being appointed*’—being requested; *i.e*., whose appointment has been
made in accordance with the rules laid down in the scriptures.

The ‘Priest’ has been described here, in connection with the mention of
persons entitled to respect; and priests have nothing to do with the
duties of the religious student. This description is supplied here only
for the purpose of indicating that the Priest also is entitled, like the
Preceptor and the rest, to respect.—(143)

‘*He who fills both ears with the Veda*’—by teaching—‘*should be
regarded as his Father and Mother*.’

The present verse does not enjoin that the words ‘Father’ and ‘Mother’
denote the teacher; because these two terms, ‘Father and Mother,’ have
their denotations as well known as the words ‘Ācārya’ and the rest,—that
the term ‘Father’ denotes the *progenitor*, and ‘mother’ the
*progenitress*. As a matter of fact, these two terms have been applied
here for the purpose of indirectly eulogising the Teacher; just as in
such expressions as ‘the ploughman is an ox.’ Inordinary experience the
father and the mother are known as one’s best benefactors; they give one
birth, bring him up with food, and seek to do good to their child, even
at the risk of their body. Hence, the Teacher also, being a great
benefactor, is eulogised as being equal to them; the sense being that he
who helps one by imparting learning is superior to all other
benefactors.

‘*Rightly*’—is an adverb; the sense being that the Veda imparted is
*right*, correct; not vitiated either by the omission of letters or by
wrong accent.

‘*Harm*’ stands for *injury*, and also for *disrespect*.

‘*At any time*’—*i.e*., even after the learning of books has been
accomplished, one should do him no harm. Says the author of the
*Nirukta*—‘ The Brāhmaṇas who, after being taught, do not honour their
teachers, by word, mind and act, etc., etc.’;—‘*Do not honour*,’ *i.e*.,
disregard;—‘Just as such pupils are of no use to the teacher’—bring him
no benefit—‘so also does the learning bring no benefit to the pupils.’

‘*Ātṛṇoti*’ is another reading (for ‘*āvṛṇoti*’ in the Text), which
means ‘pierces’ or ‘penetrates’ the two ears; which figuratively implies
‘teaching’; as we find in the line—‘he is called a man with
*impenetrated ears* whose ears hare not been reached by learning.’

This verse prohibits the doing of harm, by one even after he has
acquired all the learning, to all the three kinds of *Teachers*—the
Preceptor, the Sub-teacher and the Mentor.—(144)

This verse, along with verse 114, occurs in an older form (as Burnell
remarks) in the Viṣṇu and Vaśiṣṭha Smṛtis; and also in *Nirukta* II. 4,
where the verb appears as ‘*ātṛṇatti*’.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 93), which explains
‘*āvṛṇoti*’ as ‘fill’, and ‘*avitatham*’ as ‘free from wrong
accentuation and other defects’.

This verse lays down the relative superiority among the persons intended
to be eulogised. The Preceptor is superior to the Sub-teacher, the
Father is superior to the Preceptor, and the Mother is superior even to
the Father. The specification of the numbers ‘ten’ and the rest is
purely valedictory. All that is meant is that the following is superior
to the preceding; hence it is that we have the expression ‘a thousand
Fathers.’

‘*Excels ten Sub-teachers*’—*i.e*., he is superior to ten Sub-teachers.

“Why have we the Accusative ending here?”

The ‘*ati*’ (in ‘*atiricyate*’) is a preposition; the construction
being—*upādhyāyān* *ati* (in reference to Sub-teachers);—and this means
that ‘surpassing each of the ten sub-teachers, he becomes endowed with
greater honour.’ Or, the ‘*atireka*,’ *excelling* (denoted by the verb
‘*atiricyate*’), means *excess*, the verbal root being used here in the
sense of‘subjugation caused by excess’; the sense being that ‘by excess
of respect he subdues ten sub-teachers’. Lastly, if we take the verb
‘*atiricyate*’ as the reflexive passive form, the Accusative ending
becomes quite consistent; specially as the Vārtika (on Pāṇini, 3.1.87)
speaks of ‘wide usage’ in connection with such transitive verbs as
‘milk,’ ‘cook’ and the like.

*Objection*.—“The very next verse is going to assert that the ‘Father
who imparts the Veda is the superior while the present verse declares
the Father to be superior to the Preceptor: and this is mutually
contradictory.”

There is no force in this objection. According to etymologists the
“*Ācārya*’ is not one who *teaches*; hence in the present verse the term
stands for one who only performs the sacramental rites and teaches
merely the rules of conduct;—Ācārya being one who makes one learn *ā*
*cāra*. It is not necessary that one should always use only such names
as arc current in one’s own science; *e.g*., the term ‘*guru*’ in the
present treatise, has been declared to stand for the *father*, and is
also used here and then; for the *preceptor*. From all this it is clear
that the superiority of the father here meant is only over that person
who confers upon one only a slight benefit, who only performs the
Initiatory Rite and teaches the Rules of Conduct, and does not do any
teaching.

The order of precedence being as here laid down, it follows that at a
place where all these are present, the Mother is to be saluted first,
then the Father, then the Preceptor, then the Sub-teacher.—(145)

The question arising as regards the order of precedence when the real
Preceptor, and the Father who has performed the Initiatory Rite are both
present,—the next verse supplies the answer.
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The first quarter of this is referred to in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
304).

The verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 31);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 478), where the following notes are added:—In point of
veneration, the ‘*Ācārya*’ is superior as compared to ten
‘*Upādhyāyas*’, the Father is superior to a hundred *Ācāryas*, and the
Mother is superior to a thousand Fathers;—the person spoken of as
*ācārya* here is the person who performs the *Upanayana* and teaches the
*Sāvtrī* only (not the entire Veda),—as is clear from the next verse
where the man who performs the *Upanayana* and teaches the entire Veda
is described as superior to the Father.

This same explanation is given by Medhātithi and Kullūka also.
Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa on the other hand, hold that the word ‘*Pitā*’,
‘Father’, stands for that Father who, having begotten the child,
performs its *Upanayana* and himself teaches it the entire Veda.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 92), which adds
that the Father meant here is one who is a mere Progenitor and has not
performed any sacramental rites for the boy; in other eases, when he
*has* performed these, it is the Father that is superior.

‘*Progenitor*’—is one who gives natural birth; ‘*Imparter of the Veda*’
is one who teaches;—both these are ‘*fathers*’; and between these two
‘fathers,’ that Father is ‘*more venerable*’ who imparts the Veda. So
that when the Father and the Preceptor are both present, the Preceptor
should be saluted first.

The text adds a valedictory statement in support of what has been
said—‘*The Brāhmaṇa’s birth is the Veda*’; *i.e*., is for the purpose of
learning the Veda; the compound ‘*brahmajanma*’ being expounded as
‘*brahmagrahaṇārtham janma*,’ according to the *Vārtika* on ‘Pāṇini’
2.1.60. According to this explanation of the compound, the Initiatory
Rite would be ‘the birth for the learning of the Veda.’ Or, the compound
‘*brahmajanma*’ may be explained as ‘birth consisting in the form of
learning the Veda.’

This, for the Brāhmaṇa, is *eternally*—ever—*beneficial*—‘*here*’ and
‘*beneficial after death*’ also.—(110)

For the apparent inconsistency between this and the preceding verse, see
*note* above.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305), in support of
the view that the ‘*Ācārya*’ also, in certain cases, is superior to the
Father and Mother;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 32), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Brahmajanma*’ means *birth from Veda*, i. e.
*Upanayana*; ‘*after death?*—because it creates in the boy the capacity
to attain all the good, even the Final Release,—as also ‘*here*’—by
reason of creating the capacity to perform all religious rites,—it is
‘*eternally*’—the bringer about of lasting good.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 479) simply quotes the verse.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 97) in support of the view that the
orders of the Teacher carry more weight than those of the Father;—it
explains ‘*brahmadaḥ*’ as ‘the teacher’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 93), which adds that ‘*brahmadaḥ*’ stands for the
*Ācārya*, not the *Upādhyāya*, as is clear from the second line which
means—‘because he gives that *birth which serves the purpose of Vedic
study*, *i.e*. the Upanayana, he is superior.’

These two verses are purely valedictory.

‘*When the Father and. Mother beget him*’—the child—‘*through mutual
desire*’—in secret, under the influence of desire.

‘*Should be regarded as his production*;’—that the child is born in the
womb of the Mother—*i.e*., b ecomes endowed with his several limbs—this
is mere *production*. And those entities that have their *production*
are sure to be destroyed; so that what is the use of that ‘production’
which is doomed to immediate destruction?—(117)

The ‘birth’ that the Boy obtains from his Preceptor is however
indestructible. When the Veda has been got up and its meaning duly
comprehended, then alone is one enabled to perform religious acts, by
which he obtains Heaven and Final Release; and since all this is due to
the Preceptor, he is superior.

‘*That birth which the Preceptor brings about*’—*i.e*., the sacramental
rite called ‘*Upanayana*’ ‘initiation,’ which is called the ‘second
birth,’ which he accomplishes—‘*by means of the Sāvitrī*’—*i.e*., by the
expounding of it;—‘*that*’—birth—‘*imperishable, immortal*.’ Though all
these words mean the same thing, yet they have been used with a view to
pointing out that the ‘birth’ named ‘Initiation’ is superior to that
which one obtains from his mother. As a matter of fact, ‘perishing’ and
‘death’ are not possible for ‘birth,’ as they are in the case of living
beings; if mere ‘indestructibility’ were meant, this could have been
expressed by means of a single word; and yet this is not what is done
(which shows that the meaning is as explained above).

The construction of the sentence is as follows:—‘*Vedapāraga ācāryo
yāñjātim vidhivat sāvitryā*—*i.e*., by means of the full details of the
Initiatory Rite, which is what is indicated by the term
*sāvitrī—utpādayati*—is what is superior.’ ‘*Jāti*’ stands for
‘*janma*,’ birth.—(148)

That teacher who *benefits* a pupil *means of knowledge*,—‘*more or*
*less*’—this is an adverb;—‘*him also*’—who helps with a little
knowledge only—‘*one should regard as the mentor*.’

The following construction is better:—‘*yasya śrutasya*’—these are in
apposition—*i.e*., of the knowledge of the Veda, or of the Vedic
subsidiaries, or of other Sciences, or of Reasoning and Art—*alpam vahu
vā*—*tena*—this has to be supplied—*upakaroti*’ \[The meaning, by this
construction being—‘that knowledge by a little or more of which he
benefits him, etc., etc.’\]

The word ‘*śrutopakriyayā*’ is an appositional compound the apposition
being based upon the fact of the ‘knowledge’ being the means of the
‘benefit.’

What is meant by this is that the teacher referred to should be called
and treated as a ‘mentor’: just as we haver had above in the case of the
terms ‘*Ācārya*’ and the rest.—(149)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Iha*’—‘In these Institutes’ (Kullūka);—‘in the section on salutation’
(Govindarāja). It may also mean, as Buhler rightly suggests, ‘in this

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, as applying the title ‘*guru*’ to
the mere *Upādhyāya* or sub-teacher;—also in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
81);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477);—in *Aparārka* (p. 65) as
laying down that such a person deserves to be simply *respected*;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 89), to the effect that all that is meant
by such a person being called ‘*guru*’ is that ‘he deserves to be
honoured’, as is indicated by the particle ‘*api*’;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 353);—and in *Prāyaścitta-viveka* (p. 12) in support of the
view that the Father alone is not entitled to be called ‘*guru*’.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 303) quotes it as supporting the view that
the name ‘*guru*’ is applied to persons other than the Father only
figuratively or indirectly. To the same effect it is also quoted in the
same work in the Prāyaścitta section (p. 259) as describing the
*secondary ‘guru*’.

The ‘birth’ that is for the purpose of getting up the Veda is called
‘*Vedic birth*,’—*i.e*., the Initiatory Rite.—He who brings about this;
and ‘*he who teaches him his duty*—instructs him in it, by expounding
the meaning of Vedic texts,—such a Brāhmaṇa,—‘*even though he be a
child*.’—becomes tho father of the old man. That is, even though the
pupil be older in age, he should treat the teacher as his father.

*Question*.—“How can the younger man ‘initiate’ the older? Specially as
initiation is performed in the eighth year; and until one has duly
learnt and studied the Veda, he is not entitled to act up to the
injunction of ‘becoming a teacher.’”

*Answer*.—Well, in that case, we can take the term ‘*Vedic birth*’ to
mean not necessarily the Initiatory Ṛte, but only the getting up of the
Veda. *One who* ‘*brings about*’ this—*i.e*., the *Teacher*,—and ‘*he
who teaches*’—expounds—‘*him his duty*’—*i. e*., the meaning of the
Vedic texts,—‘*becomes his father*.’

‘*In law*;’—this means that the treatment of the father should be
accorded to him; so that what the phrase ‘*in law*’ means is that the
parental character of the teacher is based upon the treatment accorded
to him. The ‘treatment of the father’ has not yet been declared as to be
accorded to the teacher and the expounder; hence it has been laid down
here; in the same manner as the injunction that ‘the Kṣatriya should be
treated as the Brāhmaṇa.’—(150)

‘*Pitṛn*’—‘The Agniṣvāttas and the rest’ (Nārāyaṇa).

Burnell remarks that the sentiment here expressed, though supported by
Baudhāyana, 1. 3. 47, is opposed to Āpastamba 1.13. 15.

*Medhātithi* (p. 144, 1. 13)—‘*Arthavādoyam parakṛtināmā*’—There are
several classifications of Arthavāda passages. The one referred to here
is that into the four kinds—(1) ‘Stuti’ (2) ‘Nindā’, (3) ‘Parakṛti’ and
‘Purākalpa’—mentioned in the Nyāyasūtra of Gautama (2. 1. 65), under
which Vātsyā-yana gives examples of each kind:—(1) ‘*Stuti*’,
Valedictory—is the name given to that text which eulogises a certain
injunction by describing the desirable results following from the
enjoined act;—(2) the text that describes the undesirable results
following from the act is willed ‘*nindā*’, ‘Deprecatory—(3) the text
that describes a contrary method of action adopted by a certain person
is called ‘*parakṛti*’, ‘illustrative—and (4) that which describes a
method as adopted traditionally is called *Purākalpa*, ‘Narrative’.

Another classification of the Arthavāda is into three kinds—(1)
Descriptive by indirect implication, (2) Descriptive by direct
intimation and (3) Descriptive of an accomplished fact

The *Mīmāṃsā-bāla-prakāśa* (pp. 48-58) describes no less than 38 kinds
of Arthavāda (see Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā, pp. 115-116)

It is not by reason of his younger age that one is known as ‘child’ it
is the ‘*ignorant*’—uneducated person—who, even though old in age, is
called ‘child.’

‘*Importer of mantras*’—is used figuratively; the sense being that ‘he
who *imparts*,—*i.e*., teaches and expounds,—*the Mantras—i.e*., the
Vedas—becomes the father.’

The particle ‘*vai*,’ ‘verily,’ indicates the support of other
scriptures; and these scriptures (thus referred to) must have been
regarded by the said gods as ancient and authoritative. Hence it is that
we have the term ‘*they have called*.’ which points to a traditional
belief.

‘*The ignorant*’—uneducated—‘*person*,’—‘*they*’—*i.e*., even the
ancients—have called ‘*child*’; —*and* ‘*the importer of mantras, the
father*.’ The particle ‘*iti*,’ occurring after the term ‘*bāla*,’
points to the exact form of the traditional belief;—the construction
being—‘*ajñam bāla iti etena śabdena āhuḥ*,’ ‘the ignorant person they
have called by the name *child*.’ It is on account of the presence of
this ‘*iti*’ that the accusative ending is absent in the term ‘*bāla*.’

This story about the child (Āṅgirasa) occurs in the Chāndogya, and the
author of the *Smṛti* (Manu) has reproduced it here only in sense.—(153)

This is another eulogy of the teacher.

‘*Hāyana*’ is synonymous with ‘*samvatsara*,’ ‘years.’ One does not
become *great*—venerable—by being advanced in age by many years;—‘*nor
by grey hair*’—*i.e*., by the hairs of the head and beard becoming
white;—‘*nor by (much) wealth*’;—‘*nor by relatives*,’—does one acquire
the aforesaid title to respect. One does not become ‘great’ even by all
these taken together; but by *learning* alone. And this because ‘*the
sages have made the law*,’—‘*Ṛṣi*,’ ‘*sage*,’ is so called by reason of
his sublime vision. The meaning is that the ‘seers’ of the text and
meaning of the entire Veda, have come to the conclusion and laid down
this law—‘*he who teaches*’—‘teaching’ means instructing in the Veda
along with all its subsidiaries—‘*is the greatest*’—most
venerable—‘*among us*.’

The term ‘*made*’ stands for *laying* not for bringing into existence
what did not exist before.—(154)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Anūcānaḥ*’—‘Teacher of the Veda’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘he who
has learnt the Veda’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 480);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
93), which explains the meaning as, ‘the sages have not laid down the
principle that greatness depends on years and the rest; what they have
asserted is that among us he is great who is the best expounder of the
‘Veda.’

“This verse with the following one is proverbial, and is repeated
several times in the Mahābhārata and the other law-books.”—Hopkins.

This also is a purely commendatory description.

It has been asserted above that *knowledge* singly is superior to wealth
and other things taken together; and the same idea is re-iterated in
greater detail, in this verse.

‘*Among Brāhmaṇas*, *seniority is by knowledge*’—not by wealth, etc.

‘*Among Kṣatriyas by valour*’;—‘*va* *lour*’ stands for the ‘efficiency’
of a substance and also for ‘firmness of strength.’

‘*Among Vaiśyas by grains and riches*’;—‘*grains*’ being mentioned
separately, the term ‘*riches*’ is to be taken as signifying *gold*,
etc.; just as in the expression ‘*brāhamaṇa-pariv* *rājaka*.’ \[Where
the Brāhmaṇa being mentioned separately, the term ‘*parivrājaka*’ is
taken as standing for the renunciate of other castes.\]

The Vaiśya possessing a large quantity of wealth is regarded as senior.

The affiix ‘*tasi*’ (in the words ‘*jñānataḥ*,’ etc.) denotes cause, and
is used in accordance with Pāṇini 2.3.23.—(155)

generally cited in cases where an object whose character has become

instance, when a Brāhmaṇa has become a ‘wandering mendicant’, he is
called ‘Brāhmaṇa-mendicant’, in consideration of his past

‘*Made of wood*’;—the form of the elephant made of wood by means of the

useful purpose for the king, in the shape of killing his enemies and so

fit for anything.
