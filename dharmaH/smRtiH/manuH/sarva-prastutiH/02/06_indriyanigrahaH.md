All that the teaching means is that “one should strive to restrain his
organs”: the rest of the text is merely descriptive, up to the verse
where we have the injunction regarding the Twilight Prayers (101).

‘*Restrain*’—means the avoiding of addiction to prohibited objects and
the avoiding of excessive addiction to even those objects that are
permitted. That the prohibited tilings should be avoided we learn from
those prohibitions themselves: hence the present verse and the verses
that follow should be taken as laying down the avoiding of
over-addiction to even such things as are not prohibited.

This is what is meant by the expression—‘*roaming a many*
*objects*,’—*i.e*., in course of their natural functioning.

‘*Alluring*.’—Things that attract, draw to themselves, overpower, the
man, are called ‘alluring objects,’ those that captivate the mind.
*Roaming* among these means ‘functioning among them in manifold ways.’
If the organs did not operate among them, what could even the most
alluring objects do? Or, even if the organs were devoid of all
restraint, if the objects themselves were repellant, it would he a very
simple matter for the agent, to restrain himself. As a matter of fact,
however, both are at fault (the objects are alluring and the organs are
operative among them); hence it becomes necessary to put forth special
effort, the organs being hard to control.

‘*As the driver restrains the horses*.’—‘*Driver*’ is the *charioteer*.
Just as the charioteer puts forth special effort to coutrol the horses
that are naturally restive, and are prone to run wild along the wrong
way, and the horses become obedient to him,—in the same way one should
curb the organs to his own will.—(88)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Bālambhaṭṭi* (Vyāvahāra, p. 606).

*Medhātithi* (p. 116, 11. 11-12)—*Pariśiṣṭorthavādaḥ
āṣandhyopāsanavidhiḥ*—*i.e*. upto verse 100, all this is mere Arthavāda.
But on p. 110, he says that verse 97 contains a *vidhi*.

It is interesting to note that what Medhātithi has called Arthavāda,
Hopkins calls ‘elaborate interpolation’ (note on verse 91).

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 3.9—‘One who behaves like this keeps the senses
under control attains the regions of Brahman.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 11.4.—‘Pure, with senses under control, equipped
with fully qualified-aids.’

*Kaṭha*-*Upaniṣad*, 3.6.—‘He who is equipped with knowledge, with mind
composed, has his senses under control; just as good horses are under
ṭhe control of the charioteer.’

*Bhagavadgītā*, 2.67-68.—‘When the mind follows in the wake of the
roaming sense-organs, it deprives him of his wisdom; just as the storm
destroys the boat in water. Therefore that man whose sense-organs have
been withdrawn from the objects of sense, has his wisdom firmly
established.’

This enumeration of the organs is as laid down in other sources of
information; and the present text is not intended to lay down the number
of organs. The description is provided by our author only on account of
his good will towards his audience. The organs have been *named by the
ancient sages*; and I shall now describe their names and also their
function.

‘*In due order*.’— Implies *absence of confusion*.

The reference to the ‘*ancient sages*’ is meant to indicate that the
enumeration of the organs is not something invented by the logicians, it
was something already known among the ancient teachers. In fact, people
not knowing this are ridiculed by men as ‘not learned in the
scriptures’; hence these should be properly understood.

The meaning of the words of the text are well known, and have been
already explained.—(89)

*Sāṅkhya-sūtra, 2*. 17-20.—‘The eleven rudimentary elements are its
products;—the internal organ, along with the five organs of action and
ṭhe five organs of sensation constitute the group of eleven;—the Manas
is of the nature of both.’

*Sāṅkhya-Kārīkā* (26-27).—‘The organs of sensation are the Eye, the Ear,
the Nose, the Tongue and Skin; and speech the hands, the feet, the arms
and the reproductive organs are the organs of action.’

*Śaṅkha* (7. 25).—‘Eye, Ear, Skin, Taste, Nose should be known as the
organs of sensation in the body; the two hands, ṭhe two feet, the
reproductive organ, the tongue (organ of speech) and the arms are the
five organs of action in the body.’

*Kāmandaka* (1. 31, 33).—‘The Auditory, the Tactile, the, Visual, the
Gustatory and the Olfactory organs,—these five and the arms, the penis,
the arms, the legs and the organ of speech constitute what is called the
conglomeration of sense-organs. The soul and the mind are styled the
*internal senses*:... by the conjoint action of these two, volition is
engendered.

The *Ear* and the rest are well known. We have ‘*Eyes*’ in the Dual, in
view of the two different *substrata* (of the Visual Organ); in other
places we have the singular number in view of the fact that the
*Faculty* itself, subsisting in the said substrata, is *one* only.

The ‘*Generative Organ*,’—the organ secreting the semen (in males), and
the ovule and its receptacle (in females).

‘*Hands and feet*’—‘*Hastapādam*’;—the copulative compound has been put
in the singular number according to Pāṇini 2. 4. 2, by which copulative
compounds consisting of terras expressive of limbs of living beings are
put in the singular.

‘*Speech*’ here stands for that part of the body which consists of the
Palate and the rest, and serve to manifest sound.

The author now proceeds to describe the functions of the organs, with a
view to determine their precise nature. \[This is necessary, because\]
they are not perceptible.

‘*Organs of Sensation*’;—*i.e*., the organs productive of sensation;
they bring about effects in the form of sensations. The Genitive (in the
compound ‘*buddhīndriyāṇāṃ*’) denotes the relation of cause and effect.

‘*Beginning with the Ear, in due order*’;—the phrase ‘*in* *due order*’
has been added w ith a view to prevent the notion that the term ‘*ādi*’
signifies *kind*. “*Order*” again is in accordance with position; hence
what is meant is the order in which the organs have been mentioned in
the foregoing verse.

‘*Organs of action*’;—it is the ‘action’ of *motion* that is meant
here.—(91)

The *Mind* is what completes the number, which is the number of
sense-organs.

The ‘*own quality*’ of Mind is volition, desire; it is with the Mind
that people will or desire both what is good and what is bad. \[This is
what is meant by its being ‘*of twofold nature*’\]. Or, the Mind may be
regarded as ‘of two-fold nature’ in the sense that it partakes of the
character of both sets of organs—those of sensation as well as those of
action; as the functioning of both these sets of organs is rooted in
volition.

‘*On this being subdued*,’ both five-membered groups,—*i.e*., the group
of the organs of sensation, as well as that of the organs of action,
which have been described above,—become subdued.

That no longing for sensual objects should be entertained by reason of
the teaching of the scriptures may rest aside for the present; in fact
there is even apparent happiness proceeding from the cessation of
desires. When sensual objects are enjoyed, they only tend to produce
stronger desires. For instance, even after a man has eaten his fill,
even to the distension of the stomach, and is fully satisfied, there is
still a longing in his heart—‘why cannot I eat more?’—and it is only
through sheer inability that he does not eat more. This shows that
desire can never cease by enjoyment.

‘*Desire*’—longing.

‘*Of Desires*’—*i.e*., of things desired, longed for.

‘*Enjoyment*’—addiction to.

‘*Is appeased*’—ceases.

‘*Stronger*’—more and more..

‘*By ghṛta*’—by clarified butter.

‘*Kṛṣṇavartmā*’—Fire.

Longing is a form of pain; until one has experienced a certain taste, he
has no longing for it.

This verso only describes the true state of things. It has been thus
described—‘Whatever corns and grains, gold, cattle and women there are
on the earth are not enough to satisfy a single person;—pondering over
this, one should betake hi mself to tranquil restraint.’—(94)

The present verse formulates the conclusion deduced from th e reasons
adduced in the foregoing verses. \[The sense being\] in as much as
Desire only waxes stronger by fulfilment, hence if a pleasure-seeking
person—in the shape of a young king—‘? *hould attain*’—he addicted
to—‘*all those*’ desires;—while another person—in the shape of the
life-long celibate—‘*renounces them all*,’—*i.e*., does not touch even
the slightest thing;—between these two, the latter surpasses the
*attainer*, the enjoyer. That is, the man who renounces pleasures is
vastly superior.

This is self-evident.—(95)

“Well, if this is so, then the right course, would appear to be that one
should retire to the forest; as there will be no objects within reach;
and being beyond reach, they would naturally never be sought
after.”—With a view to such notions, the text adds that the organs
should not be subjugated by mere abstinence; as in that case the man
would have no pleasures at all, while the *Smṛti* has distinctly
declared that—‘Acquiring merit, wealth and pleasures, one should see
that his mornings, mid-days and evenings are not useless’ (*Gautama*,
9.46); and further, the continuance of the body itself would become
impossible, by total abstinence. What therefore is meant is to prohibit
excessive longing; and even though one may enjoy pleasures, this
excessive longing ceases under the influence—(*a*) of ‘*knowledge*,’ of
defects in the objects, as described in the scriptures, such for
instance as in 6.76 below,—(*b*) of one’s own experience, whereby the
said pleasures are found to be unpleasant in their consequences,—and
(*c*) of the constant and gradual practice of nonattachment arising from
the due examination of the effects of the pleasures. It is not possible
for the said longing to be renounced all at once..

‘*Ever present*’;—this qualifles ‘*knowledge*.’

‘*Contaminated*’—active, since objects are beset with defects, the
addiction to them is called ‘contamination.’

The ‘*śas*’ used here is one that is frequently used by Vyāsa, Manu and
other great sages,—in such expressions as‘*nityaśaḥ*,’ ‘*anupūrvaśaḥ*,’
‘*sarvaśaḥ*,’ ‘*pūrvaśaḥ*,’ and so forth. But exceptional efforts have
to be made in order to establish the correctness of such usage. And in
as much as the rule regarding the use of the affix ‘*śas*’ as laid down
in *Pāṇini* 5. 4. 43, is that *it is added to singular nouns, in the
sense of repetition*,—it is necessary to make the words in question
imply, somohow or other, the notion of *repetition*. Other people have
explained the expression ‘ś *as*’ as a noun formed from the root ‘*ś*
*as*’ to stand, with the affix ‘*kvip*’; and the word thus formed would
be neuter and would be treated as an adverb, the meaning being—‘*by
knowledge which is ever-standing*.’—(96)

The present verse is clearly injunctive.

‘*The Vedas*’—*i.e*., the study and recitation of them.

‘*Renunciation*’—means *charity*, figuratively; or, it may mean the
renouncing of the taking of even such meat and wine as are not
prohibited, under the impression that such abstention brings its own
reward.

He whose ‘*disposition*’—*i.e*., mind—‘*is vitiated*.’

‘*Never attain fulfilment*’—they do not bring about their due results,
at any time. From this it, follows that at the time of the performance
of the said acts, one should not allow his mind to turn towards objects
of sensuous enjoyment; for it is only thus that he may disregard all
other thoughts and concentrate his mind upon the act itself.

What this text enjoins is that one should avoid of all thought of
sensual objects,—this avoidance being a necessary accompaniment of all
acts; as in its absence the act becomes futile. The ‘vitiation of
disposition’ consists in the fact that at the time when the man is
engaged in the performance of an act, he ceases to have his mind
concentrated upon that act, and allows it to turn towards vice.—(97)

‘*Having heard*,’—such things as the sound of the flute, singing, etc.,
or such flattering words as ‘you are Bṛhaspati himself,’—‘*does not
rejoice*.’

‘*Does not grieve*’—does not suffer mental sorrow; ‘*grief*’ means
sorrow.

‘*Having touched*’;—such things as garments made of the hair of the
*Raṅku* deer, or of silk, or of the wool of sheep and goats, he touches
with equal feelings. Similarly he has exactly the same feelings in
regard to the sight of beautiful young women or of enemies; he eats with
equal feelings food cooked with plenty of butter and milk, as well as
coarse *rava* grains; he has the same feelings when smelling such things
as the oil of *Devadāru* and the oil of camphor, etc.

The man should behave so that he is not touched by mental joy or sorrow;
it is thus that his organs become subjugated; and not by mere
inactivity. So that restraint should be practised up to the said
point.—(98)

*Viṣṇu-smṛti* (96. 23).—‘While one arm is being ripped with an axe and
another is being smeared with sandal-paint,—and while, on the one hand,
he meets with prosperity, and on the other, with adversity,—he should
not mind either.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (2. 57).—‘He who has no attachment to, anything, and on
meeting with happiness, neither rejoices nbr‘is grieved, his wisdom is

\[In the term ‘*indriyāṇāṃ*’\] the Genitive has the force of
specification.

If even *one* *organ* *happens to ooze out*;—*i.e*., if on functioning
freely in regard to its object, it is not checked,—then ‘*his wisdom
oozes out*’;—*i.e*., his steadiness in regard to the other organs also
(disappears).

‘*Leathern bag*’;—a vessel for carrying water, made of the skin of the
goat and other animals. Even though all the other parts of this bag be
closed, if water trickles out of a single part of it, the whole bag
becomes empty.

In the same manner, the man’s steadiness acquired through continuous
practice of wisdom,—or even true wisdom and knowledge itself—(becomes
entirely lost). That is, being addicted to several objects, he has his
mind always turned towards them, so that the subjects dealt with by
reasonings and scriptures do not present themselves to him in the right

rightly remarks—“The hide often is used in oriental countries complete,
each leg being made water-tight.” This is indicated by Medhātithi’s
remarks also.

The present verse sums up the section.

Even though the Mind also is an ‘organ’ yet it is mentioned separately
by reason of its importance.

‘*Grama*,’ ‘*host*,’ means *group*.

Having brought under subjection the organs and the Mind, ‘*me should
accomplish*’—bring about—‘*all his purposes*’—all those results that are
accomplished by means of rites laid down in *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis*.

‘*Not injuring*’—causing pain to—his body.

‘*Yogataḥ*,’ ‘*taking care*,’—*i.e*., by careful means. This is added
with a view to such cases in which a person with delicate constitution
suffers great pain if, all on a sudden, he takes to such austere ways of
living as sleeping upon hard beds and wearing the deer-skin and so
forth. The sense is that people, who are accustomed to well-cooked and
delicious food, and to soft beds, etc., should not abandon these all at
once; they should only gradually accustom themselves to things other
than those they are accustomed to.

The term ‘*Yoga*’ may stand for well-graduated activity. In this sense
the epithet ‘*Yogataḥ* is to be construed with ‘*having* *brought under
control*.’

Or, we may construe the epithet just as it stands, the meaning being
that ‘he should have recourse to such methods as not to injure his
body.’ That is, he should not hurriedly renounce what may be necessary
for his body.

Or again, ‘*Yoga*’ may stand for *care*; and the ‘*tasi*’ affix in this
case has the sense of the instrumental; the sense being ‘he should
protect his body with care.’—(100)

‘*Yogataḥ*’—(*a*) ‘By careful means’ (construed with ‘*akṣiṇvan*’ or (
*b*) ‘gradually’ (construed with ‘*vaśekṛtvā*’)—(Medhātithi);—‘By the
practice of yoga’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 122).

*Vyāsa-ṣmrti* (4.13), (*also Vṛddha Śātātapa*, 61).—‘Having brought his
senses under control, wherever a man may live,—that place is Kurukṣetra,
Naimiṣa and Puṣkara.’

*Vyāsasmṛti* (4. 60-61).—‘One does not become heroic by obtaining
victory in battle; nor does he become learned by study; nor an orator by
mere eloquence; nor liberal by making gifts of wealth; by conquering the
organs does one become heroic; by following Dharma, learned,—by
truthfulness, an orator; and liberal, by doing good to all beings.’

*Vaśiṣṭha-smṛti* (25. 8).—‘Wisdom is attained by Yoga; Yoga is the
characteristic of Dharma; Yoga is ever the highest penance; therefore
one should be always addicted to Yoga.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (5. 28).—‘The wise man, having his senses, Manas and
Buddhi under control, having his heart fixed upon Liberation, with all
his desires, fear and auger gone,—is ever free.’

100	If he keeps all the (ten) organs as well as the mind in subjection, he may gain all his aims, without reducing his body by (the practice) of Yoga.
