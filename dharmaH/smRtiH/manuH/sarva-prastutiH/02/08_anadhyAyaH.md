<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Appurtenance*’ is that which helps; *i.e*., aids to Vedic study; the
subsidiary treatises on Kalpasūtra, Nirukta and so forth. When these are
being studied, no regard—no attention—need he paid to ‘days forbidden
for study’; similarly *with the Mantras recited during
oblations*,—holidays need not be observed; that, is, all this study
should he carried on also during the days forbidden for study.

Another reading (for ‘*anurodhaḥ*’) is ‘*nīrodhaḥ*,’ meaning
‘*cessation*’; the meaning being that even on ‘days forbidden for study’
there is no cessation of the study of what are specified in the verse.

Though it is one of the necessary conditions of the injunction of
‘study’ that there should be no study on holidays, and this injunction
pertains to the ‘study’ of ‘*Svādhyāya*,’ which is Veda,—and the
subsidiary treatises are not called ‘Veda,’—yet people might be led to
think that these latter also are interspersed with passages from the
Veda; hence the Text makes it quite clear.

Or, the ‘subsidiary treatises’ may he taken only as an instance; the
sense being that ‘just as there is no holiday in the case of the
subsidiary Treatises so is there none in the case of the Veda also.’

‘*With Mantras recited during oblations*’;—*i.e*., those Mantras that
are recited during the Agnihotra-oblations, or those recited during the
*Sāvitra* and other propitiatory oblations. All this is merely by way of
illustration. This fact, which is fully sustained by reason, is
explained here for the benefit of persons who might think that the rule
regarding the ceasing of study on holidays pertains to the uttering of
any and every Vedie passage, such as the Mantras included under the
‘*śaśvat-japa*’ and ‘*Praiṣas*,’—all which form the subject-matter of
the injunction of Vedic Study,—and might conclude that on the
*Caturdaśī* and such other holidavs, even the Mantras in connection with
oblations should not be recited. As a matter of fact, the observing of
holidays laid down in connection with Vedic Study prescribed by the
injunction of Study does not pertain to all Veda; and there are no
holidays in connection with Mantras recited during the performance of
religious rites.

‘*In connection with the daily study of the Veda*’;—*i.e*., in
connection with that study of the Veda which has been enjoined in a
preceding text as compulsory for men in all stages of life.—(105)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 149), as an
exception to the rule mentioning certain days as ‘unfit for study’;—and
the term ‘*upakaraṇa*’ is explained as *aṅgāni*, ‘the subsidiary
sciences’; and the ‘*nitya-svādhyāya*’ as that reciting of Vedic texts
which constitutes the ‘*Brahmayajña*’. The same work quotes it again (on
p. 314) as precluding the *Brahmayajña* from the scope of the rule
prohibiting the reading of Vedic texts on certain days.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (I, p. 534) as embodying an exception
to the rule regarding days unfit for study;—and again in II, p. 262 as
embodying an eulogy on *Brahmayajña*;—also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 105)
as laying down a case where the rules relating to time unfit for study
do not apply;—and also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 537), as the
foremost exception to the rules regarding days unfit for study.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 137), where ‘*vedopakaraṇa*’ is explained
as ‘*vedāṅga*’;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 141), which construes the
passage as ‘*vedopakaraṇe naityake nānadhyāyaḥ*,’ as otherwise there
would be conflict with other texts;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, pp.
148 and 162) which adds the following notes: ‘*Vedopakaraṇa*’ are the
*Vedāṅgas*—‘*nitya-svādhyāya*’ is *Brahmayajña*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 775);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 59), which supplies the same
explanation of ‘*nityasvādhyāya*’;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 338),
which explains ‘*Vedopakaraṇa*’ as the *Vedaṇgas*, and notes that the
singular number is used since the noun is treated as a *class-name*.

There is no “day forbidden for study” in regard to the daily recitation; since this has been called “Brahmasatra”; it is meritorious, being offered with the offering of study, and being maintained by the syllable “vaṣaṭ” in the shape of the recitation made on forbidden days.—(106)

This verse supplies the valedictory supplement to the foregoing
Injunction.

For the following reason, ‘*in regard to the daily recitation, there is
no day forbidden for study*,’ because ‘*it has been called
Brahmasatra*.’ That is called ‘*Satra*’ which is performed continuously;
just as the *Satra* continues to be performed for thousand years and
more without a break—and the sacrifice consisting of Vedic Study also is
a *Satra*; and because it is a *Satra*, there should he no break in it;
for if there were a break, it would cease to be ‘*Satra*.’

That the Recitation is a *Satra* is further explained by means of a
metaphor. (1) This *Satra* is offered with the offering of
‘Brahman’—*i.e*., study; just as the ordinary *Satra* is offered with
the offering of Soma. The root ‘*hu*’ in this connection stands for
*unceasing offering*, verbal roots being capable of several
significations. The term \* *Brahma*’ indicates the act of study
pertaining to the Veda. The ‘study of Brahma’ is like an ‘offering’;
this compound (‘*Brahmā-huti*’) being in accordance with Pāṇini 2.1.50.

The recitation that is done on the forbidden days supplies the place of
the syllable ‘*v* *aṣaṭ*.’ In the ordinary *Satra*, at the end of each
Yājyā-hymn tho continuity is maintained by the uttering of the syllable
‘*vaṣat*’; and in the same manner, the continuity of ‘Vedic Study’ is
maintained by the recitation that is made on the *Caturdaśī* and other
forbidden days; and this recitation therefore takes the place of the
syllable ‘*vaṣaṭ*.’

The term ‘*vaṣat*’ here indicates the syllable ‘*vauṣaṭ*.’

The *Satra* is ‘*maintained*—*i.e*.’, accomplished—by this syllable. The
compound (‘*vaṣaṭkṛtam*’) being in accordance with Pāṇini 2.1.32.—(106)

This also is supplementary to the Injunction under consideration. The
Injunction has been understood to be a compulsory one; and the mention
of results in connection with compulsory injunctions is purely
valedictory; nor do we find any Injunctive affix (in the present verse);
so that the principle enunciated in the *Mīmāṃsā Sūtra* 1.3.5 not
applying to the present case, the mention of ‘milk, curd and the rest’
could not be taken as laying down a fresh motive for another action; and
when the compulsory character of the Injunction has been ascertained,
the principle of the ‘also is not applicable; so tbat ‘milk’ and the
rest could not be regarded as of any use. For all these reasons the
passage must be regarded as a purely valedictory description; and it is
based upon the fact that one who studies the Veda regularly becomes
famous among people, and hence becoming the recipient of gifts of
cattle, be naturally obtains large quantities of milk, etc.

‘*Svādhyāya*’—Veda;—‘*udhīte*’—recites;—‘for one year’—for one full year
;—‘*in due form*,’—*i.e*., seated upon Kuśa-grass with its tips pointing
eastwards;—‘*self-controlled*,’—*i.e*., with the organs under bis full
control;—‘*clean*’—by means of bathing, etc.,; ‘*for him*’—for that
man;—‘*constantly*’—as long as he lives;—‘*pours out*’—makes to flow,
supplies;—‘*this*’—recitation;—‘*milk*, *curd*, *etc*.’

Others hold that the terms ‘*payaḥ*’ (‘milk’) and the rest stand
respectively for Merit, Worldly Prosperity, Pleasure and Pinal
Liberation. Merit is called ‘milk’ because the two are similar in the
point of purity; Worldly Prosperity is called ‘curd,’ because it
resembles the latter in being a source of strengthening the body;
Pleasure is called ‘clarified butter,’ because of the resemblance
consisting in both containing ‘*Sneha*’ (smoothness); Pinal Liberation
is called ‘honey’ because it combines in one all flavours. The meaning
thus is that all the purposes of man are accomplished in a single year,
what to say of the study being continued for a longer time!

As the whole passage is purely valedictory, we need not be very
particular as to what is the right signification of the terms ‘milk’ and
the rest.—(107)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Payo dadhi ghṛtam madhu*’—stand respectively for Merit, Wealth,
Pleasure and Final Release, according to Nārāyaṇa and Nandana.
Medhātithi notes this explanation as provided by ‘others.’

*Medhātithi* (p. 124, 1. 15)—‘*Ekasya tūhhayatve*’—This is Mīmāṃsā Sūtra
4. 3. 4. There are two texts—‘makes an offering of curd’ and ‘for the
benefit of one desiring sense-organs, one should sacrifice with curd’;
the question that arises is whether these two texts lay down two
distinct acts, or both conjointly enjoin a single act; and the
conclusion is that the two acts are distinct.

This principle, Medhātithi argues, is not applicable to the present
case; the mention of the four distinct substances cannot he taken as
supplying the motive for four distinct acts.

*Medhātithi* (p. 124,1. 16)—‘*Rātrisatranyāyaḥ*’—This is enunciated in
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 4. 3. 17 *et seq*. In connection with the *Rātrisatra*
sacrifice, it has been held that it is conducive to ‘respectability,’
even though this is a result mentioned in an Arthavāda passage. This
principle also is not applicable to the present case where the necessary
motive is provided by the compulsory character of the act.
