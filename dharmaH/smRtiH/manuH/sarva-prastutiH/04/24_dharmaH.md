<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If one is unable to bestow a large gift, or perform a difficult
austerity, or offer an elaborate sacrifice—like the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest,—he should not he despondent on that account; on the contrary, he
should ‘*slowly*’ and gently ‘accumulate spiritual merit,’ by means of
small gifts, small austerities, by helping others, to the best of his
ability, and by muttering prayers and offering oblations prescribed in
the *Smṛtis*; just in the same manner in which white ants accumulate the
*ant-hill*.

‘*For the purpose of obtaining a companion in the other world*.’—This
describes the fruits of spiritual merit.

‘*Without causing pain to any beings*;’ *i.e*., even for the sake of
spiritual merit, he shall not go about begging and thereby causing pain
to others.—(238)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 232), which reads ‘*vaprikāḥ*’
for ‘*puttikāḥ*’, and explains it as ‘a particular kind of art’;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 64), which explains ‘*puttikā*’ as ‘a
kind of art’; and explains that this and the following verses are meant
to eulogise *Dharma*.

Alone is a creature born, and alone does it cease to be; alone it enjoys its good deeds and also its evil deeds.—(239)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Each creature*’—living being—‘*is born alone*,’—and not along with his
friends and relations; and ‘*alone does it cease* *to be*;’ friends and
relations do not die with him. Even when one’s wife, or some other
devoted person, kills herself at the time of one’s death, this act of
*dying* is different from that of the man’s own dying; and, by this act,
the wife does not become born in the same womb with the husband, in the
way in which Atri was born.

Similarly, his good and evil deeds also the man enjoys himself.

“It has been said that neither one’s wife nor one’s sons help him; hut,
as a matter of fact, the son does help the father, by performing the
*śrāddha* and other rites; and so the wife also.”

True; but all that this mentis is that such a dutiful son is horn only
to a person who has acquired merit; and, just as during life, one is
helped by another person who supports him by the hand, so also, when the
man dies, his son helps him by means of religious acts.—(240)

their backs upon it and go away. Therefore, O king, it is Righteousness

‘*Dharmapradhānam*’—means ‘he for whom Duly is the main consideration’;
*i.e*., he who is devoted to duty, and perforins all acts exactly as
they are enjoined.

‘*Who has his sins destroyed by austerities*.’—If he happens to commit
any transgressions, through carelessness, his sin is destroyed by the
expiatory austerities he performs. The evil having arisen out of his
transgression of the law, it is effaced by the proper expiatory rites.

‘*It carries him to the brighter regions above*,’—*i.e*., the effulgent
regions of the gods, in the shape of Heaven, etc.

Who carries him?

*Dharma*, or Spiritual Merit. That this is so, is clear from the
context.

‘*Clothed in his own body*.’—The Soul being in *its own body*, and not
in the body made up of material substances, as ordinary souls are, his
body is his own spiritual one; which means that he is us all-pervading
us Brahman, the Supreme Spirit.—(243)
