He shall always diliqenty perform, with faith, sacrifices and other religious acts; done with faith, and with well-begotten wealth, they become imperishable.—(226)


Of these, learning and austerities are the sources that bring presents. Though ‘present’ constitutes only one kind of wealth, yet it has been mentioned as two, on account of its twofold source. The qualifications of the persons making the gifts have also to be borne in mind. If the giver does not happen to be absolutely objectionable, the wealth derived from him is also pure.—The terms ‘person sacrificed for’ and ‘pupil’ indicate the work of officiating at sacrifices and teaching.—‘inherited,’ from one’s forefathers.—‘Bride,’ what is obtained from the Father-in-law, at the time of marriage.—‘Bravery’— for the Kṣatriya; while the ‘bride’ and ‘inheritance,’ are common to all men.


‘Service’ consists of running on errands and obeying orders; while ‘attendance’ is agreeable behaviour. Of these, ‘usury,’ ‘agriculture’ and ‘trade’ are mixed only for the non - Vaiśya; for the Vaiśya, these are commendable. Similarly, ‘service,’ consisting of attending upon twice-born men, is commendable for the Śūdra; the others are not commended for him. What is meant by these being ‘mixed’ is, that the results obtained from acts, performed with wealth derived from those sources, are transitory; these results lasting only during the present life.


‘Pārśvika,’—the man at one’s side, obtains wealth by means of bribery, etc. For instance, having come to know that a person is going to obtain some wealth, one goes over to him and says, ‘I shall get yon so much wealth, you should give me something out of it,’ and then receives it from him; the man not having done anything himself, nor having anything done by others, but simply looking on, and yet receiving money; or when one receives some consideration for standing surety for a borrower.—‘Pratirūpaka’ is pretence, hypocrisy .—‘Fraud’—when one sells the kusumbha flower, in place of saffron.—‘Ārti’ is causing pain to others.—‘Stealing’ is taking away things by stealth; and ‘robbery’ is taking away by force.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Iṣṭa*,’ ‘*sacrifice*,’ stands for those acts of Sacrifice and the like
that are done on a regular altar; while ‘*pūrta*’ stands for other acts
done with a view to spiritual results, such as honouring those who
deserve to be honoured, and so forth.

Both these sets of acts shall be done ‘*with faith*;’ and *with
well-gotten wealth*;’—*i.e*., with wealth got by such fair means as
learning, bravery, bride, and so forth.

Thus performed, these acts lead to ini perishable results. Those that
are performed with wealth not well-gotten, are not fruitless; they only
lead to perishable (transitory) results. Because, even unfair means
produce *ownership*; so that sacrifices may be performed with wealth
over which one’s ownership has been produced. Further, *usury* (as a
means of acquiring wealth) is not found to have been prohibited anywhere
in connection with sacrifices and charities. Hence it follows that, even
with the help of such wealth, sacrifices, etc., shall be performed till
Heaven has been attained. There will certainly be some difference in the
degr.ee of excellence in the results obtained.

Now, the question arises—What are the *fair* sources of acquiring
wealth?

In answer to this, we have the following verses:—

I. *What is derived from* (*a*) *learning*, (*b*) *bravery*, (*c*)
*austerities*, (*d*) *bride*, (*e*) *person sacrificed for*, (*f*)
*pupil, and* (g) *inheritance,—are the seven kinds of ‘pure*’ *wealth;
and the result of these is also pure*.

> Of these, *learning* and *austerities* are the sources that bring
> presents. Though ‘present’ constitutes only one kind of wealth, yet it
> has been mentioned as *two*, on account of its twofold source. The
> qualifications of the persons making the gifts have also to be borne
> in mind. If the giver does not happen to be absolutely objectionable,
> the wealth derived from him is also *pure*.—The terms ‘*person
> sacrificed for*’ and ‘*pupil*’ indicate the work of *officiating at
> sacrifices* and *teaching*.—‘*inherited*,’ from one’s
> forefathers.—‘*Bride*,’ what is obtained from the Father-in-law, at
> the time of marriage.—‘*Bravery*’— for the *Kṣatriya*; while the
> ‘bride’ and ‘inheritance,’ are common to all men.

II\. *What is derived by*— (*a*) *usury*—(*b*) *agriculture*, (*c*)
*trade*, (*d*) *art* (*e*) *service*, (*f*) *attendance*, *and* (*g*)
*from a person who has been helped* ;—*these seven kinds of wealth are
called* ‘*mixed*.’

> ‘*Service*’ consists of running on errands and obeying orders; while
> ‘*attendance*’ is agreeable behaviour. Of these, ‘usury,’
> ‘agriculture’ and ‘trade’ are *mixed* only for the *non* - *Vaiśya*;
> for the *Vaiśya*, these are commendable. Similarly, ‘service,’
> consisting of attending upon twice-born men, is commendable for the
> *Śūdra*; the others are not commended for him. What is meant by these
> being ‘mixed’ is, that the results obtained from acts, performed with
> wealth derived from those sources, are transitory; these results
> lasting only during the present life.

III\. *What is obtained by*—(*a*) *bribery*, (*b*) *gambling*, (*c*)
*stealing*, (*d*) *causing pain to others*, (*e*) *hypocrisy*, (*f*)
*robbery and* (*g*) *fraud*;—*all this has been declared to be ‘black*.’

> ‘*Pārśvika*,’—the man at one’s side, obtains wealth by means of
> bribery, etc. For instance, having come to know that a person is going
> to obtain some wealth, one goes over to him and says, ‘I shall get yon
> so much wealth, you should give me something out of it,’ and then
> receives it from him; the man not having done anything himself, nor
> having anything done by others, but simply looking on, and yet
> receiving money; or when one receives some consideration for standing
> surety for a borrower.—‘*Pratirūpaka*’ is pretence, hypocrisy
> .—‘*Fraud*’—when one sells the *kusumbha* flower, in place of
> saffron.—‘*Ārti*’ is causing pain to others.—‘*Stealing*’ is taking
> away things by stealth; and ‘*robbery*’ is taking away by force.

“As a matter of fact, stealing and robbery do not produce *ownership* at
all, these not having been mentioned, among the means of acquiring it,
in Gautama 10.39—‘One becomes an owner by inheritance, purchase,
partition, presents and trade;’ or, in Manu (10.116)—‘Learning, Art,
Service,’ etc; or, again, Manu (10.115)—‘Seven sources of wealth are
legal, etc.’ If it be argued that these same assertions indicate Theft
and Robbery also as sources of wealth—then, what would be the meaning of
the assertion—‘What is eaten by force, cannot be digested.’”

Some people offer the following explanation:—‘*Dyūta-cauryārti*’
(Gambling, Theft, Causing pain to others) is not the right reading; the
right reading being ‘*vairyārti*’ (enmity, causing pain). At the time of
making peace with an enemy, one says, ‘I shall make peace with yon only
if you give me so much;’ and the other party, being helpless, gives what
is asked for,—The term, *sāhasa*, does not stand for *robbery*, but for
*rashness*; when, for instance, one earns wealth even at the risk of
one’s life; *e.g*., by going on boats, or by selling things prohibited
by the king.

Others, however, opine as follows:—‘Ownership’ by robbery is not
incompatible with the assertion regarding ‘not digesting;’ because force
is employed only at the first act of snatching, and, after that, even
when there is no force used, and the wealth is obtained and enjoyed
merely by the indifference of the other party, there does come about
actual *ownership* And, as for the assertion that it is not digested,
this refers to the case where voilence (violence?) is used from
beginning to end. Thus there is no incompatability between the two.

The right view on this point is as follows:—Real ownership is not
brought about by Theft and Robbery, because of the different reading
suggested; and also because other Smṛti-writers have not mentioned these
among the.means of acquiring weath.—(226)

*Baudhāyana* (1.5.62, 64).—‘The gods, ever bent upon purity, loath the
offerings of the faithless, and never accept them. In connection with
this they quote the following—Faithlessness is the worst sin, Faith is
the highest penance; therefore the gods do not eat what is offered
without faith.’

*Mahābhārata* (Śānti., 270. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21).—‘An
action involving injury to living beings destroys faith here as also
elsewhere; and O Brahman, Faith, being destroyed, destroys the man.—A
sacrifice is a sacrifice only when it is performed by men who are calm,
imbued with faith, self-controlled and high-minded, not otherwise.—One
should eat food offered by the generous man, never that offered by the
miser or the woman.—The faithless man does not deserve to make offerings
to gods; his food should never be eaten; so have declared persons versed
in law.—Faithlessness is the worst sin; Faith is destructive of sin; the
man imbued with faith casts off sin, just as the serpent casts off its
skin, etc.’

*Mahābhārata* (Aparārka, p. 290).—‘The one-fìre Rite, the offerings into
the three fires, the gifts given within the altar—these are called
*Iṣṭa*. Wells, tanks, ponds, temples, food-stalls, public gardens—the
building of these is called *Pūrta*.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—‘Receiving guests and Vaiśvadeva-offerings are called
Iṣṭa. Tanks, ponds, temples, food-stalls, gardens, gifts made during
eclipses, and on the day of the sun passing from one sign into another,
and on the twelfth day of the fortnight,—these constitute *Pūrta*.’

not used either in charity, or in enjoyment, or in acquiring fame, or in
acquiring spiritual merit,—that wealth is absolutely useless. Therefore,
after having acquired wealth, either through fate or by his own efforts,

‘*Something*’—however little—shall be given by one who is ‘*asked*,’
begged. If there is some doubt,—and no certainty—as to the person being
a worthy or unworthy recipient, some little thing, not much, should be
given. The idea, that much shall not be given, is due to a direct
assertion to that effect, in connection with doubtful cases.

It is just possible that the man may turn out to be a worthy
recipient;—What sort of recipient?—‘*One who will save him from*’—guard
him against—‘*everything*’—all kinds of Sin that lead men to hell.

It has been said under 3.96 that gifts are to be offered to ‘one who
knows the Veda and its meaning;’ and to that the present verse is an
exception, providing for small gifts being offered in cases of doubtful
worthiness of the recipient.—(228)

enjoyment fulfilled;—by the giving of lamp-light, the man obtains good
eyes and keen intelligence.’

*Viṣṇu* (91.3, 15, 16).—‘The giver of water remains ever satisfied;—by
the giving of lamps, he obtains excellent eyes and universal brilliance;
by the giving of food, he becomes endowed with strength.’

*Viṣṇu* (92.21, 23).—‘The giver of food obtains all things;—the giver of
sesamum obtains desirable offspring.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1, 210).—‘By giving away, land, sesamum, food, clothes,
water, clarified butter, shelter, household-necessaries, gold and beasts
of burden,—one shines in the heavenly regions.’

*Bṛhaspati* (13).—‘The giver of food is always happy, the giver of
clothes becomes endowed with beauty, and the man who gives land is
always a king.’

He comes to look like—just as pleasing to look at as—the Moon. According
to the Purāṇas, the meaning would be that he reaches that particular
region in Heaven which is called the ‘Region of the Moon.’

‘*Resemblance to horse-owners*;’—*i.e*., he obtains many horses.
According to the Purāṇa,—‘he obtains the region of the Ashwins.’

‘*Ox*’ is the male animal, capable of pulling carts; he who gives this,
obtains ‘*great good fortune*’;—*i.e*., acquires excellent cattle,
sheep, riches and grain.

‘*Bradhna*’ is the *Sun*; he obtains the region of the Sun; *i.e*., he
becomes endowed with great effulgence, superior to everything else. Or,
the ‘*region* *of* *the Sun*’ may stand for Heaven.

Another Smṛti-text (Yājñavalkya, Achara, 204) describes special results
arising from the giving of particular kinds of cows:—‘A milch cow, with
golden horns and silvered hoofs, quiet and covered with cloth, shall be
given, along with a *kāṃsya* vessel, accompanied with a proper fee.’ If
we read ‘*sa-dakṣiṇā*,’ the meaning will be that gold and other things
shall be given as additional gifts. Or, we may read ‘*su*’ for ‘*sa*’
(*i*. *e., ‘sudaksiṇā*),’ meaning *beautiful*; the meaning being that
the cow given, as also the presents, shall be
*excellent*.—‘*kāṃsyopadohā* is another reading for ‘*sakāṃsyapatra*;’
‘*kāṃsya*’ standing for a particular measure; and the cow should give
that much milk; *i.e*., she should give a large quantity of milk.

Further details of procedure have been laid down in other texts; such
as—‘Her tail shall be adorned with pearls, the ground shall be covered
with silver,’ and so forth; and these have to be observed by men
desiring special results; as described in the text—‘The tawny cow with
calf saves

one’s forefathers up to the seventh degree, and the double-faced cow
(one just giving birth to a calf) for the same number of cycles as there
are hairs on her body. The result here mentioned follows from the giving
of the tawny cow; the double-faced cow, when given, leads to Heaven, for
as many ‘thousand years’ as there are hairs on her body;—‘saves’ stands
for *freeing from sin*.

In the Mahābhārata, the giving of the cow has been describes as bringing
all kinds of rewards.

The giving of water, etc., also is found mentioned as bringing all kinds
of rewards—‘Having given land, cattle, food, clothes, water, sesamum,
butter, shelter, houses and gold—one shines in Heaven.’ ‘*Naiveśika*’
means *House*.—(231)

The tern ‘*bhāva*,’ ‘*spirit*,’ denotes *mental disposition*. In
whatever spirit—with a pleasant mind, proper faith and respect—one
bestows a gift, in that same spirit he himself obtains it; if, on the
other hand, he gives without faith, in a disrespectful manner and after
having insulted the recipient,—then he himself also obtains it in the
same manner.

The phrase, ‘*yadyat*,’ ‘*whatever*,’ does not refer to the *kinds of
things* (given as gifts).—“What, then, is the use of the
expression?”—The explanation is that the phrase means that ‘the man
obtains the pleasures brought about by the substances concerned.’ If the
objects themselves were meant, then, in the case of a man giving
medicines to a sick person, he would obtain (as reward) that same
medicine; and, since such a reward would be of no use to a healthy
person, it would be thrown away. For this reason, the meaning must be
that ‘the giver obtains the same kind of pleasure that he causes by his
gift;’ so that the gift of medicines would bring sound health to the
giver.

Or, the term ‘*bhāva*’, ‘*spirit*,’ may stand for *desire, purpose*, the
idea ‘may this be mine;’ the sense of the passage in that case would
be—‘the man obtains that same reward, with a view to obtaining which he
bestows the gift,’—and that ‘*in the same spirit*;’ *i.e*., he obtains
it at the same time at winch he happens to be in want of it. This
implies that the gift of all things may bring to the giver all kinds of
rewards.—(234)

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 17), which, explains
‘*bhāva*’ as standing for the predominance of one or other of the three
*guṇas*, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.

Gifts should he bestowed with respect; they should be received also in

‘*Arcitam*,’ ‘*respectfully*,’ is an adverb.—(235)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 290);—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p.

the receiver receives it with respect,—both go to heaven; while by
giving or receiving with disrespect, both go to hell’—such is the
explanation given by Kullūka Bhaṭṭa. Thus the ‘*arcā*’, ‘respect’, which
appears as an adverb, serves as an adjective also, qualifying the men
concerned; it is for this reason that *Maithila* writers have declared
that gifts should be made after the object to be given as well as the
Brāhmaṇa receiving it have both been worshipped;—and in

He shall not be proud of his austerities; having offered a sacrifice, he shall not utter a lie; even when tormented, he shall not revile the brāhmaṇas; having bestowed a gift, he shall not advertise it.—(236)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When he performs an austerity, he shall not boast of it,—‘I have
performed a most severe austerity, extremely difficult to perform;’ he
shall not entertain any such idea.

‘*Having performed a sacrifice, he shall not utter a lie*.’—Though
*lying* in general has been forbidden, in connection with what is
desirable for men, yet it is forbidden again, with a view to indicate
that the avoidance of untruth is an essential factor in sacrifices also;
and that, if there is a transgression of this, the performance of the
*Jyotiṣṭoma*, etc., would become defective.

‘*Tormented*’— by the Brāhmaṇas—‘*he shall not revile*’—abuse, speak ill
of—them.

‘*Having bestowed a gift*’— in the form of the cow and such other
things,—‘*he shall not advertise it*’ before another person, saying,
‘Such and such a gift has been bestowed by me.’—(236)

236	Let him not be proud of his austerities; let him not utter a falsehood after he has offered a sacrifice; let him not speak ill of Brahmanas, though he be tormented (by them); when he has bestowed (a gift), let him not boast of it.

The sacrifice trickles away by falsehood, the austerity trickles away by vanity, longevity by the reviling of Brāhmaṇas, and gifts by advertisement.—(237)

This is supplementary to the foregoing Prohibition. By reason of
‘falsehood,’ ‘*the sacrifice trickles away*’—*i e*., becomes fruitless;
the purpose for which it was performed is not accomplished. Similarly,
throughout the verse.—(237)

237	By falsehood a sacrifice becomes vain, by self-complacency (the reward for) austerities is lost, longevity by speaking evil of Brahmanas, and (the reward of) a gift by boasting.
