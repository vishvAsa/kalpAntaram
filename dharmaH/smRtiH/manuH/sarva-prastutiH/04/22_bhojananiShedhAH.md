<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The preceding verse has closed the section on Positive Duties; now
begins the section on prohibitions (Negative Duties).

Among the various acts it is that of eating which is likely to be done
at random,—food being what is sought after most; hence the text proceeds
with prohibitions regarding the act of eating.

‘*Aśrotriya*,’ ‘*Non-śrotriya*,’ is *one who has not learnt the Veda*;
at the sacrifice ‘*performed*’—undertaken—by him,—or at sacrifice at
which the officiating priests are ignorant of the *Veda*—‘*the Brāhmaṇa
shall not eat*.’

‘*Village-priest*,’—one who officiates as the priest of the entire
village; where such a person, or a woman, offers the sacrifice.

In the *Chāndogya*, the authors of the *Gṛhya* -rules have described the
performance of sacrifices by women, and it is in view of this that the
text forbids eating at such sacrifices. Or, the prohibition may refer to
that sacrifice at which the woman is the principal performer; her
husband being beset with poverty and other disqualifications, and the
woman being proud of the wealth acquired by her as dowry, or of the
wealth possessed by her relations.

‘*Eunuch*’— wanting in masculinity.—(205)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
944);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 494), which explains
‘*aśrotriyatate*’ as ‘that which is performed by such priests or
sacrifices as are devoid of Vedic learning’; this prohibition must mean
that one should not eat at such a sacrifice, even *after
Agniṣomīya-Vapāyāga*; as regards the time before this, eating at a
sacrifice is already forbidden by the general rule that ‘one should not
eat the food belonging to one who has been initiated for a sacrificial
performance’;—‘*grāmayājin*’ is one who performs sacrifices for groups
of men; and one should not eat at a sacrifice where such a priest makes
the offerings;—nor should one eat at a house where *Vaiśvadeva* and
other offerings have been made by a woman; this must be taken as
applying to cases where such priests are available, for where they are
not available, even women fire permitted to make the
offerings;—‘*klība*’ is ‘impotent’.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 770);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 259), which adds the following notes—‘*aśrotrīya*’, one who has not
learnt the Veda,—‘*grāmayājī*’, one who officiates as priest at the
Śrāddha and other performances by several persons, or performs
propitiatory rites for others; one should not go to a sacrifice where
such a man happens to be the *Hotṛ*, priest.

The food offered by such persons is to be avoided, so long as the
intoxication and other conditions are actually on them.

Others explain the text to refer to habit; the sense being that one
should avoid the food offered by such persons as are frequently
drunk,—who are habitual drunkards.

Similarly, with one who has bad temper and is frequently obssessed by
rage; or one who is mostly sick, a confirmed invalid.

‘*What is contaminated by*’—spoilt by the touch of—‘*hair and insect*.’
Among insects, there are some which contaminate the food by their
presence when they are dead; *e.g*., flies and lizards; while others
spoil it even when living.

The term ‘*insect*’ includes all small creatures, such as worms, flies,
etc. And ‘*hair*’ includes nails and bristles, as also dirt and other
things;—on the basis of usage.

‘*What is touched with the foot intentionally*;’—there is no harm if it
is touched simply through chance carelessness—(207).

which explains ‘*mattaḥ*’ as ‘intoxicated, either by wine or by wealth
etc.’—and ‘*āturaḥ*’ as ‘afflicted with a very serious disease.’

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451), which explains
‘*Keśakītāvapanna*’ as ‘defiled by the presence of hair or insects’;—and
‘*Kāmataḥ*’ as ‘intentionally’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 517),
which adds that since the text has added the qualification ‘*Kāmataḥ*’,
there should be no harm if the food happens to be touched by the foot
*unintentionally*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 610 and 770);—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 296);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which

‘*Bhrūnahā*’ is the *Brāhmaṇa-slayer*; what has been ‘*looked
at*’—eagerly seen—by such a person. This is only illustrative; it
indicates other sinful persons also. The prohibition of food *touched*
by these persons follows from the rule that lays down the necessity of
bathing on being touched by such sinners.

‘*Udakyā*’ is the woman in her courses; and what is forbidden is food
*touched*—not merely *seen*—by her.

“As a matter of fact, the Text is going to lay down the necessity of
bathing on touching a woman in her courses; this alone being sufficient
to indicate her impurity, how could there be any possibility of any one
taking the food touched by her (that the Author should have found it
necessary to forbid it)?”

Our answer to this is as follows:—\[ This prohibition was thought
necessary, because \] in the first place, people might be led to eat
food touched by her after having washed it; or secondly, in view of what
has been said regarding the mention of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa-slayer*’ being
illustrative, some one might be led to believe that this latter term is
indicative of all those that are mentioned in verse 5.85; and, in that
case, the prohibition would apply to the food even *seen* by the woman
in her courses.

This same explanation applies to the prohibition of ‘*what has been
touched by a dog*.’

It has been said that the term ‘*Brāhmaṇa-slayer*’ is indicative of
other sinful outcasts also; and what are thus included are the
‘outcast,’ ‘the newly-delivered woman’ and others mentioned later on (in
5.85); and the ‘woman in her courses.’ also includes the newly-delivered
woman.

‘*Patatri*’ is bird; and the birds meant are the carnivorous ones, the
vulture, *etc*., and not the swan and other non-carnivorous ones; such
being the usage among men.—(208)

‘*Food publicly offered*,’—the food that is given at temples or
sacrificial sessions, by public notice, to all coiners, without any
invitation to individuals. Or, it may mean ‘what is given to one person
after having been promised to another.’

The root, ‘*Ghuṣ*’ has been declared to mean *to announce*; so that
people regard the present verse as refering to cases where there is no
announcement; and what is forbidden, therefore, is eating, *without
invitation*, at sacrifices, marriages and such other functions.

The ‘*gaṇa*,’ meant by the text is *multitude*, *company*; hence the
name is not applied to a number of brothers living together undivided.
It is declared in Discourse IX that ‘there is a single duty operating
among brothers living jointly’; and the duty therein referred to is the
*receiving of guests*, and so forth; all which is made clear under
9.105, where the ‘eldest brother’ is declared as inheriting the entire
parental property; and it is this inheritance that indicates his
liability to fulfil the duties also.

What is forbidden is what is not induced in the parental heritage, even
though it belong in common to all.

‘*Harlot*’ is the public woman.

‘*Censured*’— deprecated,—‘*by the learned*’,—even though it be
something edible; *e.g*., the lotus-stalk, the oil-cake, and so
forth.—(209)

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290).

The verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451), which explains
‘*ghuṣṭānnam*’ as ‘the food that is offered at sacrificial sessions and
other similar occasions, to all and sundry by public proclamation’;—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 495), which explains ‘*ghuṣṭānna*’ in the
same manner as *Smṛtitattva*, but quotes Medhātithi’s second alternative
explanation of it as ‘what had been previously promised to another
person’; ‘*viśeṣataḥ*’ has been added with a view to indicate the
exceptional objectionability of the food;—‘*gaṇa*’ is ‘multitude,’—this
term is not applicable to brothers who have not separated;—‘*gaṇikā*’ is
a ‘prostitute’;—‘what has been condemned by a disinterested person
learned in the Veda, even without his detecting any of the specified
defects.’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 510 and 771);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which adds the following notes:
—‘*Ghuṣṭānnam*’, that food which is offered publicly with such words as
‘who is there who will take this food?’,—‘*gaṇānnam*’ food cooked by
several persons jointly.

‘*Singer*,’— Who lives by singing. The ordinary occasional singing of
popular songs is actually laid down.

‘*Miser*’— niggard.

The difference between the ‘prisoner’ and the ‘fettered’ is, that the
former may be imprisoned by mere words (verbal orders), while the latter
is actually bound in ropes and iron-chains.

Some people read ‘*viśadasya*’ for ‘*nigadasya*;’—‘*viśaḍa*’ being
explained as ‘man in trouble.’—(210)

‘*Baddhasya nigaḍasya*;’—‘One who is only verbally confined *and* one
who is bound with cords or iron chains’ (Medhātithi);—‘one *bound with

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
944);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 495)

belongs to another,’—‘*gāyana*’ is ‘one who makes a living by
singing,’—‘*takṣan*’ is ‘one who has carpentery for his livelihood,’—and
‘*Vārdhuṣika*’ is ‘one who makes a living by charging improper rates of
interest, or by making undue profits by trade; and adds that the term is
also applied to one who brags of his own superior virtues and decries
others’—this on the strength of a text quoted from Viṣṇu;—‘*dīkṣita*’ is
‘one who has been consecrated by means of the *Dīkṣaṇīya-Iṣṭi*,’—whose
food should not be eaten prior to the ceremony of purchasing the Soma,
or before the *Agnīṣomīya vapāyāga*;—‘*kadarya*’ is ‘the miser,’ defined
by Devala as ‘one who, through greed for amassing wealth, causes
suffering to himself, his wife and children, as also hinders the right
fulfilment of his religious duties’;—‘*baddhasya*’ means ‘bound with
ropes,’ or ‘bound only verbally,’—and ‘*nigaḍasya*’ means ‘one who is
*in chains*’; though ‘*nigaḍa*’ means ‘chains’ only, yet it stands here
for one who is *in chains*; \[this is as Medhātithi has explained the
terms\]; or the genitive in ‘*nigaḍasya*’ may be taken in the sense of
the instrumental, so that, the two words ‘*baddhasya nigaḍasya*’ may be
taken together as ‘*nigadena baddhasya*’ (one bound in chains);—this
according to *Kalpataru*.

This is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 710);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which defines ‘*Vārdhuṣika*’ according to
Yama as ‘one who buys things cheap, and sells them dear, as also one who
makes a living by lending money on interest’; and explains ‘*dīkṣitaḥ*’
as ‘the person who has performed the *Dīkṣaṇīya Iṣṭi*’; his food is
forbidden till the end of the sacrifice in connection with which that
Iṣṭi has been performed,—and ‘*kadarya*’as ‘he who amasses wealth at the
cost of much discomfort to himself, his religious performances, his wife
and children;—‘*baddhasya*,’ one who is tied with a rope,—‘*nigaḍa*,’
chain.

     The ascription of this passage to Āpastamba is curious. It is from the well-known passage of Baudhāyana on the unique practices of the north and the south. Either Medh has made a mistake here, or the medieval editor for King Madana made a mistake here.

‘*Unchaste woman*’—one who has sexual intercourse with any and every
person.

“The food of the harlot has been already forbidden \[so that the present
text would appear to be superfluous\].”

It is not so; the ‘unchaste woman’ is totally different from the
‘harlot.’ The ‘harlot’ is one that makes a living by her beauty; while
the ‘unchaste woman’ is one who is unstable in her sexual passions.

‘*Hypocrite*’—the ‘man of cat-like behaviour’ and others of similar bad
conduct.

‘*The Śūdra’s leavings*’ are specially forbidden here for the purpose of
indicating the heaviness of the expiatory panance necessitated by
it;—the partaking of the leavings of all men having been already
forbidden.

Others explain the terms, ‘*Śūdra’s leavings*,’ to mean the food *left
in the dish*, after the *Śūdra* has eaten out of it.

Another reading is ‘*ucchiṣṭamagurostathā*,’ ‘the leavings of persons
other than one’s teacher.’

As a matter of fact, the term ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ stands for that which has
been defiled by the touch of another person, as also for that which has
been left after another person has eaten. In the latter sense, if one’s
own ‘leavings’ were prohibited, then every one would have to cat the
whole of one’s food as a single morsel. Nor is it the custom among
cultured people that, after having eaten one morsel of food, the man
washes his hands and mouth and eats the next morsel out of another dish.
As for the prohibition that ‘one Should not cat the food once partaken
of,’ what this forbids is the interruption of the meal by such acts as
rising to receive a guest, and so forth, till one has had one’s fill and
till one has washed; after which the touch of others involves no harm.

Where several persons are dining together, even if they happen to touch
one another,—as this touching is something totally different,—it would
not be a case of ‘eating the leavings.’ As a matter of fact, the Father,
along with his sons, always partakes of the food *left* by guests.
Āpastamba and others have deprecated eating *with uninitiated sons*,—not
with the *initiated* ones.

According to this view, the prohibition would apply to eating in the
company of men of other castes; and, in all such cases, some intervening
screen shall he set up between the two persons. As for ‘leavings,’ in
the sense of what has been left after one has eaten,—this is forbidden,
whether it be one’s own ‘leavings’ or those of some other person,—(211).

‘*Śūdrasyocchiṣṭam*’—‘Food of a Śūdra, and the leavings of any man’
(Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘the leavings of a Śūdra’ (Medhātithi,
Rāghavānanda, Govindarāja and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3. 290);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
451) which explains ‘*paryuṣitam*’ as ‘food kept overnight’, and
‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ as ‘leavings’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 495)
which adds the following notes:—‘*Abhiśasta*’ is ‘one accused of such
crimes as make one outcast,’—‘*ṣaṇḍaka*’ is
‘hermaphrodite,’—‘*puṃścalī*’ is ‘unchaste woman,’—‘*dāmbhika*’ is ‘the
religious hypocrite,’—‘*śukta*’ is that which has been very much soured
by the contact of the juice of other things,—‘*paryuṣita*’ is ‘food kept
over-night,’ even though not soured;—according to Haradatta, food cooked
during the day becomes ‘*paryuṣita*’ after sunset, and that cooked
during the night becomes so after sunrise;—one should not eat the
‘leavings’ of a Śūdra; though the eating of all ‘leavings’ has been
forbidden, yet that of the Śūdra has been specified for the purpose of
indicating that this is doubly objectionable;—or the meaning of the
clause ‘*śūdrasyocchiṣṭam*’ may be that ‘one should not eat a Śūdra’s
food, nor the leavings of any person’;—or ‘out of the dish out of which
a Śūdra has eaten and left some food.’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 772);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 250) which explains ‘*ṣaṇḍaka*’ as ‘sexless’; and adds that of
‘*śaktu*’ and ‘*paryuṣita*’ food, only repeated eating involves
expiation.

‘*Hunter*,’—the professional hunter of animals; one who kills animals
for purposes of hunting, or for the purpose of selling their flesh.

‘*Cruel*,’—whose nature is not straightforward, who is difficult to
please.

‘*One who lives on leavings*,’—*i.e*., one who eats such leavings as
have been forbidden.

‘*Ugra*’—is the name of a special sub-caste. In the Veda, the term is
applied to a kind of king, one who forms the central link in the chain
of the king’s alliance. There is no other prohibition regarding such a
king; it is only in course of showing the evils arising from eating the
food of such kings that we rend—‘the food given by kings deprives one of
one’s energy,’ from which some sort of prohibition may be inferred.
\[For all these reasons, the term ‘*Ugra*’ in the text must be taken to
stand for a particular mixed caste, and not for the *king* \].

‘*Sūtikānnam*’ is food prepared for the woman in childbed; and this
should not be eaten even by men of her own family.

This food is to be avoided ‘*until, ten days have passed*.’ Though, in
the case of the Kṣatriya and other castes, the period of impurity lasts
longer than ten days, yet the food is to be avoided for ten days only.

Another reading is ‘*sūtakānnam*;’ and the term ‘*sūtaka*,’ ‘impurity,’
due to child-birth, in this case, would indicate the *persons* under
that impurity; the meaning being that ‘one should not eat for ten days
the food offered by persons, in whose family there is impurity due to
child-birth.’ This prohibition applies to those cases in which, for all
persons, the period of impurity due to child-birth extends over ten
days. But if the view be taken that impurity due to childbirth applies
to the parents only, or to the mother only,—then food is to be avoided
as long as the period of impurity may last in each particular case;—the
term ‘*until ten days have passed*’ being indicative of the ‘period of
impurity.’ Thus *Kṣattñyas* and others would have their food avoided
during such time as the period of impurity may last in each individual
case.

‘*Sūtikānnamanirdaśam*’ being the right form of the expression, the term
‘*paryācāntam*,’ ‘*that which has been interrupted by washing*,’ has
been made to intervene (between the words, ‘*sūtikānnam*’ and
‘*anirdaśam*’) by considerations of metrical exegencies.

Others have taken ‘*anirdaśam*’ separately, by itself (and not as
qualifying ‘*sūtakānnam*’). Under this, the term ‘*sūtaka*’ would
indicate the period of impurity, and ‘*anirdaśam*’ would stand for the
milk of the cow and other animals (within ten days of their calving).

‘*Interrupted by washing*’— in course of which rinsing and washing have
been done. If, for some reason, the person washes his hand, then he
should not eat of the food left in the dish.—(212)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Ugra*’—‘A man of the *Ugra* caste’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa
and Nandana)—‘a king’ (suggested by Medhātithi, and Govindarāja);—‘one
who perpetrates dreadful deeds’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
451), which adds the following notes:—The food that has been cooked for
the newly-delivered woman should not he eaten by members of her
family;—‘*paryācānta*’—when several men are eating in a line, if any one
of them happen to rinse his mouth, the others should not continue to
eat;—‘*anirdaśam*’ is the food of a man who has not got rid of the
impurity due to child-birth.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 945);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 495), which adds—‘*chikitsaka*’ is ‘one who makes a living
by administering medicine’;—‘*mṛgayu*’ is one who kills animals by means
other than arrows, *i.e*., by means of traps and such
contrivances;—‘*Krūra*’ is the man who harbours within him much anger,
*i.e*., ill-tempered;—‘*ucchiṣṭabhojī*’—who eats such leavings as are
forbidden;—‘*ugra*’ is one who does cruel deeds, or one who is *born of
a Kṣatriya father and* Vaiśya mother, or a king;—‘*Sūtikānnam*’—the food
that has been cooked for a newly-delivered woman should not be eaten
even by members of her own family;—‘*paryācāntam*,’—when several men are
eating in a line, if some one should ignore the presence of others and
rinse his mouth, then the food before the others becomes ‘*paryācānta*’;
but there is no harm if the person rinsing his mouth happen to be one’s
‘elder’;—or ‘*paryācānta*’ may be explained as that food over which the
water of mouth-washing has been thrown;—‘*anirdaśam*’ is the food of a
person still impure by reason of child-birth.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 772);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 200) which has the following notes:—‘*sūtikānnam*’, food cooked for
a woman newly delivered; ‘within ten days of the delivery’
(‘*anirdaśam*’), according to the commentator who says that
‘*anirdaśam*’ qualifies ‘*sūtikānnam*’;—‘*paryācāntam*’, which is in
close proximity to the water dropped in rinsing the mouth.

‘*Offered without respect*,’—that which is given in a disrespectful
maimer, to a person who deserves to be treated with respect. This does
not refer to food that may be offered by friends and others.

‘*Improper meat*,’— which has been cooked for one’s own self, and is not
the remnant of the worship of gods.

‘*Maleless female*,’— one who has neither husband nor son.

‘*Enemy*,’—an adversary.

‘*City-lord*’—one who is the master of a city, though not a king.

‘*Which has been sneered at*,’—over which some one has sneezed.—(213)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Nagaryannam*’—‘Food given by the lord of a city, even though he may
not be a king’ (Medhātithi); ‘food belonging to a whole town’ (Kullūka
and Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
451) which says—‘*anarcita*’ is that which is given in an insulting
manner; ‘*vṛthā-māṃsa*’ is that which has not been prepared for offering
to the gods and Pitṛs;—the ‘*avīrā*’ woman is one who has no husband or
son; this prohibition applies to only such women as are not related to
one’s self;—‘*nagaryanna*’ is the food belonging to the master of a
city;—‘*avakṣuta*’ is that over which some one has sneezed.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 945);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 495), which adds the following notes:—‘*anarcita*’,—the food
is so called when it is offered without due respect, to one who deserves
respect;—‘*vṛthāmāṃsa*’ is that meat which has not been cooked for
offering to the gods and Pitṛs;—‘*avīrā*’ is a woman without husband or
sons, or grandsons or great-grandsons; this prohibition applies to the
case of an unrelated woman, such being the custom, says
Śūlapāṇi;—‘*dviṣat*’,—is one who causes injury;—‘*nagarī*’ is the master
of a city, even though he may not be the king, says
Medhātithi;—‘*patita*’ is the Brāhmaṇa-murderer and the
like;—‘*avakṣutam*’—sneezed upon.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 773);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 260), which adds the following notes:—‘*Anarcitam*’, rejected as
bad,—‘*avīrā*’, a woman without husband or sons or any male
relatives,—‘*nagarī*’ means a ‘person in charge of a
city’,—‘*avakṣutam*’, which has been sneezed upon.

(Do.) (2.6.19).—‘One should not eat the food of that person towards whom
one is unfriendly, or who is unfriendly to one; or defective meat.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.2).—(See above.)

*Viṣṇu* (51.11, 18, 10).—‘Food of the maleless woman, of the goldsmith,

‘*Informer*,’—one who betrays the confidence reposed in him; or one who
talks ill of persons behind their back.

‘*Perjurer*,’—who has given false evidence.

‘*Seller of sacrifices*,’— who, having performed a sacrifice, sells its
fruit; *i.e*., says to another person,—‘May the fruit of this sacrifice
be yours,’ and receives a price for it. Though, in reality, there can be
no ‘selling’ of a sacrifice, yet, what is forbidden, is the food of a
person who makes such living, or who undertakes sacrifice with a view to
cheat others.

‘*Śailūṣa*’—is actor; or, according to others, he who exposes his wife

‘*Ungrateful person*,’—he who nullities the good that has been done to

The man mentioned in the preceding verse is one who does not know of the
presence of his wife’s paramour; while the one mentioned here is one who
knows it, and suffers it, and does not check his wife. If the man does
not know of the presence of the paramour, who comes from another house,
then the food given by such a man is not forbidden.

‘*Who are ruled by women*,’—those persons in whose house the wife is the
sole mistress and dispenser; and who are not master of themselves or of
their dependants; who are entirely under the control of their wives.

‘*Pretānnam*;’—when one is impure, on account of death in his house, the
food belonging to the members of his family is forbidden.—‘*Ten days
have not passed*;’—this indicates the period of time.

If the term, ‘*anirdaśam*’ (of verse 212), is to be taken by itself, as
forbidding the food belonging to ‘impure’ persons, then ‘the food
belonging to persons in whose house there has been death’ being already
included there, the present term would stand for the food of those
persons who are directly connected with the impurity; such persons, for
instance, as the friends and maternal relations of the dead. Similarly,
one shall not eat the food belonging to one who may be engaged in the
performance of such rites as the

‘*Caturthī-Śrāddha*,’ and the like, which is undertaken through sympathy
with the person in whose house the death has occurred. Such *śrāddhas*
have been mentioned by the Authors of *Gṛhyasūtras*, as also in the
*Rāmāyaṇa*, in such passages as—‘The *tenth-day Śrāddha*, the *Ninth-day
Śrāddha*, the *Eighth-day Śrāddha*, the *Fourth-day Śrāddha*, etc.’

The Text now proceeds to describe the effects of transgressing the above
prohibitions.

One who eats the king’s food loses his vigour; and so with all the rest.

The terms ‘goldsmith’ and the rest, are denotative of particular
*professions*; so that those persons who deal in making articles of gold
are called goldsmiths. Similarly, with ‘dyer’ and other terms. Those who
cut leather are called ‘leather-cutters,’ this name being applied to
those who live by this trade.

In the present context, there are some whose food has not been forbidden
in the foregoing verses; but the evil results flowing therefrom are now
described; the prohibition of these is to be inferred from the
latter.—(218)

‘*Three days fast*;’—*i.e*., he shall not eat anything for three days.

‘*Unknowingly*,’—not intentionally.

In the case of its being done *intentionnlly*, one should perform the
‘*Kṛcchra*’ penance. And this *^(‘)Kṛcchra*’ should be the
‘*Tapta-kṛcchra*,’ in view of what other Smṛti texts have laid down. One
such text (Gautama 23.2) has prescribed the ‘*Tapta-kṛcchra*’ as to be
performed in the case of eating semen; ordure and urine;—*viz*., ‘In the
event of drinking these intentionally, one shall live upon milk, butter,
water and air—upon each of these for three days; this is the
*Taptātikṛcchra*; and then follows his purification,’

The present being not a section dealing with Expiatory Rites, the
mention of such a rite is meant to indicate the seriousness of the
offence.

In view of the phrase, ‘*of any one of these*,’ being in the Genitive
form, some people have held that the Expiatory Rite here prescribed is
meant to apply to only those cases where the food actually belongs to
the persons mentioned, and *not* where it is objectionable by reason of
time, or by its very nature, or by contact. Among such articles of food
as sour-gruel and the like, non-eatability is of four kinds:—(1) some
things are non-eatable, because of time ; *e.g*., sour-gruel, things
kept overnight, and so forth; (2) some are non-eatable, because of
contact; *e.g*, things that have come in contact with wine and such
things; (3) some are non-eatble by their very nature; *e.g*., garlic and
such things; (4) some are non-eatable by reason of their owner; *e.g*.,
the food of the persons enumerated in the present context.

Our answer to the above is as follows:—It is quite true that there are
four kinds of *non-eatability*; it is true also that the text has used
the Genitive form; but if the Expiatory Rite here prescribed did not
pertain to such food as *sour gruel* and the like, but only to what is
objectionable in regard to its owner, then the mention of these in the
present connection would be entirely meaningless. For the prohibition of
these two things is coining under Discourse V. From this it is clear
that their mention in the present context is only for the purpose of
prescribing the Expiatory Rite.

“Why, then, should they he mentioned in Discourse V.?”

This we shall explain at that place. As for the exact meaning and
purpose of such texts as—(*a*) ‘the eating of the first two is
objectionable’ and (*b*) ‘having eaten the food of persons whose food
should not he eaten,’ *etc*. (11.152),—we shall explain all this in
detail under those same texts—(222).

Śūdra’s food has been forbidden generally; and particular details
regarding it are now laid down—‘*who does not perform Śrūddhas*.

“Where has Śūdra’s food been forbidden?”

It has been forbidden in 4. 211.

“What is forbidden there is Śūdra’s *leavings*, and not other kinds of
food.”

Not so; the said verse (211) is to be construed as—‘the Śūdra’s food
should not be eaten, *nor the leavings of others*.’ The explanation that
we gave above of this verse, was in accordance with the older
Commentators; as we clearly pointed out there.

‘*Who does not perform Śrāddhas*.’—‘*Śrāddha*’ here stands for the
*sacrificing of cooked food* and such other rites as have been
prescribed for the Śūdra; hence, the meaning is ‘who does nor perform
these rites.’ What is meant is that ‘one shall not eat the cooked food
of any *Śūdra*, except those of the better class.’

Another reading is ‘*aśraddhinaḥ*’ (for ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*); which means,
‘who is devoid of faith;’ in the next verse also we find special stress
laid down upon ‘faith,’ by the term ‘*vadānya*,’ ‘liberal.’

‘*Raw*’—dry; paddy, rice, and so forth.

‘*Sufficient for one day*’—just that quantity which may suffice for one
day,—not more.—(223)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 341), which explains
‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as ‘one who does not offer the daily Śrāddhas’; and adds
that this is meant to indicate the compulsory character of these
Śrāddhas,—and ‘*ekarātrikam*’ is explained as ‘what is enough for one
day.”

Buhler notes that Nārāyaṇa explains ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as ‘destitute of
faith’. But the reading thus explained must be ‘*aśraddhinaḥ*’ which is
a var: lec: noted by Medhātithi.

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 490) which adds that
the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ here must be taken as standing for the *Pākayajña*,
which is prescribed for the *Śūdra*;—he who performs that is called
‘*Śrāddhin*’;—if a Śūdra does not perform it, his ‘cooked food’ should
not be eaten;—such is the explanation given by Medhātithi. *Kalpataru*
on the other hand, has explained the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ as standing for
the *daily Śrāddhas*. In some places the word is read as
‘*Aśraddhinaḥ*’, which means ‘devoid of faith’.—In the event of
‘abnormal distress’—‘*avṛttau*’—one should receive from him uncooked—not
cooked—rice or other grain, just enough to last for one day.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 250);—in *Prāyascittaviveka*
(p. 253), which explains ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as the Śūdra ‘who is not
entitled to partake of Śrāddha food’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
785);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 320).

*Parāśara* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 492).—‘The food remains ‘Śūdra’s
food’ only so long as as it has not been touched by the twice-born; as
soon as it has been touched by the twice-born’s hand, it becomes sacred
food.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘Śūdra’s food when placed in a vessel belonging to the
twice-born is not objectionable.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Do.).—‘When Śūdra’s food comes to one’s house, it should
be eaten after water has been sprinkled over it.’

*Āpastamba* (1.18, 3 *et. seq*.).—‘ He may accept uncooked food; or even
cooked food, such as is devoid of relish; he should desist after getting
just what would keep him alive.’

*Aṅgiras* (68-73).—‘He who eats the Śūdra’s food continuously for a
mouth, even during that same life, becomes a Śūdra, and after death, is
born a dog. There is no rise upwards for one who reads, sacrifices or
offers oblations while nourished by food given by the Śūdra. If a man
has recourse to his wife after eating of the food given by a Śūdra, the
son begotten by him belongs to that Śūdra. If a man dies with Śūdra’s
food in his stomach, he is born as a hog, or is born in the family of
that same Śūdra.’

*Gautama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 489).—‘Food may be begged from all
castes, with, the exception of such persons as are accused or outcast.’

*Hārita* (Do., p. 490).—‘One who dies with Śūdra’s food in his stomach
is born as a mule or a camel, and becomes a Śūdra.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘The twice-born man dying with Śūdra’s food in his
stomach becomes a hog, etc., etc.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 491).—‘The Agnihotrin who does not desist from Śūdra’s
food loses his soul, his Veda and his three Fires.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.).—‘The householder who eats Śūdra’s food loses his
strength and vigour.’

What is meant is the Brāhmaṇa endowed with all necessary
qualifications,—the term ‘Vedic Scholar’ being meant to be purely
illustrative. ‘*Vedic Scholar*’ means the learned man who performs all
the duties that have been laid down for him. If such a person happens to
be ‘*miserly*’—who does not take delight in receiving friends, relations
and guests, and who does not wish to give anything to any person.

The other person is the ‘*usurer*,’ living on usury, and thus engaged in
objectional business. If he happens to be ‘*liberal*,’ noble-minded,
endowed with faith, is delighted at the arrival of people at his house,
and duly honors them with food and other things.

The food belonging to these two persons the gods have ordained to be
‘*equal*.’

Even though one of them (the former) is possessed of all good qualities,
yet he is condemned by reason of his niggardliness. It has been declared
that ‘covetousness spoils all good qualities.’ The other person, even
though endowed with due faith, is censured by reason of his
objectionable business. Hence, ‘*having examined*’—duly pondered over
the matter—the gods have ordained that the food belonging to the two
persons stands on the same footing.—(224)

*Baudhāyana* (1.5.63).—‘Having compared the food offered by a man pure
but devoid of faith, and that by one impure, but endowed with faith,—the
gods declared them to he equal. Prajāpati told them that the two were
not equal, hut unequal; what is offered by the faithless being damned,
that which is purified by faith is distinctly superior.’

*Mahābhārata* (Śānti., 270.10).—‘People learned in the ancient lore
recite certain verses sung by Brāhmaṇas:—In connection with the
sacrificial performance the gods regarded as similar the food offered by
the pure hut faithless man and that offered by the impure but faithful;
similarly also that offered by the miserly Vedic scholar and by the
generous woman,—having compared these two, they regarded them as equal.
Prajāpati however told them that they had committed a mistake; that
offered by the generous is purified by faith, while the other is damned
through want of faith.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.14).—‘One should eat the food offered even by the thief,
if he is endowed with faith; but never of that man who sacrifices for,
or initiates, many people.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 508).—‘Even food offered by one’s
teacher should not be eaten, if it is not offered with respect.’

Thereupon Prajāpati came to them and said—“Do not make the unequal equal: what belongs to the liberal man is purified by faith, while the other is defiled by want of faith.—(225)

Prajāpati, having approached, said to the gods —‘*Do not in this way,
make the unequal eaual*’—*i.e*., do not establish any such improper
equalisation.

Then the gods asked—‘Who there is, then, the superior between the two
persons?’

Then Prajāpati answered—‘The food that belongs to the liberal-minded
usurer, who is endowed with faith, is purified by faith, while the other
food, that belongs to the Vedic scholar, is censured, condemned, by his
act (faithlessness).’

This dialogue between Prajāpati and the gods is purely imaginary; all
that is meant is that ‘one shall not eat food offered by a person, who,
though otherwise qualified, is devoid of faith, while that belonging to
the *Śūdra* shall be eaten, if it is offered with due respect.’—(225)
