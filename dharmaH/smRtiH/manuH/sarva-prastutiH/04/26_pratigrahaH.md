     This reading makes little sense. Jha's translation presupposes "abhaya" — abhayadakṣiṇā is really not a gift, because there is no transfer of ownership. DK (5: 1179) suggests: anyarūpatā

‘*Fuel*’—the wood, etc, to burn.

‘*Food*’—either cooked or raw.

‘*Offered*’—presented before him.

All this may be accepted from all persons;—*i.e*., even from *Śūdras*,
or persons who may have committed minor sins; only avoiding the outcast,
the accused, the Cāṇḍāla and other low castes mixed in the reverse
order.’

‘*Madhu*’—Honey.

‘*Gift* *of fearlessness*.’—Fearlessness is the form of a gift. This is
mentioned by way of illustration. In fact, the ‘acceptance of a gift’
consists in accepting something which another person voluntarily offers;
and the ‘possession of fearlessness’ is not of this kind; as, in this
case, no one’s ownership ceases, nor is any one’s ownership produced (as
there is in all cases of giving and gifts). It is for this reason that
the term, ‘gift,’ has been used in this connection, only by way of
eulogising the said promise. The meaning is that—‘just as, when one is
passing through a forest or jungle, there is no harm in acceptiong
(accepting?) the protection offered even by Cāṇḍālas, robbers, and such
other persons, so also there is nothing objectionable in the accepting
of fuel and the other things mentioned here.’

The rule here laid down applies to normal times; it is going to be
declared later on that in abnormal times of distress, one may accept
gifts even from Caṇḍālas and others.

The term, ‘*offered*,’ is, through proximity, to be construed with
‘*food*’ only, not with ‘*fuel*’ and the rest. Hence, in connection with
these latter, even begging is not objectionable.

The general rule being—‘gifts should be accepted only from righteous
twice-born persons,’ no one would think of accepting them from either
unrighteous twice-born persons, or from *Śūdras*. Hut, in the case of
certain things (fuel, etc.), begging is considered desirable. Hence the
present text—(247)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 406), which explains
‘*abhayadaksiṇā*’ as ‘*abhayadāna*’, ‘gift of fearlessness’;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.214);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 190);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 220), which adds the following
explanations:—‘*edha*’ is ‘fuel’,—‘*sarvataḥ*’ means ‘even from the
Śūdra’,—the ‘gift of fearlessness’ being acceptable even from a
*Mleccha*; all this refers to one who is still engaged in the receiving
of gifts, not to one who has renounced the acceptance of gifts;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 249), which adds—‘*sarvataḥ*’ means ‘even from
the Śūdra the ‘gift of fearlessness’ being acceptable from the Mleccha
also;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, pp. 35b and 37b);—and in *Hemādri*

‘presented unasked.’

This verse asserts the acceptability of even things other than fuel and
the rest (mentioned in the preceding verse).

The term ‘*bhikṣā*,’ ‘*alms*,’ has been used in an appreciatory sense;
and it is not striclty *alms* that is meant here; though, in reality,
the term ‘*alms*’ denotes *a small quantity of cooked food*,—and it is
on account of smallness of its quantity that its acceptance is not
regarded as open to serious objection; Specially as, for the Student, it
has been permitted as coming from all castes. And what is meant by the
present text is that other things also may be treated on the same
footing. The term ‘alms’ is often found to be used in this sense;
*e.g*., in the *Mahābhārata* (1.206.1)—‘The two high-souled sons of
Pṛthā went to Pṛthā at the carpenter’s shop and joyously informed her of
their having received *Draupadi* as *alms*.’

‘*Brought forward*’—to that place where the recipient stands.

‘*Offered*’—placed before the recipient, who is told, either by a
gesture, or with actual words, to accept it. ‘*Previously*’—at any
previous time.

‘*Not begged*,’—not asked for by the recipient; nor promised by the
giver, either directly, or through some one else, to the effect
that,—‘such and such a thing there is in my house; please have the
kindness to accept it;’ only what is offered without premeditation,
actually thought of at the moment itself.

Such alms ‘*Prajāpati*’—Hiraṇyagarbha—*has declared*,—what?—*to be
acceptable even from* *a* *sinful person*,—the sinful person being one
whose actions are sinful—(248)

This is an imaginary assertion, deprecating the non-acceptance of the
said gifts.

That person who disdains, refuses to accept it,—his *Śrāddha* the
‘*Pitṛs do not eat*’—do no accept; nor does Fire convey his offerings to
the gods. That is, such a man does not derive any benefit from rites
performed for the *Pitṛs* or for the gods.

In this connection, some one has asserted that—“Even though what is
offered happens to be of no use, it should be accepted, as a favour to
the giver.”

This, however, is not right; as all that the text means is that gift,
offered unasked, may be accepted without harm; and what is said here is
a counter-exception, and there can be ‘counter-exception’ only in favour
of what has been forbidden; so that, what may he had recourse to by
reason of ordinary want having been forbidden (by a previous text), the
present text lays down a counter-exception.—(249)

‘*Dead*’—and past; or when, even though the Teachers be living, the man
lives apart from them.

The term, ‘*Teachers*, ‘here includes all *dependants* also.

‘*Seeking his own subsistence*,’ he shall accept gifts from
‘*good*’—righteous—‘*persons*.’ No caste being specified, acceptance is
permitted from righteous *Śūdras* also; as is said under 223—‘A Brāhmaṇa
shall not eat, etc., etc.’—(252)

‘*Ardhika*,’ ‘*Ploughman*,’ is the man who ploughs his family-holdings
for him.

‘*Cowherd* and *slave*’—arc terms denoting relationship. One may eat
food of that person who keeps his cows for him.

‘*He who offers himself*;’—saying, ‘you are my sole refuge; I live
solely dependent upon you’—one who offers oneself in this manner, is
also one whose food may be eaten.—(253).
