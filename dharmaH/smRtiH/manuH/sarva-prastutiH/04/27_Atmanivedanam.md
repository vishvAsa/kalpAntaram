As the man’s character may be, as may be the nature of the work he wishes to do, and as may be the manner in which he may serve,—even so must he offer himself.—(254)

The text proceeds to show the manner of ‘offering himself.’

‘*As may be the character of the man*,’—*i.e*., the family, the country
and the profession to which the *Śūdra* concerned may belong.

‘*The work he wishes to do*;’—saying, ‘This is the work that I shall do
under you, either as my duty, or for s ome other purpose, such as saving
myself from being pressed for service at the royal palace, and so
forth.’

‘*The manner in which he may serve*;’—‘I shall serve you with this act
of mine;’—‘I shall press your feet, and do other household work.’ When
one offers to do all this, then is he said to have ‘*offered himself*.’

‘Others have taken the word,’ ‘*Ātman*’ ‘himself,’ in the expression,
‘*Ātmanām nivedayet*,’ ‘offers himself,’ to mean *child*—according to
the text, ‘thou art my own self, named *son*;’ and have explained it to
mean that ‘one may eat the food of the *Śūdra*, whose *daughter*
(*ātma*) one may have married, under the influence of sexual passion.’
This, however, is not right. The term, ‘ātmā’ is never used directly in
the sense of *daughter*; it is only the masculine form ‘*putra*,’ ‘son,’
that is often found to be so used; and there would be no useful purpose
served by the Author using a term, in an indirect sense; it would have
been enough to say—‘he who gives his daughter to him.’

Others have explained that the mention of the ‘ploughman’ and others is
meant to be indicative of the *Śūdra* in general; so that it follows
that one may cat the food of one’s father-in-law of the ‘*Pāraśava*’
caste (son of a Brāhmaṇa from a *Śūdra* mother).—(254)

*Cf*. 5.253.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 492), which explains
‘*ātmanivedana*’ as ‘declaring his family, his character, his motive in
seeking service and the ways in which he is going to serve’;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 785).

254	As his character is, as the work is which he desires to perform, and as the manner is in which he means to serve, even so (a voluntary slave) must offer himself.

Being of one kind,;—*i.e*., unrighteous—if he describes himself to
‘*good men*’—to cultured people—‘*otherwise*’—describing himself as
*righteous*;—or, when he goes to a man for one purpose, and represents
it to be something else,—such a person is the worst of all sinners.

‘*Thief*’— stealer;—‘*stealing himself*.’ Other thieves steal things,
while this person steals himself. This shows the despicable character of
the man.—(255)

255	He who describes himself to virtuous (men), in a manner contrary to truth, is the most sinful (wretch) in this world; he is a thief who makes away with his own self.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The relation between words and their denotations being eternal, things
are described as ‘*regulated by speech*.’

‘*Have their root in speech*.’— Things are said to have their root in
speech, in view of the fact that the ideas of the speaker depend, for
their manifestation, upon speech.

‘*Emanate from speech*,’—are produced out of speech; things are so
called, because the ideas of the hearer also are dependent upon speech.

It is not necessary to suspect, or attempt an explanation of, the
repetition here involved; because what is stated here is merely a
description of things as they are, and as such may be put forward in any
manner possible.

He who ‘*steals such speech*’—misrepresents, having said one thing, does
something else; he says something in one sense, and represents it in
another sense;—‘*is the stealer of all things*;’—there is no substance,
gold or anything else, which such a man has not stolen.

This is an *imaginary* statement, deprecatory of *telling a
lie*.—(*256*)

<details><summary>Bühler</summary>

256	All things (have their nature) determined by speech; speech is their root, and from speech they proceed; but he who is dishonest with respect to speech, is dishonest in everything.
