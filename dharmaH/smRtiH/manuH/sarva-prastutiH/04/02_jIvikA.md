By ‘*trouble*’ here is meant, not only *harm*, but the unpleasant
feeling or displeasure that is produced in the mind of one who is
constantly begged with the words ‘give me this,’ ‘give me that;’—the
*harming* of others being already generally prohibited.

‘*Little trouble*;’—If he cannot manage to live without begging, he
should beg very little. This is what.is meant by ‘little trouble.’

That ‘*means of livelihood*’—means of subsistence, such as agriculture,
service, and the like—which means does not cause trouble to other
persons,—such a means of subsistence should be taken to.

This is a general advice.

‘*By taking to that means...he should subsist*.’

What is to be done in abnormal times of distress shall be laid down in
Discourse X.

From what is said here it follows that there are also other means of
living than those that are going to be described. Otherwise, if the
present text referred to those only that are going to be described,
there would be no point in the general injunction here put forward. Thus
it is that we get at such means of living as ‘officiating at
sacrifices,’ ‘teaching,’ ‘money-lending,’ and so forth,—even though
these are not mentioned among ‘*amṛta*’ and the rest enumerated here.

‘Living on gleanings,’ which has been accepted as a very small means of
subsistence, is what is meant by ‘involving little trouble.’ Says
Gautama (10.6)—‘Agriculture and Trade, done through others, as also
money-lending.’

What is here laid down is the means of mere subsistence; the amassing of
wealth is to be done by the few specialised means going to be
enumerated.—(2)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The preceding verse has described the means of daily subsistence; the
present verse is going to mention rules regarding the accumulating of
wealth.

‘*One shall accumulate wealth by means of one’s own occupations*.’—These
occupations shall be described later on.

The author states the purpose for which wealth is to be accumulated:
‘*For the accomplishment of bare maintenance*’—Wealth shall be
accumulated, not for the purposes of pleasure, but simply for the sake
of maintenance. ‘*Maintenance*’ stands for the subsisting of oneself and
one’s family; and what just suffices for that is called ‘*bare
maintenance*;’—‘*the accomplishment*,’ or bringing about of this, is the
‘*purpose*’ of the accumulation. The performance of obligatory duties is
included under one’s ‘own subsistence;’ for, until one performs these,
one’s own subsistence is not accomplished. It has been said above
(3.72)—‘he who does not make the five offerings, is not alive, even
though he may be breathing.’

Or, what is meant is that, even though a certain means of accumulating
wealth may be sanctioned by the scriptures, if it happen to be such as
is considered reproachable in the eyes of men, it shall be avoided. For
instance, when a man of noble family has spent all his belongings, he
shall avoid living by such means as the receiving of gifts from a person
of his own caste, but of a low family, who may have acquired wealth.

‘*Without causing trouble to the body*’—Service and Trade are sources of
great suffering to the body, involving as they do long journeys and
other troubles: so that these should be avoided.

‘*Accumulation*.’—Collecting and keeping.—(3).

The author now mentions the “occupations” by name; and their mere names
imply the excellence of some of them; and from this it follows that one
should have recourse to the deprecated ones only when the commended ones
are not possible.

Of these, the “Death” and the “Super-Death” are the most deprecated; and
worse than these is the “Truth and Falsehood,” as is clear from the fact
that the Text says that one may live ‘*even* by these;’ where the term
‘*even*’ clearly indicates undesirability.—(4)

The corn that is gleaned is to be known as ‘Truth;’ living by this means
being regarded as equal to the strict observance of truth. When after
harvesting, corn is being carried either home or to the granary, if
certain ears of corn fall down on the ground, and are left by the
owner’—the picking up of these is what is called “gleaning;” and this is
called ‘Truth;’ and in regard to this, one need not entertain any such
idea as ‘this belongs to another person, so I shall not take it.’

Similarly, when one takes away what has fallen off from the sheaf—either
before or after harvesting,—and what forms part of several
offshoots,—this is ‘picking.’

‘*What is obtained unasked is* *Nectar*’—so called, because it is a
source of great pleasure.

‘*The alms obtained by begging is Death*.’— The term ‘begging’ itself
signifying the fact of what is obtained being ‘alms,’ the addition of
this latter term—which is formed by the adding of a Nominal Affix
denoting a *group* or *collection*,—is meant to imply that several
persons shall be begged, and no single person shall be constantly
troubled, as is shown by what has been said above regarding ‘what
involves very little trouble to living beings.’ Then again, as a rule,
the term ‘*bhaikṣa*,’ ‘alms,’ is found to be used in the sense of
*cooked food*; as we find in the case of such passages as—‘for the
purpose of cleansing oneself from *alms*;’ hence the adding of the term
‘begging’ serves to indicate that ‘alms’ stands here for *food in
general*; hence what is meant here is not *cooked food* only; specially
as for one who has set up the Fire, it would be wrong to make the
*Vaiśvadeva* and other offerings with food cooked in any other fire.

The begging of alms here spoken of is not meant to be that only which is
got for eating; it stands for what enables the man to maintain himself;
and the maintenance of the householder is not accomplished merely by
eating; in fact, it requires all such things as are necessary for
house-keeping; hence it is that water-vessels and other such articles
should also be begged; as also such household-requisites as dishes and
covers, etc. So far as the Student is concerned, since for him it is
impossible that just at the time of his eating, cooking should be done
in the proper manner;—it follows that in his case ‘alms’ must mean
*cooked food* only.

The term ‘*bhikṣā*,’ ‘alms,’ also indicates the quantity of the article
obtained by begging; this quantity being a mere *handful*. But when a
man is begged, he does not give mere alms, a mere handful; so that the
begging of the cow, gold and such other things could not be regarded as
sanctioned by the mere ‘handful.’ In fact, begging is always done for
the purpose of receiving all kinds of gifts.

“The receiving of *alms* also would be a receiving of gifts.”

No; mere acceptance does not constitute the ‘receiving of gifts;’ the
root ‘*graha*,’ with the preposition ‘*prati*,’—*i.e*., the term
‘*pratigraha*,’ ‘receiving of gifts’—is applied to a particular form of
‘acceptance,’ and not to any and every *acceptance*. Wherever the term
‘*pratigraha*,’ ‘gift,’ is used—*e. g*., under 4.186 and 10.100—it is
used in the sense of such *gift* as is offered with a view to some
transcendental result, and is received with due *mantras*. In the
receiving of mere ‘*alms*,’ however, there is no reciting of any such
*mantra* as ‘*devasya tvā, etc*.’ Nor again, is the term applied to the
accepting of friendly and other presents; in the sense of this latter,
the term is never used.

From all this it follows that the terms ‘Truth’ and ‘Nectar’ are used in
the sense of things other than ‘gifts.’ Hence, in this case, the man who
gives, whether begged or un-begged, is a high-souled person, and, hence,
in his mind there does not arise any desire for any form of return (for
the gift he makes); so that there would be no grounds for any
restriction as to the caste, etc., of the recipient or giver. When a
present is made entirely through sympathy for the receiver, it does not
become a ‘gift’ (which always connotes the presence of desire for some
transcendental result).

“But what is given through sympathy or pity is also conducive to
transcendental results.”

We say—no; because it does not fulfil the conditions of ‘*dāna*,’
‘giving’ (formal); it being prompted either by pity or by the desire to
do good to others. Hence, just as in offering advice, through sympathy,
considerations of caste do not come in; so in the case of giving through
pity also. It is for this reason that in the case of such giving,
cultured people do not observe any such restrictions as ‘gifts should be
offered to the Brāhmaṇa who knows the real meaning of the Veda,’ and so
forth. It is for this same reason, again, that even non-Brāhmaṇas, on
becoming poor, accept gifts offered by others, but are not, on that
account, regarded as having ‘received gifts,’ and thus transgressed upon
the Brāhmaṇas ‘livelihood.’

The conclusion, therefore, is as follows:—Though in the regular
‘*gift*,’ considerations of its being *asked* or *unasked* do come in,
yet it does not, merely on that account, become either ‘Truth’ or
‘Nectar;’ because it has been shown that these terms have a different
connotation.

This same connotation is applicable to ‘officiating at sacrifices’ and
‘teaching’ (the other two means of livelihood for the Brāhmaṇa): Some
one obtains the post of officiating at a sacrifice after having begged
for it from some one. Similarly with the work of Teaching also.

Any such means of living as is obtained by begging, involves
humiliation; and hence, resembling death, it is called ‘death.’

Cultivating is worse even than Death; specially as the act of ploughing
and carrying of burdens is the work of lower people.—(5)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 309), which
explains the difference between ‘*uñcha*’ and ‘*śila*’ by taking ṭhe
former to mean the picking up *of single grains*, of corn and the latter
that of ears of com fallen on the ground;—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II,

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (1.2.25.23).—‘He may live either by *Nectar* or by *Death;
Nectar* is that which is obtained unasked, and *Death* is the alms
obtained by begging.’

*Bṛhad-Yama* (60, 62).—‘The Brāhmaṇa is ruined by serving the king.
Those Brāhmaṇas who serve such masters as should not be served, and who
officiate at sacrifices for those for whom it should not be done, are to
be regarded as *impure* and beyond the pale of all Dharma.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2.27).—‘When unable to maintain himself by means of his own
occupations, he shall never have recourse to a sinful occupation.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.25).—‘In abnormal times of distress, the Brāhmaṇa may
maintain himself by the occupation of the Kṣatriya, or by that of the
Vaiśya.’

*Viṣṇu* (2.15).—‘In times of distress, the occupation of the next

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.69, 72).—‘Being unable to maintain himself by
teaching, officiating at sacrifices, and receiving of gifts, he shall
live by the occupation of the Kṣatriya; this being the next best for
him;—he may also have recourse to the occupation of the Vaiśya; this
being the next best.’

*Gautama* (7.6-7).—‘In the absence of the aforesaid, the occupation of
the Kṣatriya; in the absence of this latter also, the occupation of the
Vaiśya.’

It should not be understood that the scripture here lays down the fact
of Trade being both ‘true’ and ‘false;’ it only describes the nature of
the thing; and what constitutes the ‘falsehood’ of Trade is the element
of avaricious grabbing involved in it.

‘*May live*.’—This implies that Trade may be had recourse to, only for
the purposes of livelihood, never for that of accumulating wealth.

‘*Service is the living* *of* *the dog*.’—The dog is made to work hard,
and gets little and with difficulty; so also the servant. ‘*Service*’
here connotes being *ordered about*; the servant is always commanded to
do this and that work, right as well as wrong. Hence, when people serve
kings with such superior kind of work as the carrying of arms and the
like, these are not regarded ‘as the living of dogs,’—(6)

It has been declared that wealth should be accumulated for the
maintenance of oneself and family; and no trouble shall be undertaken
for mere pleasure; it has not been said whether the man is to acquire
wealth day by day, or only once, sufficient to last for a long time.
Hence the Text now proceeds to show how one is to earn a living lasting
for some length of time.

‘*Kusūladhānyakaḥ*.’—One who has grains in a granary; the compound being
a *Bahuvrīhi*, where the members are not in apposition to each other.

Another reading is ‘*Kusūladhānyikaḥ*;’ in which case, the term
*Kusūladhānya* would mean ‘grains enough to fill a granary;’ and one who
possesses this would be ‘*Kusūladhānyika*;’ the word being formed with
the Possessive affix ‘*ik*.’

Receptacles built of bricks and such things, which contain grains, are
called ‘*Kusūla*’ or ‘*Koṣṭha*,’ ‘granary;’ and this term serves to
indicate the quantity; the sense being that ‘one shall accumulate grains
in such quantities as may fill a granary and it does not mean that ‘he
must use the *granary only* as the receptacle for grains.’ What the text
permits, by means of the word ‘granary,’ is the accumulating of just
that quantity of grain which may suffice to maintain for one year the
family of a man with large responsibilities, having a large number of
servants, relations, wives, slaves, children, cattle, horse, and such
other things. That such is the sense, is shown by what is going to be
said (in 11.7) regarding the man who has grains sufficient for three
years.

Significance is not meant to be attached to the term ‘grains’ also; in
fact, there would be nothing wrong in the man acquiring such quantities
of gold, silver and such things as would suffice for the said
maintenance. All that the text means is that one should not accumulate
more than that.

‘*Kumbhī*’ is the same ‘*uṣṭṛka*,’ ‘jar.’ They say that this stands for
such quantity as would suffice for six months.

‘*Trayahaihika*;’—‘*aihika*’ means ‘*wanted*;’ he who has what is wanted
for three days is ‘*trayahaihika*;’ which is the name given to one who
collects what is enough for the requirements of his family for three
days.

‘*Śvastana*’ is *what is needed for the morrow*; he who possesses this
is, as before, ‘*Śvastanika*;’ and this compound, with the negative
particle, gives the term ‘*aśvastanika*;’ ‘who does not possess enough
for the morrow.’ The meaning is that he should acquire what just
suffices for the time, what he earns he should spend all that the same
day.—(7)

The author next states the law relating to the options just mentioned:—
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Kusūladhānyakaḥ*’—Having as much grain as is contained in a *Kusūla*,
a granary, *i*. *e*., enough to feed the household for *one year*’ (not
*three* as mentioned by Buhler) \[Medhātithi\];—‘enough to last twelve
days’ (Govindarāja);—‘enough for three years’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘enough for twelve, six or three months’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Kumbhīdhānyakaḥ*’—‘Having as much grain as may be contained in a
*Kumbhī*, *i.e*., enough to last for six months’ (Medhātithi);—‘enough
to last for six days’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘enough for one year’
(Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 169);—in *Mitākṣarā*, (on
1.128), which adds that this refers, not to all Brāhmaṇas, but to those
only who are ‘*yāyāvara*’ *i.e*., ‘who devote themselves entirely to
study, sacrifice and making gifts, and do not have recourse to teaching,
sacrificing for others and receiving gifts, or amassing of wealth’
(according to Devala);—also on 3.29, as describing the four kinds of
‘Householder’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 216);—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II,
p. 246), which explains ‘*Kusūla*’ as ‘*Koṣṭhakam*,’—‘*Kumbhī*’ as
‘*aṣṭrikā*,’ and the whole compound as ‘one who possesses grain enough
to fill the one or the other’;—‘*tryahika*’ as ‘one who has grains
enough *to last for* three days,’ and ‘*aśvastana*’ as ‘one not having
grains for the morrow’;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 37a).

*Yājñavalkya* (1.228).—‘He may be the possessor of a granary-full or a
jar-full of grains, or of grain enough for three days, or of grain not
enough for the morrow; or he may live by gleaning and picking; the
succeeding being superior to the preceding among these.’

*Laghu-Viṣṇu* (2.16-17).—‘The virtuous householders are divided into
four classes according to the difference in their means of livelihood;
of these the following is superior to the preceding. \[Three quarters of
Manu’s text being reproduced, the fourth part is read as
*sadyaḥprakṣālakaḥ*, one who had just enough for the last meal that he
has had.\]’

*Mahābhārata* (12.249.2-3).—‘Four kinds of livelihood for householders
have been described by the wise—the first is the possessing of a
granary-full of grains; then the possessing of a jar-full of grains;
then the possessing of not enough for the morrow; and the last is the
method of the pigeon (having nothing beyond the present meal); among

The person who accumulates wealth enough for a shorter time is superior,
better, in point of merit; and superiority of merit leads to superiority
of reward—‘*he is a superior winner of worlds*’—he wins the wolrds;
*i.e*., takes possession of them, as their master; *i.e*., obtains them
for his enjoyment. The suffix ‘*tama*’ denotes *excellence*. In the
absence of qualifications, the term ‘worlds’ here is taken as standing
for the *heavenly regions*.

For these reasons, the rule on this point would be as follows:—

(*a*) He who has vast responsibilities, having many children, whose sons
have not set up separate houses, who has not married away his
daughters,—such a person should possess a granary full of corns;—(*b*)
he, however, who has become advanced in age, has got children, has done
all that he had to do,—such a person, as he goes on withdrawing from
activities, should have recourse to the other alternatives.—(8)

‘*From among these*’—from among the four kinds of householders, one
having a granary full of grains, and so forth,—‘*one follows the six
occupations*;’ *i.e*., the person with vast responsibilities described
above, follows all the six occupations.—“Which are these?”—These arc—(1)
gleanings, (2) pickings, (3) earning by begging, (4) earning without
begging, (5) agriculture and trade; ‘teaching,’ officiating at
sacrifices’ and ‘receiving gifts’ being included under ‘earning by
begging, and without begging.’ The man with a large family should have
recourse to all these occupations, for the due fulfilment of his daily
work; in fact he may have recourse to even agriculture and trade.

Some people explain the ‘six occupations’ of the present context as
standing for—‘Teaching, studying’ and the rest mentioned in Discourse I
(88). But this explanation is in-compatible with the context \[since
*Study, offering of sacrifices* and *making gifts* can nut be ‘means of
livelihood’\]; and further, there would be no point in prescribing
*study* and the rest here, they having been already enjoined elsewhere
(in 1.88 and in 10.75).

‘*Another*’—the second, who possesses a jar full of corns—‘*lives by
three*;’ the prefix ‘*pra*’ in ‘*pravartate*’ is superfluous;
‘*pravartate*’ standing for ‘*vartate*.’ Any three occupations of those
mentioned are meant here,—with the exception of Agriculture and Trade.

The person possessing only a jar full of corns is more commendable than
the former. Since it is going to be declared later on that—‘this means
of living has been deprecated by the good;’ this with reference to the
‘tending of cattle, trade,’ and so forth (8.102). Gautama has mentioned
(10.5-6)

‘Agriculture and Trade, not carried on by oneself, and money-lending’ as
permissible in normal times. But even when one carries on trade and
agriculture, not by oneself, but through others,—there is something
improper in this also; though the impropriety may be a small one.

‘*One lives with two*.’—Here also, leaving off ‘earning by begging,’ any
two of the six may be adopted. The acquiring of wealth *without begging*
also is permissible only to the extent of what may suffice for three
days.

‘*The fourth lives by Brahmasattra*.’—‘*Brahmasattra*’ stands for either
one of the two, ‘picking’ and ‘gleaning.’ These means of living are
called ‘*sattra*’ (Sacrificial Session), because they are carried on
continuously and are not to be finished on any one day. For this reason
they are called ‘*sattra*,’ specially as they have to be carried on
every day. The term ‘*brahma*’ is synonymous with ‘*Brāhmaṇas*;’ the
meaning being that this is a sacrifical session for Brāhmaṇas. From the
use of this term ‘*brahma*’ here, it follows that all that has been said
before this regarding the means of living, pertains to ‘*Brāhmaṇas*;’
those pertaining to the *Kṣatriya* and others will be described on
various occasions.

*Question*—“How can any living be possible by *pickings* and *gleanings*
alone? since it is only during the autumn and the summer that it is
possible for ears of corns to fall either in fields or in harvest-yards,
it might be said that ‘the man would earn summer-grains from the
summer-harvests, and the autumnal grains from the autumnal harvests.’
But in this way the man would have to collect grains lasting for six
months; and he could never be ‘one who does not possess enough for the
morrow.’ It might be argued that—‘it would be possible for the man to
pick and glean grains that may have fallen here and there (even apart
from harvesting).’ This is true; but the grain collected in this fashion
could never suffice for feeding.—‘When the man is picking and gleaning,
just as he will have collected enough, he will eat; it being impossible
for him to make a collection for five or more days. In the Mahābhārata,
the person who eats at the end of a fortnight has been called ‘one who
lives by pickings and gleanings which means that, under such
circumstances, the Householder has become the Hermit.’—But even so, this
would be incompatible with the character of ‘one who does not possess
enough for the morrow;’ as, under the circumstances mentioned, the man
would be ‘one who lives upon whatever he obtains,’ and *not*‘ one who
does not possess enough for the morrow.’ That man is called ‘one who
does not possess enough for the morrow,’ who earns everyday just enough
for the day, and spends it all on the same day, and does not keep
anything for the next day. If the daily ‘picking and gleaning’ does not
suffice for his daily feeding, how could he be ‘one who does not possess
enough for the morrow?’ How could such a person live and maintain his
wife and children?”

It is in view of these difficulties that some people offer another
explanation of the Text beginning with the words ‘*another lives by
three*’:—‘*By three*’—*i.e*., by officiating at sacrifices, by teaching
and by receiving gifts.—‘*By two*’—*i.e*., by officiating at sacrifices
and by teaching; the ‘receiving of gifts’ being precluded in view of
what is said (in 10.109) regarding ‘the receiving of gifts being
demeaning.’—‘*Brahma* - *sattra*’ is *teaching*; and this would be
enough for a living. The person described (in 4.10) as ‘one who lives by
picking and gleaning, etc.,’ must be different from the four described
in the present text.

On this point, we offer the following explanation:—‘*The person living
by picking*’ is one who obtains from several persons—taking ten or
twelve barley grains from each—just enough to serve for the day; while
one who obtains from each person enough for the day is called ‘one
living by gleanings.’ In another *Smṛti* text, this means of living has
been called ‘*Yāyāvara*.’ in view of this, such livelihood may pertain
to all time. Nor would there be any incompatibility between the
performance of the *Vaiśvadeva* and other rites and the maintaining of
wife and children; as for purposes of the former, a very small quantity
would be taken out of the alms obtained.—(9)

‘*Ṣaṭkarma*’—Medhātithi is again misrepresented by Buhler. (See
*Translation*); the ‘six’ described by him are (1) ‘*uñcha*,’ (2)
‘*śila*,’ (3) ‘*ayācitalābha*,’ (4) ‘*yācitalābha*,’ (5) ‘*kṛṣi*’ and
(6) ‘*vāṇijya*’; and he adds that ‘Teaching, sacrificing for others and
receiving gifts’ are included under ‘*yācita-ayācitalābha*’—they are
those mentioned in verses 5 and 6, according to Govindarāja, which
agrees with Medhātithi;—those mentioned in 5 and 6, excepting ‘service’
and substituting in its place ‘money-lending,’ according to Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda;—according to Nārāyaṇa, those mentioned in verses 5 and 6,
and also those enumerated in 1.88;—those mentioned in 1. 88, according
to Nandana, which explanation Medhātithi notes and rejects.

‘*Tribhiḥ*’—Here also Buhler misrepresents Medhātithi; Medhātithi does
not restrict ‘three’ to the ‘first three mentioned in verses 5-6’; what
he clearly says is ‘any three out of those mentioned excepting
agriculture and trade’;—‘teaching, sacrificing and accepting gifts’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nandana);—‘teaching, sacrificing
and accepting gifts, as also the first three mentioned in verses 5-6’
(Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Dvābhyām*’—Here also what Medhātithi says is—*any* *two* out of the
three just recommended, excepting *gifts received for asking*—and not
‘gleaning and accepting voluntary gifts’ as stated by
Buhler;—‘sacrificing and teaching’ (Govindarāja Kullūka, Rāghavānanda
and Nandana);—‘gleaning ears and single grains’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Brahmasattra*’—‘Any one of the two, gleaning ears and gleaning single
grains’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘teaching’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka,
Rāghavānanda and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 169), which adds the following
notes:—‘*ṣaṭkarma*’ stands for the six occupations of sacrificing for
others, offering sacrifices and the rest, that have been recommended for
the Brāhmaṇa; and these are referred to for the purpose of prescribing
the three occupations of receiving gifts and the
rest;—‘*tribhiranyaḥ*’—*i*. *e*., for the ‘*kumbhīdhānya*’ also the
three occupations are enjoined;—‘*dvābhyām ekaḥ*’,—this permits
sacrificing and teaching for the *Tryahaihika*,—the receiving of gifts
being forbidden, as they may come from evil persons;—the fourth,
‘*Aśvastana*’ should live by ‘*Brahmasattra*’, *i. e*., teaching alone.
Thus it follows that the ‘*Kusūladhānya*’ and the rest are meant for the
Brāhmaṇa only; as the receiving of gifts and the rest are not possible
for any other caste.

*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.128) quotes the verse in support of the view that the
first refers to ‘sacrificing, teaching, receiving gifts, agriculture,
trade and cattle-tending,’—the second to ‘sacrificing, teaching and
receiving gifts,’—the third to ‘sacrificing and teaching’ and the fourth
to ‘teaching’ only.

The verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 216), which provides an
explanation more in keeping with Medhātithi’s:—The *Kusūladhyāna* has
six occupations,—viz. *uñcha*, *śila, ayācita, yācita, kṛṣi* and
*vāṇijya*;—the other, ‘*Kumbhīdhānya*’ lives by three—*i.e*., *uñcha,
śila* and *ayācita*;—the ‘*Tryahaihika*’ by two—*i.e., uñcha* and
*śila*;—and ‘*Aśvastanika*’ by the ‘*Brahmasattra*’ *i.e*., by the u *ñ*
cha alone, which leads him to the ‘regions of Brahman, and as such is
equal to the *Sattra sacrifice*.’

The verse is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II. p. 247), which
explains the ‘six occupations’ to be ‘sacrificing, teaching, receiving
gifts, agriculture, trade and cattle-tending;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 131), which explains the meaning as follows:—Some people live by the
six means—officiating at sacrifices, teaching, receiving gifts,
agriculture, trade and cattle-tending;—others by three only *viz*.,
receiving gifts, teaching and officiating at sacrifices; others by two
only *i.e*., by officiating at sacrifices and teaching; and others again
by one only, teaching; among these each succeeding one is superior to
the preceeding ones.

The term ‘*pārvāyaṇāntīyāḥ*’ is to be expound as ‘those pertaining to
the *Parvas* and the *Ayanāntas*;’—the term being formed with the
reflexive ‘aṇ’ and the correlative ‘*cha*’ (according to Pāṇini,
4.2.114).

‘Iṣṭi-sacritices pertaining to the *Parvas* (the moonless and the
full-moon days) are the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices; and that
‘pertaining to the solstices’ is the sacrifice called the ‘*Agrayaṇa*.’

The adding of ‘*only*’ precludes the voluntary sacrifices that are
performed with special ends in view. For the man here referred to, the
offering of the *Vaiśvadeva oblations* and the making of *Bali*
-offerings are not necessary every day; because he does not possess the
requisite amount of wealth. Hence the term ‘*only*’ precludes all the
more elaborate sacrifices.

“For that same reason, the *Agnihotra* also would not be possible for
the man; as wealth is needed for that also.”

Yes; but he could offer the fortnightly oblations.

“How would such a man maintain his wife?”

She also will have recourse to the same means of living (*i.e*., picking
and gleaning). In the event of the wife being disabled and unable to
carry on this method of livelihood, the husband would not be entitled to
the performance of the *Agnihotra* (or to the livelihood by pickings and
gleanings).

“How would the wife, in such cases, manage to live, when the man would
be keeping the *Cāndrāyaṇa* and such other fasts and observances?”

There is no room for this question, in face of the direction that ‘the
wife shall eat what is left by the guest and others.’

“In the event of the man not being able to offer the *Vaiśvadeva*
-offerings, the wife could not live upon her own private property; as it
has been laid down that both husband and wife shall live upon
‘remnants,’ Hence, the man shall make the *Vaiśvadeva* -offerings with
the help of his wife’s property; specially, as the use of the wife’s
property for religious purposes has been sanctioned by the scriptures.”

It is not so; under the circumstances mentioned, it is the *Agnihotra*,
and not the *Vaiśvadeva* -offering, that is religiously binding.

Or, even granting what you say. How would that woman live who has no
private property of her own?

From all this it follows that the man, whose wife is disabled, is not
entitled to have recourse to the ‘picking and gleaning’ method of
livelihood.

‘*Living*’—maintaining himself.—(10)

That is called the ‘*worldly way*’ which is followed by ordinary people
wanting in moral strength;—such methods, for instance, as those of
hypocrisy and flattery—(describing the man from whom something is to be
gained as) ‘you are Viṣṇu, you are Brahmā! May you conquer and live
long!’ and so forth,—and also of reciting pleasing and jocular stories.

‘*For the sake of subsistence*.’—What is mentioned here should not be
done for the purpose of making a living; there is no harm in its being
done by way of politeness.

‘*Straightforward*.’—The man whose exterior is different from the
interior, is called ‘dishonest,’ ‘not straightforward;’ such a person.is
of a jealous temperament and shows it to persons who speak disagreeable
words to him.

‘*Sincere*.’—That man is called ‘insincere,’ ‘hypocritical,’ who
performs the *Agnihotra*, for obtaining popularity and thereby receiving
presents and gifts, and not with a view to carrying out the scriptural
injunctions regarding it.

Though ‘straightforwardness’ and the rest are qualities belonging to the
soul, yet they are here figuratively attributed to the ‘Life.’

‘*Straightforward, sincere and pure*’— The ‘purity’ here meant consists
in its not being mixed up with the two methods of livelihood described
above, and also in its being free from the aforesaid defects.

Though what was meant could be conveyed by means of only one of the
three words, yet, in view of metrical exigencies, the author has made
use of three words; such, use being analogous to such expressions as
‘*go-balīvarda*’ (where the *go* is the same as the *balīvarda*).

How can there be any such expression as ‘*live the life of the
Brāhmaṇa*,’ ‘*Brāhmaṇajīvikām jīvet*, ‘when the root *to live* is
intransitive? Why, too, should the same root (*to live, jīva*) be used
twice (once in ‘*jīvet*’ and again in ‘*jīvikām*’)? Certainly, the
relation of cause and effect is never found to be expressed by such
expressions, as ‘*gamanam gacchet*,’ ‘should *go* the *going*.’”

Our answer is as follows:—The relation of cause and effect is based upon
the relation of general and particular, and hence there is nothing
incongruous in this. We have such usage in expressions like ‘*aśvapoṣam*
*puṣṭaḥ*,’ ‘fattened like the fattening of the horse,’ Further, the root
‘*jīva*,’ ‘to live,’ also denotes the act of *living* as part of the act
of *acting up to* the *performance*; and in this sense it is
*transitive* also. So that there is nothing objectionable in the
expression used; the term ‘*jīvet*,’ ‘*should live*,’ being explained as
*should act up to*,’ for the sake of subsistence.—(11)

With a view to laying stress upon the importance of the two means of
living—‘to collect grains for three days’ and ‘not to possess grains
enough for the morrow,’—the author adds this verse by way of reflection.

One should have recourse to contentment; that is, one should not make an
effort to go about begging on a large scale, with a view to becoming
dependent upon several persons.

‘*He who wants happiness should remain
self-controlled*.’—‘*Self-control*’ consists in not wanting more wealth
than what would suffice for bare subsistence.

‘Contentment’ is the root of happiness for all high-minded persons; and
its opposite—*i.e*., Discontent—is the root of unhappiness; the
non-accomplishment of what is desired being a source of great
humiliation for the learned. For these reasons, one should have recourse
to contentment.—(12)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*means of livelihood*’ stands for the rule regarding
subsistence. Hence, ‘*by any one*’ does not imply that the man’s life
should be entirely dependent upon that one; because the rules do not say
that he who has recourse to one living should not have recourse to
another. It is for this reason,too, that the mail subsisting by a number
of means of living, or the man who has inherited his father’s property
(and hence does not stand in need of the modes of living just
described), does not cease to be entitled to the keeping of the
observances. If this were not so, then it would be absolutely necessary
for the man to adopt only *one* mode of living.

‘*These observances*.’—‘Observance’ means *mental determination*, in the
form—‘such and such an act is enjoined by the scriptures,—I should do
this—or I should not do that.’

‘*Conducive to heaven, longevity and fame*.’— Some people have held that
this mentions the results actually following from the keeping of the
observances; and hence it is only persons desiring these results, that
have to keep the observances.

This, however, is not right. As if this were so, then the observances
would cease to be obligatory; and this would be incompatible with the
term ‘*nitya*,’ ‘daily,’ ‘always,’ occurring in the next verse. Further,
the Veda has indicated the obligatory character of these
observances:—‘By not keeping these, one becomes beset with sin,’
Further, if Heaven and the rest were construed as something desired,
they could not attain the position of being qualifications of the
persons entitled to the observances.—(13)

‘*Prescribed in the Veda*.’—This is said in view of the fact that the
Smṛtis are all based upon the Veda.

‘*His own duty*.’—Consisting of the host of observances going to be
described. Being prescribed for him, they are called ‘*his own*.’

‘*Should always perform*.’—*i e*., as long as he lives.

‘*Without sloth*’—*i.e*., free from laziness.

By doing this—*i.e*., by keeping the observances,—‘*to the best of his
ability*;’—this implies that one is to perform just what he has the
strength to perform. It is in view of this that it has been declared
that—‘one may also observe all this mentally only.’

‘*Highest state*’—*i.e*., attainment of Brahman.—(14)

‘*Clinging pursuits*’ are those to which people become addicted; just as
singing and music; to these passionate persons *cling*, as it were.

‘*Nor when wealth*’—enough for subsistence—‘*is already there*’—having
been inherited from father and others;—one shall not seek for more,

‘*Even in times of distress, not from here and there*.’—As a rule, one

‘*Sensual objects*.’— Objects of sense, colour, taste, and the rest; —
‘*to these he shall not become addicted*,’—*i.e*., he shall not attend
to them too much. Lovely young girls, sounds of flute and music, sweet
taste, perfumes of camphor and other things, loving touch,—all these one
shall not enjoy over much.

‘*Through desire*’—*i.e*., by reason of the predominating influence of
desire.

In regard to all these, one should keep one’s own enjoyment under proper
check; just in the same manner as one keeps one’s desire for wealth
under check, by. restricting one’s earning? only to what one gets
without begging.

‘*Excessive addiction to these*.’—This points out the method of
restraining one’s desires. Attachment to objects cannot be checked by
the mind; it can be checked by reflecting upon them as inimical to one’s
best interests. At first, one should not seek to obtain them; and when
they do come to one, and one has enjoyed them once, one should reflect
upon the following facts relating to them:—These are such that in a
moment they cease to be agreeable,—they are transient,—they are
forbidden by the scriptures,—attachment to them leads to hell, and so
forth. This is what has been already said under 2.96 above.—(16)

‘*Vayasaḥ*,’ ‘*with age*,’— the genitive ending denotes relationship
to^(‘)conformity.’

‘*Veṣavāgbuddhi*.’—this is a copulative compound.

‘*Sārūpyam*.’—the affix ‘*ṣyan*’ has the reflexive force.

Thus the meaning comes to be as follows:—

Dress and the rest should be kept in due conformity with age and other
things.

‘*Sārūpya*,’ means here *conformity*, *compatibility*; any other kind of
‘*Sārūpya*,’ ‘similarity,’—such as that of figure and the like—being
impossible in this case.

‘*Dress’ stands* for the disposition of the hair, of ornaments, and so
forth. Fop instance, during boy-hood, hair is to be worn in tufts;
during youth, it shall be worn in curls and such other shapes; while in
old age it shall be either worn clotted, or shall be clean shaven.

‘*Speech*’ also should be in conformity with age. Similarly,
‘*thoughts*’ also; that is, during early life the man should think of
the triad (of wealth, pleasure and religious merit); but as he grows
old, his thoughts should rest mainly on Religious Merit.

Dress should also be in conformity with one’s occupation, as also with
one’s wealth; it should be in conformity with one’s family also. So that
such things as painting of the teeth and dressing of the hair, etc.,
even though otherwise flagrant, cease to be so when they are in keeping
with one’s occupation etc.

It has been said that the present verse deals with ordinary worldly
activity. That is to say, it does not lay down an Injunction;—the
injunctive portion of it having been already got out from other sources.
All that the verse does is to describe the ordinary usage of the world;
the sense being that if one behaves in accordance with this, one follows
the ways of the world, and hence does not become unpopular among
men.—(18)
