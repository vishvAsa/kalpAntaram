The ‘gift’ here meant is what one obtains from another person, who gives
it with a view to some transcendental reward. Even though one may *be*‘
*entitled*’—*i.e*., fit—to accept such a gift, one shall avoid getting
into the habit of doing it again and again. The ‘*title*’ or ‘fitness’
here meant consists in being endowed with an excellence of learning,
study, and character, and possessing full knowledge of things and laws.
Hence, what is stated in the second half of the verse is only the
reiteration of what has been said above regarding the ignorant person
fearing etc. (191)—(186).

‘Without *knowing*, etc.’—One shall not accept gifts merely for the
purpose of enjoying pleasures, etc. The meaning is that one shall accept
gifts only for the maintaining of one’s family, and for the due
accomplishment of ones obligatory duties,—and for no other purpose.

‘*Even though he may be pining with hunger*.’—That is, if, without
accepting the gift, he should suffer emaciation; ‘emaciation’ standing
for non-development of the body.

Or, we may construe the passage as ‘*dravyāṇām vidhim dharmyam
pratigrahe*.—What is the ‘*dharmaya vidhi*,’ ‘the legal injunction?’—It
would consist in the full knowledge of the purpose, the deity, the
*mantra* and other details connected with the gift; such as—‘Gold is
given in honour of Agni, the cow in honour of Rudra,’ and so
forth.—(187)

He who has not performed any austerities and who does not study the
Veda:—this ‘studying’ stands for the full knowledge of the Veda, which
is what has been referred to in the text. Both these qualifications
combined are necessary for entitling a man to receive gifts.

He who does not possess these two qualifications, and yet hankers after
gifts, ‘*sinks along with* *him*;’—with whom?—Since no other person is
mentioned, and the *giver* is the person mentioned in close proximity to
the present context, it follows that it is along with the giver that the
receiver sinks. The giver has recourse to the Recipient, for the purpose
of crossing over (to heaven); if, therefore, the recipient happen to be
unqualified, he makes both himself and the giver sink into water; just
as the ‘*stone-raft*,’—the raft made of stone—does in water. ‘*Raft*’ is
that by which people cross rivers, such as boat and other things. One
who gets on a piece of stone for crossing a river sinks into the water
along with the stone-raft; in the same manner, the giver of gifts to the
unqualified Brāhmaṇa, and the Brāhmaṇa receiving the gifts,—both go to
hell.—(l 90).

The duties of the Receiver having been described, the Text proceeds to
describe those of the Giver.

The term, ‘*even*,’ precludes the giving of all things; when even water
is prohibited, how can anything else be given to the man? This is a
hyperbolical way of forbidding the gift of other things. As for water
itself, there can be no prohibition regarding it, as it is of use to all
beings.

“It has been already said that one shall not honour, even with speech,
those who behave like cats (4.32).”

True; what is forbidden there, is the act: of honouring them; what is
forbidden here, is the offering of gifts to them; and these, the gifts
of wealth, not of anything else. Thus, both prohibitions become useful,
as is going to be asserted later on (193)—‘Property, though earned
according to law, etc.’ It is for this reason that the giving of *food*,
in a disrespectful manner, to heretics and others is not forbidden.

In this connection, some people argue as follows:—“Though the text has
mentioned the person ‘*ignorant of the Veda*,’ this should be taken to
include also the person *who is not studying the Veda*. Because all
interested gifts have been laid down as to be offered to only such
persons as are studying the Veda; and it is not right to put them on the
same footing as heretics.”

These persons should be asked the following question:—Where has it been
laid down that gifts are to be offered to only such persons as are
studying the Veda, and are still without full knowledge of it *?*

It might be said that this has been laid down in 3.128, where it is said
that—these things are to be given only to the *Śrotriya* (Vedic
student).

But, since the same passage contains the qualification ‘worthy’—and this
is not possible without *complete learning*,—the passage cannot refer to
the mere student still pursuing his studies. Specially, as we have such
other passages as—‘the fee shall be paid to a learned person’—which
occur in the same context as the passage quoted. Hence, by taking the
two passages together, it follows that gifts are to be offered to
persons possessed of both the qualifications. Thus we do not find any
ground for renouncing the direct meaning of the text.

As for the impropriety of the Vedic Student being put on the same
footing as heretics,—there can be no impropriety in what is directly
asserted by the text.

‘*Vaiḍālavratika*’ is one who behaves in the manner of a cat; and,
similarly, ‘*vakavratika*’ is one who has the maimers of a heron.

The Locative endings have been used because it is the idea of
*receptacle* that is meant to be conveyed. If the *recipient* were meant
to be expressed, the Dative would have been the right form to
use.—(192).

The term ‘property’ is meant to imply that the giving of *food* is not
forbidden.

‘*Though acquired by laicful means*,’—such as gifts from proper sources,

‘*Aupala*,’—made of stone.

‘*Raft*’— boat and such other contrivances used in crossing water.

He who ‘*crosses*’—proceeds to cross—water by such a raft, sinks down
into the water. So also do ‘*the ignorant giver and receiver*.’

The term, ‘*pratīcchaka*’ is to be explained as ‘*pratīcchām karoti*’
(with the *ṇich* affix), and then the nominal ‘*ṇvul*’ added to it.

‘*Pratīpsakaḥ*’ is another reading; this would be derived from the root
‘*āp,’ to obtain*, with the derivative affix, and then the nominal
‘*ṇvul*’ added to it. The meaning of both would be the same.—(194)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The two terms (‘*viḍalavratika*’ and ‘*vakavratika*’) are used
figuratively, and the grounds of such figurative use being multifarious,
that one is to be accepted, on the basis whereof the term may have been
used in a certain case. And it is necessary to Ascertain this exactly,
for the purpose of finding out definitely the exact import of the
prohibition.

He for whom his virtue is *like a flag*. The compound is in accordance
with Pāṇini 2. 1.56. It may also be taken as a *Karmadhāraya* compound,
the meaning being ‘the virtuous flag.’ The term, ‘*dharmadhvajī*’ thus
means, ‘he who has flag-like virtue,’ the word ending with the
possessive affix ‘*ṇini*.’ This name is applied to the man who performs
righteous acts only for the purpose of fame, and not because they are
prescribed in the scriptures, *i.e*., the person who perforins righteous
acts only in such places where people see them, and who advertises his
righteousness by his own agents, for the purpose of making himself known
as righteous, and hence succeeding in receiving gifts, etc.

‘*Covetous*,’— jealous and also miserly.

‘*Hypocrite*,’— the man who commits fraud on the people.

‘*Cheat*,’— he who behaves deceitfully. ‘Cheating’ is deceit. The person
who is ostentatiously righteous, while in secret he steals what is
guarded and makes known what should be kept secret, people think him to
be a avirtuous man and, believing that a secret entrusted to him cannot
leak out, convey to him some secret of theirs; and in the end, this
secret becomes divulged to just that person from whom it was intended to
be kept. This is a form of injuring others.

‘*The traducer of all persons*,’—he who cannot bear the good qualities
of others, and hence calumniates them. ‘*Abhisandhaka*’ is formed
according to Pāṇini 3. 1. 136, and then the reflexive ‘*ka*’ and
‘*sarvābhisandhaka*’ is a Genitive Tatpuruaṣa compound.

Such a person is to be known as ‘*one who behaves like a cat*’ a
‘*viḍalavratika*.’

At this place, some people read the following verse (in the text):—

*When a man’s flag of virtue is ever raised*, *like Indra’s flag, and
his sins are hidden,—this is the behaviour called “cat-like*;”
(195A)—and this states, in brief, what has been stated in the foregoing
text (195).

The presence of even one of the qualities mentioned, marks out the man
as one of cat-like behaviour; and that this is so is inferred from the
verse just quoted. The clause, ‘whose sins are hidden,’ does not
specifically mention any particular sin, and all the sins mentioned (in
195) are equally ‘sins;’ and thus, by means of these two verses, the
same fact has been brought home to the pupils by the Teacher. Some of
the pupils were taught the former verse (195) and some the present one
(195A); both are equally authoritative. Thus then, when it is asserted
that ‘Devadatta is one who is wearing the armlet and the ear-ring, with
fat shoulders and full chest,’—where all the qualifications are
recognised as collectively distinguishing Devadatta,—yet, in the case in
question, each of the qualifications serves singly to distinguish the
man of ‘cat-like behaviour.’—(195).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘Looking downwards’ is a mark of ‘heron-like behaviour.’ Or, the term,
‘*adhodṛṣṭih*’ may mean ‘whose ideas are ‘*nīca*,’ *i.e., mean*; he who
is ever ready to do anything, who accepts gifts even from the lowest
persons.

‘*Niṣkṛti*’ is cruelty; he, in whom this is the principal factor, is
called ‘*niṣkṛtika*,’ ‘cruel,’ he who talks in an improper manner.

‘*Falsely humble*,’—who shows himself to be extremely gentle and
harmless, but, in actual practice, turns out to be most harmful. For
example, the cat pretends to be asleep, when intent upon catching its
prey; similarly, the person whose righteousness is mingled with deceit,
has been called ‘*a man of cat-like behaviour*.’ So also with the
expression, ‘*of heron-like behaviour*:’ When seeking to catch fish,
herons pretend to show as if they were taking no notice of the creatures
in water, and yet all the time they are intent upon catching the fish.

The term ‘*vrata*’ denotes *habit*.

It has been shown above how there is no repetition in the several parts
of the verses. Even if there were some real repetitions, there would be
nothing wrong in this, as the verses contain definitions (of two
distinct characters); and the repeated assertions make the fact more
easily intelligible.

“What is the difference between the *cat-like* and the *heron-like*
behaviour!”

We explain as follows:—The latter (one who is *heron-like*) is bent upon
accomplishing his own ends, he does not thwart the purposes of other
men; while the former (one who is *cat-like*), thwarts the purpose of
other people, through sheer jealousy, even though his own interests be
not served by it—(196).
