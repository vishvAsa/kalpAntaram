What is said here has already been said before; it is reiterated here
for the purpose of laying down the additional details that follow.

‘*No guest shall dwell in his house unhonoured*.’—That is, all guests
should be lodged in the house after being honoured.

‘*To the best of his ability*.’— One or two, or several,—as many as can
he duly honoured—shall be honoured with seat and other things. What is
meant is that when guests are living in one’s house, all these things
should be provided for them, in a respectful manner; it does not mean
that one should give away one’s proprietary right over all these
articles in.the house. Since ‘fruits and roots’ have been mentioned
separately, it follows that these are to be given only in the event of
other kinds of food, in the shape of rice, juice, meat and butter, being
not available.—(29)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.21.1).—‘In the absence of all else, a place,
water, agreeable speech,—at least these should not fail towards one who
resides in his house; one should eat what has been left by the guests;
no such sweet dishes should one eat in his house as have not been
partaken of by the guest.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.26-27).—‘Though breathing, he does not live who makes no
offerings to gods, guests, dependents, Pitṛs and his own self. The
Religious Student, the Renunciate and the Hermit derive their sustenance
from the Householder; hence when these happen to arrive at one’s house,
he shall not disregard them.’

Do. (67.30, 40, 42, 43).—‘One shall not permit a guest to live in the
house without feeding him. The foolish man who eats food without
offering it to these knows not that he is himself being devoured by dogs
and vultures. After that the husband and wife shall eat what remains.
The Householder shall eat what is left after offerings have been made to
gods, Pitṛs, men, dependents and the household-deities. The food
prescribed for the good consists in the remnant of the sacrificial
offering.’

Do. (67.32-33).—‘Never without having given; never without pouring the
oblation into fire.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.249.5, 7, 12, 13).—‘One shall not have food cooked for
himself alone; one shall not needlessly kill animals;—no Brāhmaṇa should
reside in his house, without being honoured and fed. He shall always
feed upon *Vighasa* and upon *Amṛta—Amṛta* being the remnant of
sacrifices; and the eating of it is like the eating of sacrificial food.
He who eats what has been left after all dependents have been fed is
said to *feed on Vighasa*.’

‘*Pāṣaṇḍinaḥ*’—‘Ascetics who wander about with external marks, such as
nakedness, red-dresses, and so forth’ (Medhātithi, who does not explain
the term as ‘non-brahmanical ascetics,’ as asserted by Buhler,—and also
Govindarāja);—‘Śākyas, Bhikṣus, Kṣapaṇakas and other ascetics outside
the Vedic pale’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘those who do not believe in the
Vedas’ (Rāghavānanda). The ‘*vāhyaliṅgin*’ does not mean, as Hopkins
says, ‘those who bear the token of outcastes’; what is really meant is
the person who, without possessing any real asceticism of the heart,
*makes a show of it, by wearing external marks*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 170), which explains
‘*vikarmasthān*’ as ‘those addicted to such acts as are forbidden—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on l. 130), which explains ‘*haituka*’ as ‘one who, by
argumentation, raises doubts about everything’, — ‘*pāṣaṇḍinaḥ*’ as
‘those-who have recourse to such life-conditions as are opposed to the
dictates of the Vedas—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 319).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Yājñavalkya* (1.130).—‘One should always exclude the hypocrite, the
logician, the impostor and those who behave like the heron.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Aparārka, p. 171).—‘The man who transgresses all
laws laid down in the Śruti and the Smṛti, relating to the division of
castes and life-stages, and acts as he likes, relying upon false
reasonings, addicted to evil deeds, deluded with overweening opinion of
his own reasoning powers, is the Pāṣaṇḍin, wicked, fit for hell, the
lowest of men. With such men and with the Vaiḍālavratas one shall never
have any intercourse.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Do.).—\[Same as Manu.\]

... *Answer*:—The term has been added for the purpose of laying stress
upon the fact that those persons are meant who still keep up their study
of the Veda.

‘*Householders*.’—This does not mean that the mendicant, the ascetic and
the student are not to be honoured; all that is meant is that, since all
these live upon *alms*, they cannot be regarded as ‘guests;’ especially
as the student cannot dwell anywhere else except at his teacher’s house,
and the ascetic cannot dwell away from the forests. For the Renunciate
also, dwelling in villages is not possible, since it has been distinctly
declared that ‘he shall go to the village only when seeking for alms’
(Gautama, 3. 14). From all this it follows that, in view of the fact
that persons in the other stages of life live in places other than
‘households,’—even though it be somehow possible for them to have the
character of ‘guests,’—what is said here can apply to *householders*
only, *as a rule*.

‘*With offerings to Gods, and to Pitṛs*.’—That is, these persons are to
be received and honoured at the performance of rites in honour of Gods
and of Pitṛs.

‘*Otherwise*.’—Those who are not ‘accomplished,’ should be avoided, even
though they be free from the aforesaid defects (described in 30).—(31)

*Laghuśātātapa* (78, 83).—‘If, in the matter of feeding and gifts, one
ignores a Brāhmaṇa Student who may happen to be at hand, he destroys his
family up to the seventh generation. If a Vedic Scholar, accomplished in
the Veda, in learning and in observances, come to one’s house, all the
vegetables become delighted at the prospect of reaching the highest
state.’

*Bṛhad-Yama* (42, 43).—‘The man who is free from jealousies, who is of
good character, a Vedic Scholar cognisant of Brahman, young and endowed
with learning and modesty is the proper recipient, the best of the
twice-born. He who is conversant with the Vedanta, who is Jyeṣṭhasāman,
free from avarice, devoted to the Veda, is the person who should be
employed with special effort in the rites offered to gods and Pitṛs.’
