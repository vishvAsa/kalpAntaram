This is supplementry to the prohibition of Injury in general.

‘*Unrighteousness*’ consists in doing acts forbidden by the scriptures,
such as incest, and the like; and the man who does such acts is
‘*unrighteous*.’

‘*He whose wealth is mis-begotten*,’—*i.e*., he who acquires wealth in
the form of bribes offered for telling lies at legal proceedings, etc.

‘*He who is addicted to injuring*,’—he who always seeks to injure
others, either through enmity, or for fulfilling some other purpose.

Such a man does not obtain happiness in this world.—(170).

‘*Dharma*,’ ‘Right,’ consists in the bounds of propriety laid down in
the scriptures;—one who acts according to this,—even though he may
‘suffer’ failure—‘*shall not turn his mind towards unrighteousness*.’
Because, even though unrighteous men may be found to have become rich by
wealth acquired by bribery, hypocrisy, and the like,—yet very soon their
‘*overthrow*’—in the form of destruction of their wealth, etc.—is found
to come about. Consequently, one should never deviate from the right.

The Author has, in a friendly spirit, shown us a visible instance.—(171)

appropriation of what belongs to others,—‘*adharmikāṇām*’, of those who
do not perform the prescribed duties,—‘*pāpānām*,’ of those who do what
is forbidden,—‘*viparyayam*,’ loss of wealth and other things,—‘*āśu*’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The Author now proceeds to describe the sense of the scriptures.

What is said here is in view of the fact that the acts mentioned in the
Vedas as leading to good and evil results, are uncertain in regard to
the time of their fruition.

‘*Unrighteousness, practised*, *does not bring its fruit immediately*.’

All that is mentioned in the Veda is that the acts prescribed bring good
results, and those forbidden bring evil results; the exact time of
fruition is not mentioned. Even though the verbal operation of the Vedic
texts rests with indicating that a certain act *shall be done*, yet it
ends in indicating the relation between an act and the results accruing
therefrom; but it does not say anything regarding the time of the
fruition of the acts done, with a view to obtaining certain results; as
for the obligatory acts, that they *shall be done* follows from their
very nature;—lastly, in regard to the avoiding of the forbidden act
also, the persons entitled to this are not only those who are desirous
of avoiding the sufferings of hell, etc., but all those who are desirous
of abiding by the scriptures. And what the scriptural prohibition does
is to intimate that the doing of the forbidden act results in suffering.
A full discussion of this subject will prolong our work to an undue
length. Hence we stop here.

‘*Gauriva*’—‘like the Earth (or the Cow).’—The example cited here is
meant to be both (*a*) ‘similar’ and (*b*) ‘dissimilar.’ (*a*) The
Earth, on having the seed sown in it, does not immediately bring forth
the sheaves of corn; in fact, it requires gradual development; similar
is the case with the Vedic act; this is the similarity (between the
*act* and the *Earth*). (*b*) Through dissimilarity also—the animal,
*cow*, on being milked, brings its fruit (milk) immediately; *not so*
Virtue and Vice.

Though the text mentions ‘unrighteousness’ only, yet what is meant is to
show the uncertainty of time regarding the fruition of ‘*righteousness*’
also.

‘*Accumulating*’—gaining strength in time;—‘*of the actor*’—of the
perpetrator of the act—‘*cuts off*’— destroys—‘*the roots*.’

The *cutting off of the root* indicates total annihilation. Just as when
the roots are cut off, trees do not grow again; similarly, the practice
of unrighteousness also.—(172)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Gauḥ*’—Buhler is again unfair to Medhātithi. Both Medhātithi and
Kullūka take this term ‘*gauḥ*’ precisely as Buhler says ‘it is not
impossible’. (See *Translation*.) From what Buhler says, Govindarāja,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana take ‘*gauḥ*’ only as ‘the *Cow*, which at once
yields its benefits by its milk &c.’ This verse is quoted in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68), which says that, if the ‘*gauḥ*’ is
taken as an example *per* similarity, then it means ‘earth’,—the earth
does not produce the harvest immediately after sowing of seeds; if it is
taken as ‘cow’, then it is an example *per* dissimilarity, the meaning
being ‘the cow gives its products, in the shape of milk &c. immediately,
not so *sin*, which takes time to fructify.’

172	Unrighteousness, practised in this world, does not at once produce its fruit, like a cow; but, advancing slowly, it cuts off the roots of him who committed it.

If not on himself, then on his sons,—if not on his sons, then on his grandsons (falls the punishment); an unrighteousness, once committed, never fails to bring its consequences to the perpetrator.—(173)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

“It is not right that the consequences of acts done by one person should
be described as falling on others. As a matter of fact, all Vedic acts
bring their fruits to the person who performs them. The principle of the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice (whereby the fruits of the sacrifice accrue to
the son of the performer) cannot be held to be applicable to the present
case, as there is no direct assertion to that effect. In connection with
the acts dealt with in the present context, there is no assertion to the
effect that their consequences accrue to the performer’s son.”

True; but when the son suffers pain, it causes the father still greater
pain; so that, in that case also, the resultant suffering would fall
upon the perpetrator himsef (himself?). As regards the son also, the
said suffering may be said to come to him by virtue of some past misdeed
of his son; and there would be nothing incongruous in this.

The same holds good regarding ‘*grandsons*’ also.

‘*Kṛto-dharmaḥ*.’—Whether the component words be read as
‘*Kṛtaḥ-dharmaḥ*’ or ‘*Kṛtaḥ-adharmaḥ*,’ the resultant conjunct form
would be the same—‘*Kṛto-dharmaḥ*;’ hence both *dharma* (righteousness)
and *adharma* (unrighteousness) are meant to be spoken of (as not
failing in bringing up their consequences)—(173).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Medhātithi* (P. 356, l. 20)—‘*Vaiśvānaranyāyaḥ*’—This refers to
*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra*, 4.38 *et. seq*, where it is stated that though the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice is performed by the Father, yet its results
accrue to the Son.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68)—which adds
‘*Kṛtodharmaḥ*’ should be construed as ‘*Kṛtaḥ adharma*’, as the context
deals with *Adharma*,—‘*na* *niṣphalaḥ*,’ *i.e*., unless it is expiated.

‘*Through unrighteousness*,’—such as causing injury to his master, and

‘*For a time*,’—for the time being only.

Then, ‘*for a while*’—after having gained riches and lands,—‘*he
experiences*’—enjoys—‘*good things*;’—*i.e*., such signs of prosperity
as the presence of many servants, the possession of cattle, horses, and
so forth.

Then, ‘*he conquers his enemies*’—*i.e*., ill-treats such persons as are
poor. What are meant by ‘enemies’ are those persons who, remaining firm
in the path of righteousness, do not have recourse to questionable means
of livelihood; and, in comparison to a rich person, the poverty of such
men would involve a certain amount of *insult*.

Having remained thus for some time, such persons become destroyed ‘*root

‘*Truthfulness*,’—the habit of saying things just as they are seen.

‘*Law*,’—Injunctions and Prohibitions contained in the Veda.

Though Truthfulness also would be involved under ‘law,’ yet it has been
mentioned separately, with a view to emphasize its special importance.

The fact of the matter is that ‘untruthfulness’ being the very nature of
men, it is forbidden again and again with special emphasis.

‘*Right conduct*,’—the conduct of good men. ‘Good men’ are those that
are cultured; and the ‘conduct’ or course of action adopted by them.

In all these, ‘*he shall delight*.’ ‘Delight’ is *satisfaction*. Hence,
what the text enjoins is satisfaction with those just enumerated; the
sense being that ‘he should show satisfaction of mind at the sight of
all right forms of activity.’

‘*Pupils*,’—wife, son, slaves and students; these should be governed
‘*in accordance with law*;’ the law being what has been laid down in
this connection under 8.299, *et seq*.

‘*With his speech, amis and belly duly controlled*.’— Whether there be
necessity or not, if *one* does not speak much, this is what is called
‘control of speech.’ The ‘control of arms’ consists in not causing pain
to others by the strength of one’s arms. The ‘control of belly’ consists
in non-gluttony, not eating too much;—gluttony consisting in eating much
at other people’s houses, with special zest for a particular article of
food.

What has been already said before, is repeated over and over again,
because wholesome advice is to be given at all times. This is the
explanation of all repetitions.—(175)

It has been said above that the ‘group of three’ constitutes the ‘ends
of man.’ Some people might think that all the three are equally
important, and argue as follows and act accordingly Righteous acts, like
the Jyotiṣṭoma, &c., are found to be performed at the cost of wealth and
pleasure. Such acts lead to loss of wealth by the giving away of the
sacrificial fee and other gifts; and they are opposed to pleasure,
inasmuch as it has been laid down that the person initiated for
sacrifices shall remain continent, and so forth. Exactly in the same
manner, it would be right to have recourse to the acquisition of wealth
and pleasure at the cost of righteousness, so that the prohibition, ‘One
shall not injure any living beings,’ forbids only such injury as one
might inflect upon others simply on account of enmity, and not that
which brings to the person wealth or pleasure.”

It is with a view to preclude such ideas that the text declares
that—‘*He shall avoid such wealth and pleasure*’ as involve opposition
to righteousness.

Having thus emphasized the superior importance of Righteousness, he
proceeds to add that, in some cases, righteous acts also have to be
avoided—‘*also righteousness if it be conducive to unhappiness*.’
‘Udarka’ means *sequence*; that whose sequence is unhappy is
‘*asukhodarka*.’ For instance, some people give away their entire
property, and obtain the fame of being an ‘extremely righteous and
charitable person;’—or, when, even on solitary river-banks, where many
ordinary persons see what is being done, people bathe, not so much for
acquiring spiritual merit, but for winning the praise of the
populace;—or, again, when large gifts are made to the ‘crows of sacred
places’ (the Brāhmaṇas, at these places, who hanker after gifts), for
the purpose of advertising their, powers of giving. All such acts are
deprecated.

Or, again (one should avoid), such acts as are ‘*disapproved by the
people*,’ as being blameworthy; *e.g*., the killing (at sacrifices) of
the bull, which should not be killed; and the act of eating its flesh is
more blameworthy than that of eating other kinds of flesh.

This prohibition is with a view to perceptible results, just like the
prohibition of touching a snake. Ordinary men, being ignorant, would not
know that the killing of the bull is permitted (under special
conditions), and would therefore make it known that the sacrificer of
the bull is an unrighteous person; and, as a large majority of men are
illiterate, even cultured persons, not caring to investigate the source
of the popular opinion, would avoid the person (as unrighteous). This is
what has been said in the passage—‘the king being righteous,’ etc.,
etc..

What we have said above, is in accordance with the explanation provided
by older writers. As a matter of fact, however, it can never be right to
reject, on the strength of *Smṛti*, what has been enjoined by the Veda.
The right example of the act aimed at by the Text is as follows: The
custom of ‘*niyoga*’ (‘begetting of a child on the widowed
sister-in-law’) is sanctioned by Smṛtis; but it is not performed,
because it is ‘deprecated by the people;’ or, again, when one is
supporting an unprotected young woman, entirely through pity,—if people
show their disapproval by giving out that ‘she appeals to hiś generosity
because she is a woman,’—then the said righteous act of supporting would
be one that is ‘deprecated by the people.’—(176)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 159);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 11), which would restrict the rule to only such ‘*dharma*’
as is ‘*dṛṣṭārtha*’, ‘prescribed for the purpose of perceptible worldly
results.’

*Viṣṇu* (71.84.85).—‘Wealth and Pleasure, opposed to Righteousness (he
shall avoid);—also such Righteousness as may be disapproved by the
people.’

*Āpastamba* (7.20.22).—‘He shall enjoy such pleasures as are not
incompatible with righteousness.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.156).—‘In act, mind and speech he shall carefully do
what is right; and he shall not do what is right if it happens to he
such as is not conducive to heaven, or disapproved by the people.’

*Gautama* (9.47).—‘While wearing shoes, he shall avoid eating, sitting,
accosting and saluting.’

*Śukranīti* (3.4-5).—‘He shall not try to attain liberation without
trying to attain the other three purposes, and he shall follow the path
of liberation without disregarding the other three. This is the golden
mean.’

The compound in ‘*pāṇipādacapalaḥ*’ is the instrumental *Tatpuruṣa*, in
accordance with Pāṇini’s Sūtra 2.1.30. The ‘fickleness’ of the hand
would consist in the picking up or removing of useless things.

The ‘fickleness’ of the eye would consist in looking at other women, or
at pictures, etc.

He shall not net or think in such a manner as would bring harm to
others.—(177).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 524), as setting
forth an epitome of what one’s ‘duty’ is;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (I., p.
695),—and again in II, p. 204, in connection with *tilaka* marks on the
forehead;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 275) to the effect that even when
living in foreign lands one should keep up the ways of his fathers;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1680);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 68), which says
that this refers to cases of optional alternatives only;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 71a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 9) to the effect that family-custom is to be regarded as a guide in
cases where there is a difference of opinion among the various
scriptural texts.
