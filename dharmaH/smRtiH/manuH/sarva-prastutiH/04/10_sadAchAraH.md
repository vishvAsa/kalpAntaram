<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Shall remain a Religious Student*.’—Abstention from congugal
intercourse is among the duties of the Religious Student; and it is this
that is meant here; and not the other duties of begging food, and so
forth. Specially, as the phrase ‘even during the season’ brings to mind
that one duty first of all.

Others hold that, during the days mentioned, the eating of honey and
meat is also meant to be avoided. In support of this view, it is
necessary to quote another *Smṛti-* text: ‘The use of oil, meat, the
female generative organ and the razor is to be avoided on the sixth, on
the Moonless Day, on the fourteenth of both fortnights and on the Full
Moon Day.’

Others, again, have offered the following explanation:—“‘Religious
Student’ is the name given to a person in a particular Life-stage;
hence, when it is applied to the Householder and persons in other
life-stages, it becomes simply indicative of that peculiar
characteristic of the Religious Student which consists in the
performance of duties conducive to Vedic Study; this is the case with
the expression, ‘should remain a Religious Student.’ When the name of
one thing is applied to another, it denotes *similarity*; and, in
accordance with this principle, the expression would mean the adoption
of all the duties of the Religious Student,—such as begging for food,
tending of the Fire, and so forth. But the presence of such directions
as, ‘all this should be done *till the ceremony of Return*’ (2.108), and
‘the Householder shall eat the remnants,’ clearly preclude the said
duties of ‘begging for food’ and the like (which would be incompatiable
with the duty of ‘eating the remnants’) \[and the other duties are
clearly laid down as to be observed only *till the ceremony of Return*
\]. So that, the expression in question can only indicate the avoiding
of Honey, Meat and Sexual Intercourse (which is among the duties of the
Religious Student, and is compatible with the life of the Householder).”

But there is not much in all this; since the term, ‘Religious Student,’
is generally used in the sense of ‘avoiding sexual intercourse.’—(128)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.79);—in *Aparārka* (p. 103),
which adds that on the ground of the terms ‘*Aṣṭami*’ and ‘*Caturdaśī*’
occurring along with ‘*Amāvasyā*’, it is understood that they stand for
the eighth and fourteenth days of the *Fortnight*,—not of the
‘season’;—and that the particle ‘*api*’ indicates that intercourse on
the dates mentioned is to be avoided, also when they happen to fall
outside the ‘season’;—and in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 724), which adds that
‘*Aṣṭamī*’ and ‘*Caturdaśī* mentioned as they are along with
‘*Amāvasyā*,’ must stand for the eighth and fourteenth days *of the
fortnight*, not those of the wife’s ‘period.’

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 346);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 498), which adds that the passage is to be construed as
‘*strīsaṅgatyāgena brahmacārī bhavet*’; ‘on the dates of the month
specified, one should behave like the Student by avoiding intercourse
with his wife’;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 286 and 368), as forbidding
sexual intercourse on ‘*parva*’ days, and adds that ‘*snātakaḥ*’ here
stands for the *House-holder*;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 683);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 38);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
155), which adds that the particle ‘*ca*’ is meant to include the
*Saṅkrānti* day,—and explains the term ‘*snātaka*’ to mean ‘one whose
wife has bathed for her season.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This prohibition does not apply to the daily bath; since there is no
possibility of its ever being done after the meals; specially, as in
another *Smṛti-text*, the order of sequence has been distinctly laid
down as—‘(1) Bath, (2) the Great Sacrifices and (3) the Eating of
Remnants.’ Nor can the prohibition apply to the bath necessitated by
touching of the Cāṇḍāla and such other circumstances; because such a
prohibition would be contrary to the general law that ‘one shall not
remain impure for a single moment.’ From all this it follows that the
prohibition applies to that purely voluntary bathing which one has
recourse to for the relieving of heat and perspiration, etc.

‘*Ill*’—suffering from some disease. For the sick person, all kinds of
bath have been forbidden, even when he may have become unclean;
specially in view of the direction that ‘one shall protect himself from
all things.’

*Question*—“How would such a man be purified?”

*Answer*— He shall sprinkle water over his body, or wipe off his body
with Mantras, or change his clothes, and so forth.

‘*Midnight*,’ ‘*Mahāniśā*;’—*i.e*., Four ‘*muhūrtas*,’ two on each side
of midnight.

Some people explain the term ‘*mahāniśā*’ as ‘*Long Night*,’ such as we
have during the winter.

But this explanation (by which bathing during winter-nights would be
forbidden) would be contrary to the Injunction that lays down early
morning bath during the (winter) months of *Māgha*, and *Phālguna*; and
as such, it must be regarded as a wrong explanation. Nor is there any
ground for restricting the prohibition to *winter nights* only;
specially as the text does not contain a second ‘*niśā*’ (which alone
could afford the sense, ‘during the night of those months when nights
are long.’)

‘*Along with his garments*.’—This implies that the prohibition applies
to the case where, during the cold weather, a man is wearing several
pieces of clothes; especially bathing with one piece of cloth on is what
has been already enjoined by such directions as ‘he shall not bathe
naked’ (4.45);—When he is wearing *two* pieces of cloth, there is
uncertainty, he may or may not bathe;—but when he has several pieces on,
he shall not bathe.

‘*Water-reservoir*’—containing water;—‘*unknown*’—*i.e*., with regard to
which it is not known whether it is deep or not deep, or whether there
are, or are not, allegators in it.

‘*Ajasram*’—ever, always.—(129)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 135);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 159), which adds that what the first quarter forbids is
‘that bathing which one may do voluntarily, without any occasion, after
having taken his food’; it cannot refer to the obligatory daily bathing,
which must precede the breakfast; nor can it refer to the bathing that
is rendered necessary by the touching of a *cāṇḍāla* or other unclean
things, since it has been laid down that ‘one should not remain unclean
for a single moment.’ \[This it quotes as from Medhātithi\];—then even
after food, if such occasions should arise as an eclipse and the like,
one must bathe;—‘*āturaḥ*’ is explained as ‘one suffering from a disease
likely to be aggravated by bathing’,—and ‘*mahāniśā*’ as the second and
third quarters of the night;—the phrase ‘*na vāsobhiḥ*’ is explained as
indicating that on those occasions on which it is laid down that one
should bathe ‘along with his clothes,’ there would be nothing wrong in
doing so even when one is wearing several pieces of cloth.—‘*Ajasram*’
means ‘constantly.’—The bathing that is forbidden here is such as is
done by men either through sheer foolishness or through false notions of
purity,—and not that which becomes necessary on one’s arrival at a
sacred place.—‘*Avijñāte*’—means those ‘water-reservoirs’ in regard to
which it is not known whether they are deep or otherwise, free or not
from alligators and other animals, dug by respectable men or otherwise,
and duly consecrated or not.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 246);—in *Kālaviveka* (p. 340);—in
*Smṛtitattva, on* p. 38, where it is added that what is forbidden is
*frequent bathing*, as is clear from the adverb ‘*ajasram*’;—on p. 160,
where it adds that the prohibition of bathing at night does not apply to
bathing at an eclipse;—and on p. 365, where it is explained as referring
to that bathing which is done for the mere love of doing it,—and not to
that which is rendered necessary on certain occasions and circumstances,
nor to the daily bathing;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 708), which has the
following notes:—‘*Bhuktvā*,’ this prohibition does not refer to the
ordinary daily bath; nor to the bath necessitated by the touch of the
Cāṇḍāla, as that impurity must be got rid of immediately; it must refer
to the voluntary bath for mere pleasure;—as regards the ‘*ātura*,’
sick-person, the full bath is forbidden for him at all
times;—‘*ajasram*’ means ‘constantly’;—also in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
857);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 306), which has the same note, and says
such is the opinion of Medhātithi; it is only the ordinary bath (not
religious) that is forbidden at ‘dead of night’ and ‘constantly,’ so
also ‘*avijñāte*.’ &c.—which means ‘that water-reservoir in regard to
which it is not known how deep it is or whether or not it is
objectionable in any way’;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 273).

‘*Gods*’ here stands for *Images*; as these alone can cast shadows.

‘*Superior*’—*i.e*., his father.

‘*Preceptor*’—one who has performed for him the Initiatory Ceremony.

These two have been mentioned separately, with a view to show that this
additional respect is to be shown to the two persons concerned, not
simply because they are to be treated as ‘superiors,’ \[but because they
are, by their distinctive character, entitled to this additional form of
respect\].

Hence, what is here prescribed does not apply to the maternal uncle and
such other persons.

Some people assert that “such a view would be contrary to usage; hence
the separate mention of the two (‘superior’ and ‘preceptor’) has to be
explained as anologous to such expressions as ‘(*gobalīvarda*,’ ‘bovine
bull’ (where the tautology indicates some sort of distinctive
superiority).

‘*Tawny*’ is the reddish brown colour; it stands here for a substance
possessed of that colour; in the present context it stands for either
the *tawny cow* or the *Soma-creeper*; the term ‘*babhru*’ (‘tawny’)
being found in the Veda to be applied to both these things.

‘*intentionally*.’—This means that if it is done unintentionally, there
is no wrong done.—(130)

(Medhātithi);—‘the tawny’ (Kullūka);—‘tawny cow’ (Nandana);—‘a brown
creature’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 193), which explains ‘*babhru*’
as ‘a tawny animal, such as the cow and the like’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.152), which explains ‘*babhru*’ as ‘the cow or any other animal which
is of the colour of the mongoose’ or ‘the Soma and other such
creepers’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 120), which explains ‘*babhru*’
simply as ‘*kapila*’, ‘tawny’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 523);—in

simply as ‘*kapilaḥ*’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 88a);—and in

‘*Used water*’—water that has been used for bathing, etc.

‘*Spittings*.’—Even apart from the mucus, in which form spittings are
generally thrown out; such things, for instance, as the betel-leaf and
other things, of which the juices have been eaten up and the tasteless
substance is thrown out.

‘*Standing upon*’ means *stepping upon*.

To his enemy, he shall not send presents,—he shall not sit or stand in
the same place with him,—he shall not go home in his company,—he shall
not carry on conversation with him, and so forth.

‘*Unrighteous person*,’—a sinner, *i.e*., one who maintains himself by
bad livelihood.

‘*Thief*’—one who steals things. It is this separate mention of the
‘thief’ which implies that *all*‘ unrighteous’ persons are not meant to
be avoided, but only those mentioned above (those living by evil ways of
living).

‘*The lady of another person*.’—The use of the term ‘*lady*’ (‘*yoṣit*’)
and not ‘wife’ (‘*pat??*’) is meant to show that one shall avoid, not
only the married wife, but also the ‘kept’ woman; because paying
attention to both equally leads to enmity; and the present prohibition
is based upon visible (ordinary worldly) considerations. In the next
verse, we have the term ‘*wife*,’ (‘*dārā*’), which is meant to indicate
the excessive spiritual wrong involved. It would not be right to assert
that—“the general term ‘lady’ in the present verse is restricted in its
extension by the term ‘wife’ in the next verse, which is supplementary
to this one.” Because, as a matter of fact, the next is *not*
supplementary to the present verse, which stands distinct by
itself.—(133)

‘*Failure*’—non-acquisition of wealth, by agriculture and such other
means.

‘*He shall not despise himself*,’—regarding himself as ‘unfortunate,’ as
a ‘sinner, ‘I have not obtained wealth at this time, at what time shall
I obtain it?’—He shall not ponder, in this fashion, over his failure.

‘*Until death, he should seek fortune*;’—*i.e*., to his very last
breath, he should not renounce the desire for acquiring wealth.

‘*He should not reyard* *her* *as unattainable*.’—Having formed the
determination, ‘My attempt shall surely succeed,’ he shall not mind the
evil aspects of planets or other disheartening circumstances, and shall
proceed to take steps to earn wealth. In this connection, there is a
saying—‘It is only persons devoid of manly courage that seek to examine
the aspect of planets; there is nothing unattainable for such persons as
are endowed with courage and energy.’

What is meant by this is as follows:—He who broods in the following
manner—‘I am in a sorry plight, I can obtain wealth, with difficulty, I
am not entitled to the setting up of Fire and other rites, and therefore
I am freed from the necessity of undergoing the trouble of performing
the Agnihotra and other rites’—does not think rightly; consequently, one

In regard to what a man may be called upon to speak, he is restricted to
telling the truth. The ‘*true*’ is that which is in strict accordance
with what is seen and heard.

‘*He shall say what is agreeable*.’— This is a second injunction. It is
only right to describe the nobility and other good qualities of a
person, even without any purpose. Then again, it would be right to speak
to a person of the birth of his son—‘O Brāhmaṇa, a son has been born to
you’—if it were true; even though the speeker may not have any motive of
his own in conveying the information; if it is not known to him already.

What is ‘true’ may be ‘agreeable’ as well as ‘disagreeable.’ An example
of the ‘agreeable truth’ has been already shown, in the form of the
assertion, ‘O Brāhmaṇa, a son has been born to you.’ An example of the
‘disagreeable truth’ we have in the form of the assertion, ‘Your maiden
daughter is with child’. If this he *untrue*, it should not be spoken
of, of course; but even if it be true, the fact of a virgin being with
child is something that should not be spoken of. In such cases, if the
man can help it, he should remain silent.

People might be led to think that, even when the girl is pregnant, it
would be right to say, ‘she is not pregnant,’ as such an assertion would
he ‘agreeable;’—with a view to this, the Author has added—‘*He shall not
say what is agreeable, but untrue*;’ so that for the man who is the
first to notice the signs of pregnancy in the girl, it would not do to
remain silent.

‘*This is the eternal law*’— The Veda is eternal, hence the law laid
down in the Veda is also eternal.—(138)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 163) to the effect that only

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first ‘*bhadra*’ (well) they have explained as with the negative
particle understood; the sense being—‘what is not well, he shall call
*well*.’

The particle ‘*iti*’ (after ‘*bhadran*’) is meant to be indicative; the
meaning being that “one shall make use of such agreeable words as
‘*Kalyāṇam*’ (welfare), ‘*maṅyalam*’ (auspicious), ‘*siddhan*’
(accomplished), ‘*śreyaḥ*’ (good), and so forth.

If we regard the first term ‘*bhadran*’ also as indicative of like
words, the meaning would be—‘If a man is blind, he should be spoken of
as *with eyes*; if he is illiterate, he should be spoken as *learned*’
and so forth.

Or, in all these cases, ‘*he shall simply say “well*.”’

‘*Needless enmity*.’—When there is no monetary or other interest
involved, he shall not make use of words in a mere bravado.

Similarly, he shall not create dispute in the king’s court. The epithet
‘*needless*’ applies to this also.

‘*With any one*’—*i.e*., even with a weaker party.—(139)

‘*Unclean*;’—*i.e*., not washed after having eaten; or, after having
evacuated the bladder or the bowels. The term ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ here stands
simply for ‘*impure*;’ and it is in this sense that the ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’
person is forbidden to touch the cow, etc. The expiatory rite in
connection with this forbidden touching is going to be prescribed in the
next verse, where the term ‘*ashuchi*,’ ‘impure,’ is used.

No significance attaches to the term ‘*hand*’, as touching with any
other part of the body also is not desirable. The prohibition, however,
does not apply to the case where one interposes a piece of cloth.

‘*He shall not look at the luminaries in the sky*.’—‘*Being in* *good*
*health’—i.e*., under normal conditions.—The addition of the pharse
(phrase?), ‘*in the sky*,’ indicates that the prohibition does not apply
to looking at the ‘luminary *on the earth*’—*i.e*., the fire.—(142)

described.

the shoulders, the touching whereof has been described as
purificatory;—and adds that the ‘touching’ here laid down is for the
purposes of purification.

It is also quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.155) as laying down the
purificatory act to be done after water-sipping;—and in

‘*Auspiciousness*’ consists in the accomplishment of such desirable
things as long life, wealth, and so forth;—the ‘*custom*’ is conducive
to this—such as the wearing of the *gorocanā* -mark on the forehead, the
touching of good fruit, and s o forth;—on such custom he shall be
‘*intent*’; *i.e*., he shall always follow such customs.

“The authority of *customs* has already been asserted before.”

True. But what is asserted here is custom pertaining to non-physical
ends. If those acts were done with a view to visible results, then it
would so happen that the acts would sometimes fail to bring about the
desired result, and this would lead the man to neglect them. It is for
this purpose that the thing is reiterated here. Just as in connection
with the time of starting on a journey, we shall have the reiteration of
such acts as the saluting of cows and other similar things, looking at
white garments, the singing of *kapiñjala-* birds to the right, the
crowing of the crow to the right on a fruit-laden tree. All these acts
shall be done for the sake of one’s welfare; and acts contrary to these
shall be avoided.

‘*With senses subjugated*’—without hankering for the objects of sense.
Though this has been often repeated, us being something desirable for
man, yet it is mentioned here with a view to save the man from falling
into sin.

Since oblation may be offered elsewhere also, the text has specially
mentioned the ‘fire.’

‘*Untired*.’—This only reiterates what has been said before.—(145)

reach the highest conditions. Those who, deviating from their own
Dharma, betake themselves to that of others, them the king shall punish,
and thereby rejoice in heaven. he who is linn in his own Dharma, even if
he he a Śūdra, obtains heaven; the Dharma of others should be always
shunned, like the beautiful wife of another man.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.2.27).—‘For all castes, there is high and
immeasurable happiness in the performance of their own Dharma. On
re-birth, by virtue of the residue of his *Karma*, he acquires his
caste, body, complexion, strength, memory, intelligence, riches and
meritorious behaviour.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.1).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who bathes daily, constantly wears
the sacred thread, reads the Veda daily, avoids the Śūdra’s food,
approaches his wife only during

the period and offers oblations according to law, never falls off from
the Brāhmic region.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.205).—‘Even the Householder becomes liberated, if he
has acquired property rightfully, has been devoted to truth and fond of
guests, has performed Śrāddhas and has always spoken the truth.’

Do. (3. 220).—‘By omitting what has been enjoined, by doing what has
been forbidden, and by omitting to control the sense-organs, the man
falls.’

‘*Calamity*’—supernatural troubles arising from natural portents,—such
as sickness, loss of wealth, separation from loved ones, and so forth.
All this is precluded from people who observe the auspicious customs.

This indicates the obligatory character of the acts, even though they
are done with a view to a definite end. No one ever actually seeks for
the cessation of supernatural troubles; hence, the term ‘*ever*’ is
purely reiterative; the meaning being that, even though there may be
some persons who may not seek it, yet the rule is entirely obligatory.
So that, by doing the act, the man fulfils two ends—he fulfils an
obligatory duty and also avoids calamity.—(146)

It has been said above that he should recite and offer oblations; and
now he states the means of doing the *reciting*.—‘*He shall recite the
Veda*’ The rest of the verse is purely commendatory.

‘*Whenever he finds time*’—the *Avyayībhāva* compound ‘*yathākālam*’
signifying *repetition*. The meaning is that ‘whenever the man happens
to be free from, all. worldly activity, he should recite the Veda.’ The
other duties—such as the performance of the *Agnihotra* and the
like—have their fixed time; while for *recitation*, *purity* is the only
condition.

This is the ‘*primary duty*;’ all else is ‘*secondary
duty*;’—‘*upadharma*’ means ‘nearly as good as duty.’ This compound,
therefore, is *Tatpuruṣa*, and not *Avyayībhāva*,—according to Pāṇini
2.1.55.

This deprecation of other duties is meant to be a praise of Vedic
recitation, and it is not meant to be a prohibition of those.—(147)

“Every man undertakes an action only when he desires to accomplish
thereby something desirable. The recollection of former births, however,
cannot be entirely pleasant. Why then is this described as the result
following Vedic Study and the other three acts?”

In view of this question, the Author says—‘*Recollecting his former
births, he continues to study the Veda*,’ *i.e*., he acquires faith in
it; the idea being—‘Vedic study is such a good thing that it has enabled
me to remember my other births.’ Hence, recollecting his other births,
he again betakes himself to that study; and from this continuous Vedic
study extending over several lives, ‘*he obtains*’—acquires—‘*bliss*’—in
the form of the ‘attainment of Brahman’:—‘*absolute*’—*i.e*., without
the chance of returning. The term ‘*endless*’ indicates a particular
kind of bliss,—the self-sufficient complete satisfaction of the Soul;
and the eternal character of this bliss is what is expressed by the term
‘*ajasram*,’ ‘*absolute*;’ the meaning being that ‘such and such a bliss
is attained, and it never perishes.’ Though the two terms (‘absolute’
and endless’) are synonymous, yet they are not entirely tautological.
Just as, in the case of the expression, ‘*vṛttakam vahataḥ purīṣam*,’ or
‘*vṛttakam udakam purīṣam*,’—where one (the term ‘*vṛttakam*’) is the
conventional and the other (‘*purīṣam*’) the literal or etymological
name of the thing; ‘*purīṣam*’ denotes, literally, *that which fills*,
so that this latter stands for the *soli* *d*, and the former for the
*liquid*, ordure.—(149)

The exact forms of the afore-mentioned oblations are now described.

‘*Oblations to Savitṛ*.’—Those that are offered to Savitṛ as the deity.

‘*Special days*;’—*i.e*., on the Moonless and the Full Moon Days—the
said oblations are to be offered.

‘*Pacificatory oblations*—the oblations that are offered for the purpose
of averting evil.

At all these oblations, Clarified Butter is to be the substance offered;
for, in regard to all oblations, it has been declared that, where no
substance is specified, Clarified Butter is to be used, by such passages
as—‘what is called Clarified Butter is used at all sacrifices.’

The Locative ending in ‘*parvasu*’ (‘on special days’) has the force of
the Accusative; as the *receptacle* (which is what is denoted by the
Locative) of the oblation is Fire, which is never the *object*; the
*objects* offered being mentioned as—‘fried grain,’ ‘butter,’ ‘meat,’
‘mixed Hour,’ ‘curd,’ ‘milk’ and ‘grains.’

These oblations are mentioned here for the first time, and the exact
procedure of these has been described before, as learnt from usage.

‘*Aṣṭakā*.’—The three eighth days of the three dark fort nights
following after the Full Moon Day of the month of ‘*Āgrahāyaṇa*;’
according to some, it stands for the four eighth days of the four dark
fortnights during the *Hemanta* and *Śiśira seasons*.—On these days,
‘*he shall worship the pitṛs*’—‘by means of *śraḍdha*; the J;erm
‘*pitṛ*,’ standing for one’s dead ancestors—‘*Anvaṣṭakā*’ is the name of
the ninth days following the aforesaid ‘*aṣṭakās*.’—(150).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Among Vedic passages describing the limbs of animals, the excretory
organ is called ‘*Mitra*;’ taking the term ‘*Mitra*’ in the same sense
here also, its derivative ‘*maitra*’ is taken to mean the ‘clearing of
the excretory organ’.

‘*Toilette*’—dressing of the hair, painting, and so forth. Or, the two
terms ‘*maitram*’ and ‘*prasādhanam*’ may be construed together, as noun
and adjective, which would mean that, even without passing any faeces,
one should wash his excretory organ, just as the washing of the mouth
after sleep has been prescribed as necessary, in view of the fact that,
during sleep, saliva is sure to flow out; similarly, even in

the absence of any direct reason, it is necessary to wash the mouth as
also the lower limbs of the body.

Others explain that ‘*maitra*’ means ‘the act of a *maitra*, friend the
*friendly act*; and what the text means is that ‘friendly acts should be
done before all other, even the most entimately necessary, acts but the
precedence to be given is only over the acts that one may do for his own
benefit, and *not* those that have to be done for the sake of
cleanliness. In this case, the term ‘*forenoon*’ would mean only
*precedence over the other acts*, and not the *exclusion of the
afternoon*.

Or again, ‘Mitra’ may stand for the sun; and ‘*Maitra*’ in that case
would mean ‘the worshipping of the Sun.’—(152)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika), on page 31, where it
is noted that all this to be done in the forenoon is meant for persons
not otherwise engaged;—that the term ‘*Pūrvāhṇa*’, ‘forenoon’, really
stands for ‘early morning’, since ‘the evacuation of the bowels’, and
‘cleaning of the teeth’ have been laid down as to be done in the early
mornings—Hence the term ‘forenoon’ should be taken to stand for such
parts of the forenoon as have been specifically prescribed for each of
the acts; thus it follows that the ‘evacuation of the bowels’, ‘cleaning
of the teeth’ and ‘morning-bath’ cannot be done-after sun-rise in regard
to the ‘worshipping of gods’, the term ‘forenoon’ should be understood
as standing for the first eighth part of the day.—The verse is quoted
again on page 148;—and in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 290).

*Dakṣa* (2.4-6).—‘What is to be done during the first part of the day is
now prescribed,—as also that to be done during the second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the day, generally: at
dawn, one shall perform the evacuations, and then bath, preceded by the
cleansing of the teeth.’

*Dakṣa* (30.31.33).—‘After that he shall perform his duty towards the
gods, and then the seeing of the teacher and the auspicious things; the
forenoon is the time prescribed for the duty to the gods; the duties to
the gods should be performed during the forenoon; and those to the men,
during midday; those to the pitṛs, in the afternoon...... If what has
been laid down as to be done in the forenoon is done in the evening, it
becomes absolutely futile.’

*Kālaviveka* (p. 367).—‘Duties to the gods should be performed during
the forenoon, those to the Pitṛs, in the afternoon; but the unitary
Śrāddha should be performed at midday, and the auspicious Śrāddha in the
morning.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 61.2).—‘Fully equipped with auspicious rites,
duly purified and with due care, he shall perform the duty towards gods
in the forenoon, and that towards Pitṛs in the afternoon.’

Do. (Do., 161.25).—(Same as Manu.)
