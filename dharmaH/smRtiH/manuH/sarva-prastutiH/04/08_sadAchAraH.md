‘*Eclipsed*’—Hidden by eclipse.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 180);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.135),
in the sense that looking at the Sun is forbidden only at stated times,
not always, as seems to be implied by Yājñavalkya’s words;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 494), which explains ‘*uparaktam*’ (*v.
l*. ‘*upasṛṣṭam*’) as ‘eclipsed’;—again on p. 578, as mentioning things
that should not be looked at;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 162), which adds that
the prohibition of looking at the eclipsed sun is not applicable to that
seeing of the eclipse which has been clearly enjoined as conducive to
great merit;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 476);—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi*
(p. 346);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 388) as prohibiting the house-holder
seeing the eclipsed sun;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (p. 124), which explains ‘*upasṛṣṭam*’ as ‘eclipsed’;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 292);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 320);—in
*Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 94), which says that ‘*īkṣaṇa*’ cannot be taken
as standing for mere *knowing* (as some people have held), and that it
does not prohibit the first *seeing* of the eclipse, which is necessary
to entitle the man to bathe; what is forbidden is only the unnecessary
*repeated* seeing of the eclipse;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 218).

‘*Vatsatantrī*’ is the rope to which the calf is tethered; or, it may
mean ‘a line of calves.’ This ‘*he shall* *not* *step over*’— not cross
over. Says Gautama (9.52)—‘One shall not pass over the *vatsatantrī*.’

‘*Figure*’—shape of the body.

‘*Own*’— The addition of this implies that looking at the figure of
other persons is not forbidden.

‘*Such is the established rule*,’—ordained in the scriptures—(38).

This rule applies to cases where, when a man has started to go, the said
things happen to come in his way. He should go in such a manner
that-they remain to his right. Another *Smṛti* has laid down, in
connection with depatures, that—‘he should walk round rightwards.’

‘*Deity*’—as painted on scrolls, for purposes of worshipping. Gautama
has declared that—‘One shall pass round the temples of gods leaving them
on his right;’ and, on the strength of popular opinion, the term
‘*deity*’ of the text is to be taken as standing for the temples
containing images of the Four-armed *Viṣṇu*, the Sun and other gods;—and
the same should be done with sacrificial houses also, as the author is
going to declare later on.

‘*Madhu*’—should be taken here as standing for *Honey*, on the strength
of its being mentioned along with ‘clarified batter;’ also because it is
mentioned in the middle of a number of auspicious things.

‘*Well-known* *trees*’— Large trees, well known for their great utility
and size, or, for the large produce of flower and fruits; such trees,
for instance, as the *Udumbara*, and the like. ‘The Udumbara is vigour
itself,’ says a Vedic description.

Some people have explained ‘*well known*’ as ‘of superior quality.’ But
these people, have no support for this, except certain popular notions;
and they should be ignored.—(39)

*Gautama* (9.66).—‘A praiseworthy object, an auspicious object, a
temple, a cross-way and such objects,—he shall go round in such a manner
as to leave them on his right.’

*Viṣṇu* (63.26-30).—‘He shall go round the cross-ways in such a manner
as to leave them to his right; also a place where deities are being
worshipped; also well-known trees; also the fire, the Brāhmaṇa, the
courtesan, full water-jar, the mirror, the umbrella, the flag, the
banner, the *Bel-* tree and river-whirlpools; also the fan, the
*cāmara*, the horse, the elephant, the cow, curd, milk, honey and fried
grains.’

‘*Mad*’—even though suffering from the darts of passion.

‘*Courses*’—stands for the blood that appears every month in the woman.
When this is visible, he shall not approach her. Nor shall he sleep on

It may be argued that—‘the prohibition put forward is already implied in
the aforesaid prohibtion of touching a woman in her courses.’

Under 5.130, it is said that ‘the mouth of women is always pure,’ and
again one is advised to avoid ‘the leavings of women and Śūdras.’ Both
of these are true within their own limited sphere. When the mouth is
said to be ‘ever pure,’ it refers to the time of sexual intercourse, in
view of what has been declared in another *Smṛti* regarding ‘the purity
of the woman during sexual intercourse.’ From this it follows that the
prohibition applies to such a woman with whom one can never have such
intercourse; *e.g*., the mother, the sister, and the like. Specially
because what is prohibited here is not simply *affectionate treatment*,
but the entertaining of thoughts of love and longing preceded by the
erotic sentiment. Hence it follows that the ‘purity’ pertains to woman
related to such intercourse, and the prohibition to those not so
related.

The above considerations would give rise to the notion that one may eat
with one’s wife, who serves the purposes of sexual intercourse; hence
with a view to preclude such an idea, the text proceeds to declare—‘*he
shall not eat with his wife*.’

“As a matter of fact, what has been said regarding the ‘purity’ of the
woman’s mouth, refers to a particular form of advances that the man in
love generally makes, so that the purity can refer only to the act of
*kissing*; and there is no possibility of its making any one inclined to
eat with his wife.”

But the reiteration contained in the present verse is meant to show the
form of the *observance*; which means that one should make a life-long
vow that ‘he shall never eat with his wife.’

The ‘eating together’ that is mentioned here as the object of
prohibition is—(*a*) eating out of the same dish, (*b*) eating at the
same time and (*c*) eating at the same place. So that there can. be no
room for the idea that the pohibition applies to ‘leavings.’ That the
meaning of ‘eating *together*’ is as just mentioned we gather from other
Smṛti texts and from usage; as for ‘leavings,’ this term can only mean
what has been left.’ Thus, then, when it is said that—‘his friends and
others he shall feed *with his wife*’ (3.113),—it is clear that what is
meant is, *not* that they shall eat out *of the same dish* with the
wife, but that they shall eat at the same time and place with her.
\[Hence, it must be these latter that are forbidden by the present
verse\].

Others have explained ‘leavings’ as something different—as what has been
left after one has eaten. So that it would not be a case of ‘eating the
leavings’ when one eats in the same dish with one’s wife.

According to this explanation, what would be the object of the
prohibition would be *the eating with Śrūdas* (*Śūdras*?) only; and this
would involve the abandoning of universally accepted notions, under
which mere touch (of the Śūdra) is regarded as constituting ‘*ucciṣṭa*,’
‘leaving;’ and this touch is present also when two persons are ‘eating
together.’

Some people hold that what is forbidden is eating at the same time and
place; that this is so, follows from the fact that the teaching herein
contained is with a view to a visible purpose; the prohibition therefore
being based upon the fact that men differ in their nature, some men are
not pleased with their wife eating large quantities, while there are
others who, on finding their wife eating little, think that she is
deceiving him by eating little in his presence.

Similar to the above are the other restrictions: ‘*he shall not look at
her while she is eating*;’ if he sees her while eating, when she may be
opening her mouth wide, she may look ugly and thus fail to please her
husband.

‘*Snoring*’—is the sound made by the nose filled with the wind passing
down from the head. Here also the disfiguring of the face is likely to
make the husband displeased.

‘*Yawning*’—the prolonged breathing out of air with the mouth, or the
spreading out of the body and limbs. This also is undesirable on the
said grounds.

‘*Sitting at her ease*’—with hair diśevelled, with the body thrown upon
the ground.—(43)

One who is applying collyrium to another’s eyes, looks beautiful (hence
there is no harm in looking at her).

‘*Uncovered*’— with her clothing removed. As a rule, men long for
locking at a woman only when she is veiled; while, when the woman is
undressed, all her limbs become visible, and, on scrutiny, nil these may
not turn out to be shapely; consequently, one should avoid looking at a
naked woman.

‘*Desiring brightness*.’—‘Brightness’ stands for brightness of
complexion, as also for energy.—(44)

Even though the man always wears his sacred thread (and hence, correctly
speaking, he is never with only one piece of cloth on), yet, since the
sacred thread is always on the body and it does not cover any part of
the body, and since the present injunction is apart from the section
dealing with Upanayana (where the wearing of the sacred thread is
prescribed),—he is regarded as ‘*having only one piece of cloth on
himself*.’ What the text means is that, at the time of eating, he shall
have on his body a second piece of cloth capable of covering his body.

‘*He shall not pass urine*.’—‘Urine’ here stands for excretions of all
kinds.

‘*Pathi*’—on the road.

‘*On the haunts of cows*’—the path by which cows pass, or the place
where they go to graze.—(45)

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 35).—‘Pools, tanks, streams, hills,
cowdung, ashes, ploughed fields,—these he shall avoid; as also chaff,

‘*Nor walking, nor standing*.’—By the prohibition of passing urine while
walking or standing, it is implied that one should pass urine *sitting*.
Nor very close to the river, nor in the river itself; that is to be

river.

a mountain elsewhere than on the ‘top’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika,

What is meant is that one shall not do the act facing the wind; and the
other things he shall not look at, while urinating, even by turning his
body towards them. Since *wind* is colourless, its *seeing* can only he
ascertained by seeing the flight of leaves, hits of earth and other
things waft

ed by the wind. This prohibition would be incongruous if it applied to
the entire *air-circle* (atmosphere); since wind is blowing
everywhere.—(48)

As a commendatory supplement to this we have the next verse.

“Since it has been laid down that one should pass urine, facing the
north,—and the sun rises in the east,—how can one ever face the sun, in
view of which possibility we have the present prohibition?”

The present verse is a commendatory supplement; just like the
assertion—‘not in the sky, nor in heaven, &c.’ Then again, during the
northern solstice, the sun moving towards the north, it would be
possible to face the sun. Or, the prohibition may be taken as meant for
the common people (who may not know the rule regarding urinating with
face towards the north).

Some people read ‘*pratisandhyam*.’ But this is not right; because
regarding the passing of urine we have the rule that ‘during the two
twilights it shall be done as during the day;’ and also because the
forcible checking of urine, etc., has been forbidden. For these reasons,
we should read ‘*prativātam*,’ facing the wind.’

This verse is supplementary to the foregoing one.

‘*Mehakaḥ*’—may be construed either as ending with the
Present-participial affix ‘*śatṛ*,’ or with the affix ‘*tas*’ (having
the sense of the Ablative); the meaning being—‘the man passing urine,’
or ‘by the passing of urine.’—(49)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse, which is 52 in Buhler, Burnell and Kullūka and other
commentators, is 49 according to Medhātithi, who remarks that ‘some
people do not read this verse in the present Discourse’. It is
interesting, in the light of this remark, to note that this verse is not
quoted in any of the important Nibandhas.

This verse is quoted in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 248), which explains
‘*saṃvītāṅgaḥ*’ as ‘with the sacred thread hanging by the neck.’

‘*Tiraskṛtya*’—‘placing between’—the stick, etc.; on that he shall pass
urine. Or, ‘*tiraskṛtya*’ may mean ‘having covered;’ in which case, the
meaning would be that ‘he should cover the ground with sticks and then
pass urine.’ In this latter case, the reading with the
lnsturmental-ending—‘*tṛṇādinā*—would be clearer; the construction
being—‘having covered with sticks or with clods, or with leaves, or with
grass.’

‘*Pass it*’—i.e., pass urine and evacuate his bowels.

‘*Restraining his speech*, *clean*’—*i.e*., with mouth not unwashed (not
having anything in his mouth).

‘*Body wrapped*’—covered with cloth.

‘*Covered*’—the head tied up. The rule prescribed is—‘with the sacred
thread on his ear, etc.’—(50).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 34), which explains the meaning
to be that ‘one should cover the ground either with sticks, or with

‘*avaguṇṭhitaḥ*’, ‘with head covered’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.

‘*Shade*’—*i.e*., where the sun’s rays are shut out by walls or doors,

‘*Darkness*’—the obstruction of light by clouds or fogs or eclipses or

‘*With his face towards any direction he pleases*.’—He shall pass urine
with his face towards that direction which he finds convenient.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 42), which adds that this
applies to cases where, on account of mist or fog, the man is unable to
ascertain the directions.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 30), which adds the
following explanation:—During the night, in shade or in darkness,—and
during the day, in shade or in darkness caused by fog etc.,—and during
suffering to life caused by disease etc.,—and in danger due to thieves,
tiger and such other things;—Kullūka Bhaṭṭa reads ‘*prāṇabādhābhayeṣu*’
and explains it to man ‘when there is danger to life at the hands of
thieves etc.,’—‘one should do’—*i.e*., the ‘*mūtrocchārasamutsargam*’
(of the preceding verse). This verse supplies an exception to the law
regarding the facing of the North or the East etc.; so that this latter
law remains applicable to the day, when there is light, and also to the
night when there is moon-light. This view has the support of
*Kalpataru*. In view of the present verse specifying ‘day and night’,
the facing of the North remains compulsory at the two twilights. The
author of *Smṛticandrikā*, Mādhavācḥārya, Kullūka Bhaṭṭa and others have
held the view that the first half applies to cases where one has lost
all sense of direction; but this view has been rejected on the ground
that there is no authority for restricting the rule in this manner.

This is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 329);—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p.
152), which also adds that this refers to cases where the man has lost
all sense of direction;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 34).

‘*Junction-time*’—twilight.

‘*Saṃveśana*’—is *sleeping*.

Vedic Study also during twilight is going to be forbidden later on.
Another Smṛti has forbidden intercourse with women also, during
twilight, *e.g*.—‘At the time of twilight, one shall avoid four
acts—eating, sexual intercourse, sleeping and reading.’

‘*He shall not scratch the ground*.’—What is forbidden is the tearing of
the ground, and not the writing of letters, &c., with a writing-brush
and such things.

‘*He shall not remove his own garland*.’—Flowers stringed together are
called ‘garland;’ and when one has placed this upon his head, or on his
neck, he himself should not remove it,—either because it has faded or
because it is found to be too burdensome. What is meant is that he shall
have it removed by another person.

Some people assert that the whole of the verse pertains to the time of
twilight.—(55).

The term ‘*goṣṭha*,’ ‘*pen*’ signifies the dwelling-place; and it is a

would be superfluous\].

‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’—Significance is meant to be attached to the plural
number. \[What is prescribed is to be done only when there are many

When a heifer—either his own or some-body’s—is drinking water or milk,
he shall not prevent her; nor shall he tell of it to another person.

This rule refers to the time before milking. During milking, it has been
enjoined that the flow of milk is to be accelarated (by keeping the calf
near, and preventing it from sucking).

The feminine gender (in ‘*dhāyantim*’) implies that there is no harm in
preventing a male calf from sucking.

‘*Rainbow*’;—that which is called ‘*Śakradhanuṣ*’ and ‘*Vijñanacchāyā*’
in Kaśmir. ‘*In the sky*;’—this is a needless reiteration. But some

‘*Kingship*’ consists in ruling over a country; he shall not dwell in a
country which is under the sway of a *Śūdra*. The term ‘King’ here
stands for the seven constituents of Kingship,—*vis*., the minister! the
commander of the army, the judge, and so forth; and the present verse
forbids dwelling in a country where all of them belong to the *Śūdra*
caste.

*Objection*:—“It having been already said that he shall not dwell *in an
unrighteous village*, what is meant by ‘in a country surrounded by
unrighteous persons’ is already implied.”

There is no force in this objection. The former prohibition refers to
dwelling in a place *inhabited* by unrighteous persons; while what the
present verse means is that one shall not live in a place where
unrighteous persons, living elsewhere, may happen to congregate. That is
why the text has used the term ‘surrounded;’ the sense being that ‘one
shall not stay at a place which is crowded by such persons.’

Similarly with the country swarming with ‘*impostors*.’ Though these
also, being outside the pale of ‘Vedic religion,’ are included among the
‘unrighteous,’ yet they have been mentioned separately in consideration
of the fact that they pretend to be ‘*righteous*.’

‘*Frequented by*’—associated with—‘*men of the lowest castes*.’ Or,
‘*frequented*’ may mean ‘harassed;’ *e.g*., the Bāhlīka country, which
is frequently outrun by barbarians.—(61)

He shall not eat anything from which oil has been extracted; for
instance, the oil-cake, juices and meat. Later on (5.24-25), the Author
shall provide a counter-exception in the case of sacrificial remnants
and preparations of milk kept over-night; and the plural number (in the
term ‘*preparations* of milk’) is used in consideration of the large
number of much preparations as whey, coagulated milk and so forth;
though curd alone is the direct preparation of milk. But if curd alone
were meant to be included in the counter-exception, then the Author
would have mentioned that alone by name. So that curd can never be
regarded as ‘kept over-night.’ From this it follows that the prohibition
contained in the present verse does not apply to whey, coagulated milk
and such other preparations of milk.

‘*He shall not commit gluttony*’—Eat too much. The stomach is divided
into three parts: one part is to be filled with solid food, another with
water and other liquids, and the third is to be left empty for the
moving about of the juices; it is in this manner that one should eat;
and this means that he shall not commit gluttony.

‘*Very early*’—*i.e*., just at sun-rise, one should not eat. For weaker
people, the proper time for eating is after the expiry of three hours in
the morning, and for other persons it is midday.

‘*Not very late in the evening*’—*i.e*., one shall not eat at sunset;
‘*nor in the evening, if the has eaten in the morning*’— to his fill.
This means that at both times one should eat while some hunger is still
left. This is what has been thus asserted—‘Morning and evening are the
two times for eating, ordained by the gods. But if one has eaten to his
fill in the morning, then he shall not eat in the evening.’

Or, the text may be explained in the following manner:—‘He shall not eat
to his fill both in the morning and in the evening.’ It is in view of
this that Yājñavalkya (Acāra, 114) has advised light food in the
evening.—(62)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 476), which explains
‘*uddhṛtasneham*’ as refering to ‘*piṇyāka*’ (residue of seeds ground
for oil) and things of that kind; and ‘*atiprage*’, as ‘before the sun
long risen’;—the third quarter is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3. 290);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 30), as precluding the time of sunset and sunrise, and
explains

‘*Sauhitya*’ as ‘over-satisfaction ‘satiation’;—and in *Saṃskāramyūkha*
(p. 71), which remarks that by this the eating of ‘*takra*’ becomes
wrong; as there is nothing to justify an exception in favour of *takra*;
it explains ‘*Sauhitya*’ as ‘over-eating’.

‘*Dancing*’—Throwing about of the limbs in a particular manner, as is
well known among people.

‘*Singing*’—is the producing of sound in the ‘*Ṣadja*’ and other notes
of music. What is forbidden here is ordinary *temporal*, not *Vedic*,
singing; the latter being actually enjoined.

‘*Musical instruments*’—such as, the lute, the flute, the drum, and so
forth. What is forbidden is the man himself playing upon these; and not
making other people play upon them; as there is nothing to justify the
construing of the verb ‘*vādayet*’ as containing a two-fold causal affix
‘*ṇich*’—which alone could afford the meaning of ‘making to play.’

‘*Clapping*’—the sound made by the clapping of the hands, or by striking
the ground with the hand, and so forth.

‘*Grinding o* *f* *teeth*’—the indistinct sound made by the teeth is
what is known by the name of ‘*Kṣveḍanika*.’

If the man happens to be satisfied with anpther person, he shall not
create enmity with him. The prohibition does not apply to the case where
the man is harassed by the other person. The term ‘*virodhayet*’ is to
be explained as ‘*virodham*’ (this noun being found by the addition of
the nominal affix ‘*ghan* (?)’) ‘*kuryāt*’ (this being the connotation
of the ‘*ṇich*’ affix).—(64)

He should not wash his feet in a vessel of white brass.

In a broken vessel—even in one that may be broken in a single place;—the
use of one that is broken all over would be forbidden by its very
nature. In the case of cups, etc., made of leaves, however, since these
are never regarded as ‘broken vessels,’ there would be no harm in using
them, even though they may have holes.

‘*Bhāva*’ is feeling in mind; that vessel with which the mind does not
feel satisfied; or that which is defiled by name—such as ‘*patadgraha*,’
‘spittoon,’ and the like, in the case of these latter also, the mind

He should not wear these things, when they have been worn by his father
and others. Gautama says—‘In cases of disability, these may be used
after having been washed.’ (97 (9.7?))

‘*Karaka*’ is the water-pot; the using of the pot that is used by even
his father is contrary to usage. The pot is held to be a relative
substance, and hence can be used only by one to whom it belongs, and by
no other person.

‘*Ornament*’—bracelet of ivory, and so forth. By reason of this being
mentioned along with such cheap articles as the ‘water-pot,’ and the
like, it follows that the use of jewelry and pearl-ornaments is not
forbidden. This is the view of some people.—(66)

‘*Untrained*’—*i.e*., not trained; oxen, horses, mules and so forth,
which are yoked to chariots, etc. The use of ‘*ca*’ indicates that one
shall not ride upon untrained beasts,???en (even?) when they are not
yoked to chariots, etc.

The ‘injured horn’ pertains to the *ox* only; as that alone has horns,
and not horses and other animals.

‘*Bāladhi*’ is *tail*; those that have been disfigured by their tails;
whose tails have been cut off.

One should not travel on such animals. Another Smṛti text prohibits
merely getting upon the back of such animals.—(67)

Some people, in their audacity, do not make any attempt at training
animals. It is with a view to this that the Author adds this verse.

‘*Trained*’—well-broken.

‘*Fast*’—swift going.

‘*Equipped with signs*’—w ith such signs as auspicious hair-whorls, and
the like, and not with such unlucky marks as a bare forehead and the
like.

‘*Endowed with colour and form*’—‘*Colour*’ stands for the brightness of
the skin, etc., and ‘*form*’ for the shape of the limbs. The ‘goodness’
of these has to be ascertained with the help of treatises dealing with
the characterestics of animals, etc.

‘*Without striking much*’—not causing them pain, again and again ,—‘
*with the goad*;’ as being struck again and again with the hook, etc.,
they become perturbed and cause injury. (68)

For three ‘*muhūrtas*’ after rising, the sun is called the ‘young sun,’

‘*Smoke from the dead body*’—that which rises from a dead body being
burnt.

‘*Broken seat*’—*i.e*., that which is torn, or with holes, or injured.
All this should be avoided.

‘*He* *shall not cut his nails and hair*’—himself; when they have grown
too long, he should get them cut by the barber.

He should not tear his nails—even though they may have become very
long—with his teeth.

Others construe as follows:—‘He shall not cut bis nails and hair with
his teeth,—aud the nails he shall not cut even with his teeth.’

Young women often tear their nails, in the process of adorning,
them.—(69)

‘*Crushing*’ means *breaking into pieces*—of clods of earth; some people
hold that this refers also to such clods of earth as are mixed with lime
or other mortar. The ‘crushing’ of the earth-clod, consists either in
raising it and then throwing it down, or by pressing it with the hands.

The crushing that is forbidden here is one that is done aimlessly; nor
when it is done for the purpose of being used in cleaning the hands,
etc.,—the term ‘aimless’ of the next line being construed with this
also. Though, as such, the crushing would be included under the ‘aimless
act,’ yet it has been mentioned separately, with a view to the different
expiatory rite that has been prescribed in connection with it.

‘*Karaja*’ are nails.

‘*No aimless act*.’—*Objection*—“The *aimless act* has been already
prohibited under ‘purposeless exertion’ (63).”

Some people offer the following explanation:—‘*Exertion*’ denotes
*physical activity*; while what is forbidden here is *activity in
general* (in all its forms); which means that the building of airy
castles is to be avoided.

‘*Āyati*’ denotes *future time*. That act from which there follows, in
the future, some disagreeable, result; *e.g*., eating to indigestion,
spending one’s wealth without any consideration for the maintenance of
one’s family and dependants. All this he shall not do.—(70)

In support of the. above, we have the following commendatory
description—

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183), which explains ‘*āyati*’ as
‘*pariṇāma*’, ‘result’—‘*Karma*’ as *Saṅkalpa* ‘volition’,
‘determination’; and this is ‘fruitless,’ ‘*niṣphala*’, when it turns
out to be *false*, *i.e*., when the determination is not carried into
practice; as regards the crushing of clods etc., what is to be avoided
is the *habit* of doing it;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 72).

It is in view of the word ‘*loṣṭha*,’ ‘clod,’ being used here by itself
that the compound ‘*mṛlloṣṭha*’ of the preceding verse has been taken as
a *Tatpuruṣa* compound; for, if both ‘*mṛt*’ and ‘*loṣṭha*’ were meant
(and the compound were a *Dvandva* one) then, in the present verse also,
‘*mṛt*’ would have been mentioned in the same manner as ‘*loṣṭha*.’
Since clods are capable of being easily crushed, people are likely to do
it; hence it becomes necessary to forbid it. As for lime-mortar, its
crushing requires great effort, and hence people are not likely to do it
needlessly. As for the crushing of earth-clods, on the other hand, some
people are inclined, by their very nature, to do it; hence its
prohibition.

‘*Who cuts grass*’—as mentioned in the preceding verse.

‘*He who bites his nails*’—with his teeth.

‘*Sūcakaḥ*’—the informer, the back-biter; he who describes, behind his
back, the defects, real or unreal, of another person.

‘*Unclean*’—already explained.

‘*Quickly goes to perdition*.’—Other Vedic acts are uncertain regarding
the time at which their results appear; but the act here mentioned is
not so; its result appears ‘*quickly*’—in this very life—in the shape of
the loss of wealth, &c., which is what is meant here by ‘*perdition*.’

When, either in ordinary conversation or in literary discussions, one
talks with passion and lays a wager, and so forth, always trying to show
himself off,—this is what is called ‘*wrangling conversation*.’

‘*Garland outside*;’—*i.e*., if the garland happen to be above the
clothing, it should be hidden with a piece of cloth. Such is the custom
also.

Others have explained ‘outside’ to mean an open public place. The sense
of the text in that case would be that one should not wander about in
public places, as the road, &c., with a garland too obtrusively worn.

Or, ‘*bahirmālya*’ may mean that whose fragrance has gone out; *i.e*.,
whose odour is not felt. Says another Smṛti text—‘One should not wear an
odourless garland, except that made of gold.’

‘*Riding on the back of cows*’— What is forbidden is riding on the bare
back, without a saddle.—‘*Altogether*.’ When a saddle has been put on,
or the animal has been harnessed to the cart, &c., then it would not be
‘riding on the back;’ and hence these are not forbidden.—(72)

Even without stakes, in mere joke also, ‘*he shall never gamble with
dice*.’ The term ‘*never*’ is used for the purpose of precluding the use
of sticks, and such other implements also. Hence all kinds of gambling
are forbidden.

His shoes, made of leather, he shall not carry from one place to
another, ‘*himself*’—*i.e*., taking them in his own hand, or hanging
them on his stick. This prohibition applies to one’s own shoes, as is
clear from the term ‘himself;’ hence the carrying of the shoes belonging
to one’s Teacher or other superiors is not forbidden.

‘*On a bed*,’—seated on a conch, and such other things—‘*he shall not
eat*;’ nor placing the food-morsel on his hand; nor placing the food on
the sent, without an intervening dish. That this pertains to the food,
and not to the eater, is clear from the juxtaposition of what has gone
before.—(74)

Before the act of eating, one shall observe the rule that ‘one should

feet till he has finished eating and become fully satisfied.

‘*Shall not deep*’—*i.e*., he shall not lay down his body upon the bed;
‘*samveśana*,’ ‘sleeping,’ standing for the *laying down of the body on
the bed*.

The reason for this is next mentioned—‘*Long life*.’—It does not mean
that the injunction is meant only for one who desires long life (and for
none others); in fact, like the preceding ones, this also is obligatory;

‘*He shall not approach*.’—*He* shall not pass over, shall not go to.

‘*Which is not within the range of his vision*;’—because there is danger
of snakes and robbers, etc., lying hidden there. The ‘*Eye*’ includes
also the other sources of knowledge, such as the Scriptures, for

‘*Urine and excreta*’—‘Looking at’—these mean examining their colour,
etc. This extends over a long time; and hence should not be done. There
is no harm in seeing it once by the way.

“What is here said has already been declared above—(*a*) that ‘he shall
not live at a place surrounded by men...... nor in that which is haunted
by men of the lowest castes’ (4. 6).”

Not so, we reply. What has been forbidden there, is the *inhabiting* of
such places; while what is forbidden here is *associating*. What was
said there was that ‘one shall not set up as a householder in a village
inhabited by such people;’ while the present verse forbids associating
with them; this ‘associating’ consisting of the setting up of friendly
relations by accepting their gifts, living near their house, sitting
with them under the shade of the same tree, and so forth. Further, the
former text speaks of the village as being ‘surrounded,’ which implies
that the said people live there in large numbers; so that, what it means
is that ‘one should not live *even near* a village where the said people
live in large numbers.’ In the present verse, however, what is forbidden
is living near a village, where even a few of these people live. Herein
lies the difference between the two passages.

‘*Pulkasas*’ are Niṣādas, born of Śūdra mothers.

‘*Antyas*,’ *i.e*.—the *Medas* and other *Mleccchas*.

‘*Antyāvasāyins*’—is born from a Niṣāda mother and Cāṇḍāla father; as
will be described later on (10.39).

‘*Haughty*’—overbearing in vanity due to wealth and such other
causes.—(79)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

No advice shall be offered to a Śūdra regarding his welfare or
otherwise, regarding matters temporal or spiritual; that is to say, one
should not become an adviser to a Śūdra.

This prohibition pertains to being an adviser as a means of livelihood;
there would be nothing wrong in offering advice in a purely friendly
manner; in fact, there may be hereditary friendship between Brāhmaṇas
and Śūdras; and certainly through friendship advice for welfare is
always offered. Further, it has been declared (by Manu himself) that the
Brāhmaṇa should be *friendly* to all castes—‘the Brāhmaṇa is one who is
friendly to all.’

Some people offer the following explanation:—

“From what is said in other texts, it is better to take the present
verse to mean that advice shall not be offered *unasked*; as declared
above (in 2. 110),—‘He should not say anything to any one without being
asked.’”

This explanation, however, is not right. What has been said under 2,110,
is in connection with the reading of the

Veda; the sense being, ‘if a man is found to be committing a mistake in
accent, or syllable, or in some other detail, one should not tell him,
unless one is asked, that he had murdered the Text.’ Similarly, in
connection with the enumeration of persons who shall not be taught the
Veda, it has been said—‘One shall not speak unasked;’ and this also
means that, in the case of persons other than his own pupils, one should
not say anything, even if he finds them reciting the Veda wrongly,
either as regards accent or syllables.

‘*Nor the leavings*’—The term ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ denotes *impurity, specially
in relation to food*. One who has paid calls of nature, is also called
‘*ucchiṣṭa*,’ ‘impure,’ till he has washed; as we shall explain under
the text—‘One who is *impure, ucchiṣṭa*, shall not touch with his hand,
&c.’ (142). But, as a rule, the term is used in connection with *food*.
So that, while one is eating, the food that comes into contact with his
mouth, whether within the mouth or outside, becomes known as ‘impure.’
It is in this sense that under 5.141—where it is said—‘nor the hairs of
the moustache entering the mouth,’—everything, with the exception of the
hairs of the moustache, is said to become ‘impure.’ It is in this sense
also that the eater, the thing eaten and the dish containing the food,
all come to be called ‘impure’; ‘*ucchiṣṭa*.’

In some cases, the word is also used in the sense of ‘what has been left
unused,’ ‘remnant,’ ‘leaving;’; *e.g*., in the passage—‘The leavings of
the substance offered are to be given as the fee.’ Thus, it is on the
basis of usage that the term ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ is applied to the food that
has been served in the dish for a particular person,. and out of which a
little has been eaten by him; and the clean food that is simply placed
in the dish and not even touched by the eater,—this also is rejected, on
the strength of usage, as ‘impure,’ on the ground of its being in
contact with the dish which is in contact with that food out of which
the person has eaten (and which therefore has become a ‘leaving’). It is
in accordance with this that each passages as—(*a*) ‘the leavings of
food should be given’ (10.125), and (*b*) ‘leavings shall not be given,
etc.’—which contain an injunction and a prohibition, respectively—are
taken as pertaining to the same thing, and as applying to the ‘true’ and
the ‘untrue’ *Śūdra*, respectively, and also as referring to the
remnants of different kinds of materials offered (and hence not being
mutually contradictory). Or, the meaning (of the prohibition) may be
that what has been left in the pot, after the guests and others have
eaten, and which is as good as ‘stale’ and ‘leavings,’ should not be
given to the *Śūdra*. It is argued that, since the term is found to be
used (in 10.125) along with ‘torn clothes,’ this latter explanation is
the right one to be accepted. Further, since the root ‘*śiṣ*’ (from
which ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ has been derived) denotes ‘other than what has been
used,’ and the preposition (‘*ut*’) has to be construed in accordance
with that signification,—there need be nothing incongruous in construing
this passage also in the same sense as the passage ‘the leavings of the
substance offered are to be given as the fee.’ In this manner, there is
no incompatibility between these two *Smṛti-* texts (‘the leavings of
the food shall be given’ and ‘the leavings should not be given’); though
in most passages the term is restricted, by convention, to people who
stand in need of washing. As for the declaration that ‘the method of
purification is like that of the Vaiśya, etc.’ (5.139)—this refers to
the *Slave-Śūdra*; and the term ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ in this passage is
understood to mean ‘the leavings of food,’ as we shall show under this
passage.

‘*Nor what has been prepared as an offering to the Gods*’—The term
‘*haviṣ-kṛtam*’ means ‘*haviṣe kṛtam*,’ ‘prepared as an offering to the
Gods.’ The compound is an irregular one; the compounding of the
participle ‘*kṛṭa*’ or ‘*kalpita*,’ with the noun ending in the Dative,
having the sense of ‘for the purpose of,’ is not sanctioned.

According to the maxim of the ‘stick and the cake’—by which, when the
stick on which cakes are hanging is brought down by rats, we are led to
believe that the cakes have been eaten by them,—the prohibition
contained in the text pertains to every such thing as has the slightest
possibility of being intended for being offered. And thus it is that the
prohibition becomes applicable (*a*) to what has been set aside as being
meant for an’ offering, (*b*) to the remnant of the substance that has
been offered, and (*c*) to such offering-material as has not been left
after having been eaten. It is in view of this that the text has used
the term ‘*kṛta*,’ which is the most general term denoting *action of
any kind*; and the compound ‘*haviṣ-kṛta*’ means ‘what has been *kṛta*,’
*i.e*., determined upon—as to be offered.’ And in this way, the
offering-material that is left after the sacrificer has eaten it, does
not cease to be included under the term ‘*haviṣ-kṛta*,’ since that also
is what ‘had been determined upon as to be offered.’ And thus the
prohibition becomes applicable to the substance in all conditions (after
it has been once fixed upon as to be offered).

By others the term ‘*haviṣ-kṛtam*’ has been explained as ‘mixed with the
offering-material;’ and since what is mixed up with something else is
prohibited, the unmixed offering-material also becomes forbidden. For
instance, when it is intended to forbid what is related to the Brāhmaṇa,
the texts use the word ‘Brāhmaṇa’ only.

“But how can the prohibition of the thing mixed with something else
imply the prohibition of that thing by itself?”

If the thing by itself were prohibited, then it might have been argued
that the prohibition of the mixed thing is secondary. In a case,
however, where, even on being mixed up, the two things are percieved as
distinct,—or, when, even though the colour of the two things is not
visible, yet by means of taste and such other means they are percieved
as distinct,—the two things are treated as if they were there by
themselves.

For instance, when fried flour and other things are mixed with wine,
even though the colour of the wine is not visible, yet, since the taste
of the wine is distinctly felt, the eating of such flour entails the
expiratory rite prescribed in connection with the drinking of wine.

*Objection*—“But even so, when the wine is mixed up with the flour, it
loses its liquid form; so that it cannot be a case of *drinking* of the
wine.”

There is no force in this objection. ‘Drinking’ has been mentioned,
because that is how wine is generally taken; and what is forbidden is
the ‘*taking*’ of wine; as the present context is dealing with what
shall be eaten and what shall be not eaten; and ‘eating’ here means only
‘*taking*,’ of which *drinking*, *eating, chewing* and the rest are only
special forms. As for *smelling*, since it is felt even when the
substance is not near at hand, it does not necessarily lead to the
presence of the substance itself. For instance, even when camphor and
such things are at a distance, their odour is felt. If it be assumed
that the odour is felt because of the fine particles of the substance
(having been wafted into the nostrils),—then such wafting away of the
particles should bring out a gradual diminution of the size of the
substance (which is not found to take place). In a case where two things
become mixed up and form one composite substance, and there is nothing
to indicate a reference to either one of them singly,—either a sanction
or a prohibition cannot apply to either of them by itself. *E.g*., when
it is said ‘milk should be drunk,’ it applies to the milk and the water
both mixed together, and not to the *water* alone, or the *milk* alone;
as each of these would be a distinct substance (from ‘milk’); each of
these by itself would have a distinct colour and a distinct taste
indicating its presence; and hence each would be a distinct substance.

“If this be so, then, when one drinks wine mixed with water, it should
not entail the expiatory rite that has been prescribed for the *drinking
of wine*; as the mixture would be a distinct substance from the mixture
drunk.”

There is no force in this objection. Wine, like the bitter taste,
entirely suppresses the taste of everything eke; so that, since in the
case cited, the taste of wine will have been clearly felt, the said
expiatory rite becomes necessary. When there is much water and only a
little wine, the expiatory rite to be performed is that which has been
prescribed for ‘contact with wine,’ as we shall explain in detail under
Discourse 11.

From all this it follows that where the prohibition is of a certain
thing by itself, it might involve that of its mixture also; *e.g*., when
it is said that “*māṣa* -grains shall not be eaten,’ such grains also
become eschewed as have *māṣa* mixed with them. But the prohibition that
pertains to a mixture—on what grounds could it be applied to the unmixed
thing by itself? *E.g*., when it is said—‘bring water from the
confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā,’—the man thus directed does not
bring water either from the Gaṅgā alone, or from the Yamunā alone. If
usage be cited as the ground for such application,—theu such usage has
got to be shown. \[Thus, if the term ‘*haviṣkṛtan*’ of the text were
taken as ‘*havirmiśram*,’ then the prohibition could not apply to the
*Haviṣ* itself.\]

‘*He shall not expound the law to him*.’—“The very first words of this
text have forbidden the offering to a *Śūdra* of any advice on temporal
or spiritual matters; and the expounding of law also becomes forbidden
by the same words.”

True; but the prohibition has been repeated for the purpose of
additional information; in the shape of special expiatory rites—laid
down in connection with the expounding of the law to a Śūdra,—which we
shall explain under 11.198.

Others have taken this additional prohibition to mean that ‘he shall
not, in the craracter (character?) of an officiating priest, instruct
the *Śūdra* regarding the details of procedure pertaining to the
*Pārvaṇa Śrāddha*, the *Pākayajña* and such other rites.’

Some people urge the following objection here:—“If the expounding of law
to the *Śūdra* is forbidden, from whence is the *Śūdra* to acquire his
knowledge of the law? In the absence of such knowledge, he can perform
no rites; so that the whole scripture dealing with the rites to be
performed by the *Śūdra* would be pointless.”

This is not a right objection. It is just possible that the Brāhmaṇa,
through avarice, may transgress the prohibition and teach the *Śūdra*.
For instance, when the Brāhmaṇa accepts a gift from a *Śūdra*, he is
urged to it. not by the Injunction relating to the ‘giving away of all
one’s belongings’ (which has been prescribed for the *Śūdra*) in
consequence of having killed a Brāhmaṇa; in fact, the motive is supplied
by his avarice.

“Well, we have the direct declaration that ‘the Brāhmaṇa shall explain
the law to others also.’”

But that refers only to the possible means of livelihood (open to the
*Śūdra*). What the text says is—‘The Brāhmaṇa should know the means of
livelihood open to all, and should explain it to others also’ (10.2).

Advice and teachings have to be certainly given to the *Śūdra* who is
dependent upon oneself; for an ignorant person is sure to transgress
injunctions and prohibitions; and association with such transgressers
has been forbidden under 79 above.

Some people explain the text as follows:—

“The present text contains two injunctions forbidding the teaching of
the text of the treatises dealing with Dharma or Law, and the expounding
of its meaning: one forbids the teaching of the verbal text and the
other that of its meaning. But the expounding of Law, without reference
to text, is not forbidden by any.”

But for those who explain the text thus, the present Verse will be a
mere repetition of the prohibition of consultation on matters relating
to the scriptures.

The following might be urged here—“The term ‘law’ applies to Grammar and
all those treatises that help in obtaining the knowledge of Law; but
Grammar is not a ‘scriptural treatise,’ in the sense of expounding
super-senseous (spiritual) things; hence the teaching of Grammar would
not be included under the prohibition here put forward; and yet Grammar
is of use in the understanding of Law; specially as the grammarian can,
by a close analysis of the words, find out the meaning of the most
difficult sentence. So that, since the prohibition relating to the
‘consultation’ (quoted above) pertains to the ‘Law-scriptures’ proper,
it would not apply to Grammar; hence it is the teaching of Grammar that
has been separately forbidden by the present text.”

All this would be quite right; only if no one urged that one who is not
entitled to the primary thing (the Veda), can never be thought of as
taking up its subsidiaries (the subsidiary sciences of Grammar, &c.) In
the present instance, the Veda and this Smṛti texts constitute the
‘primary;’ and to the study of these the *Śūdra* is not entitled.

‘*Nor shall he indicate to him any vrata or penance*.’—The term
‘*vrata*,’ ‘penance,’ here stands for the *kṛcchras*; such being the
sense in which the term has been used in 11.102 and other texts. These
be shall not indicate to the *Śūdra* who is seeking to acquire
prosperity by their means; in connection with expiatory rites, they have
got to be indicated. As for the ‘*vratas*,’ ‘observances,’ prescribed
for the ‘accomplished student,’ there is no possibility of these
pertaining to the *Śūdra*; for the simple reason that he can never be an
‘accomplished student.’ Similarly, the imparting of the *Sāvitrī* to him
is impossible, because he can never carry on Vedic Study; Vedic Study is
not possible for him, because he has not been *initiated*; and
Initiation is not possible for him, because it has been laid down for
the *three castes* only.—(80).

“Discrepancies between this verse and others in the work (9.125) are
explained by the commentators, who say that the Śūdra mentioned in the
other rules is the family servant.”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 220), which explains ‘*vratam*’
as ‘*prāyascittam*’, ‘expiatory rite’;—and again on p. 1090, where it is
pointed out that the giving of advice regarding ‘expiation’, that is
forbidden here, refers to those cases where the Śūdra seeks advice
without the mediation of a Brāhmaṇa.

It is quoted also in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.262), which remarks that the
prohibition refers to those cases where the Śūdra does not seek advice
in a meek and suppliant attitude;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
71b);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 72), which says that what is
forbidden here is ‘*direct* teaching.’

‘*Joined together*’—joined to one another. This forbids the scratching
of the head with both hands at the same time.

*Hands*; this forbids the use of the two arms joined together.

‘*His own*’— not that of others; hence there would be nothing wrong in
having one’s head scratched with the two hands of another person.

Since the *head* has been specified, there would be nothing wrong in
scratching the back and other parts of the body.

‘*He shall not touch it*’—his own head, with his own hand,—or with any
other part of the body, as some people have explained. But this is not
right, as it is the *hands* that are being spoken of in the text.

‘*He shall not bathe without it*’—*i.e*., without the head. This rule
applies to all kinds of bathing—the daily obligatory one as well as the
occasional one.

“Why should this rule be observed in the case of ordinary bathing, done
by a person who has perspired (and only wishes to clean the
perspiration)?”

That it should be so follows from the fact that the present rule is
meant to be taken along with the rule laying down *bathing*.

For connecting this rule with the *bathing* that is directly
enjoined,—there may be some reason. But, so far as the *ordinary*
bathing is concerned, since there is no injuction regarding it, there
can be no ground for observing the present rule in connection with it.”

Well, as a matter of fact, the root^(‘)to bathe’ denotes the act of
washing with water, cow’s urine and such things—*the whole body* or the
rest of the body, *barring the head*. And, since people might leave off
the head, when bathing on having touched a *Cāṇḍāla*, or some such
unclean thing,—the text forbids this by the rule—‘he shall not bathe
without the head.’ Ordinary bathing, without washing the head, is of
course possible; in view of which we have such assertions as—‘having
*bathed his head*, etc., etc.,’—(82)

Some people hold that this refers to one’s own head, as well as to the

What is forbidden here is the hair-catching, etc., done in anger; for
there is ‘hair-catching’ also during sexual intercourse, and this is not
forbidden.

The compound ‘*śiraḥ-snāta*’ is to be expounded as^(‘)*śiraḥ snātam
anena*,’ he whose head has been bathed, the order of the term being in
accordance with the rule governing such compounds as, by appearance,
belong to the ‘*Rājadanta*’ group (Pāṇini 2.2.31).

It has been said above (4.33) that ‘he shall seek for wealth form
Kings,’ This word, “king,” denoting the *lord of men*, has been found to
be applied to the *Kṣatriya* as well as the *non-Kṣatriya*; *e.g*., in
such expressions as ‘the Kingdom of Brāhmaṇas,’ Hence, in connection
with a rule regarding the acceptance of gifts, when we find a
prohibition, we take the term as standing for the *lord of men*;
specially, as in the present verse, we have the phrase ‘*not born of the
Kṣatriya caste*,’ Since it is possible for one to accept, through
avarice, the gifts of the lords of men, belonging to all castes, the
text has specified it; the sense being—‘one shall not accept gifts from
such a lord of men as is not born of the *Kṣatriya* caste; nor even from
the *Kṣatriya* king, who does not behave according to the scriptures as
will be made clear by the prohibition coming later on.

‘*Sūnā*’ is *slaughter-house*; and he who lives by selling meat, after
having slaughtered the animal, is called a butcher,’ a ‘keeper of the
slaughter-house.’

Similarly, ‘*cakravān*’ is one who lives by oil-pressing; who is known
among men as ‘*khaṭika*.’

‘*Dhvaja*’ is wine-shop; and the ‘*dhvajavān*’ is he who lives by buying
and selling wine

‘*Veśa*’ is brothel; he who lives by this—be it a man or a woman.—(84)

confiscates the women, and so forth.

‘*In succession*’—*i.e*., he goes to another hell after having

‘*Hell*.’—This term signifies *extreme suffering*; and, since *extreme

**(verses 4.87-91)

*Viṣṇu* (43.1-22).—‘The Hells are as follows—

1.  Tāmisra,
2.  Andhatāmisra,
3.  Raurava,
4.  Mahāraurava,
5.  Kālasūtra,
6.  Mahāmaraka,

*Skandapurāṇa* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 199).—‘The man who has
been brought up on gifts from the king becomes a Brahmarākṣasa in the
water-less desert, and docs not obtain another birth. The man who,
having renounced his Brāhmaṇahood, and deluded by greed for riches and
for sensual objects, accepts gifts from the king, his fall into the
Raurava hell is certain. Even trees burnt by forest-fíres grow again on
the advent of rain; but those that have been burnt by gifts from the
king never grow again.’

Nārāyaṇa takes ‘*nadī*’ as standing for the *Vaitariṇī* river; while
Govindarāja takes it as by itsef forming the name of a particular hell.
The *Viṣṇupurāṇa* has a hell named ‘*Dīpanadī*’.

All these three verses are quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 185);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 15), which adds the following explanation of the
names:—

1.  ‘*Tāmisra*,’ darkness,
2.  ‘*Andhatāmisra*’, dense darkness,—
3.  ‘*Mahāraurava-Raurava*’, abounding in hot sands,—
4.  ‘*Kālasūtra*,’ resembling the potter’s cutting string,—
5.  ‘*Mahānaraka*’, where all sorts of dire sufferings are gone

7.  ‘*Mahāvīci*’, where large waves tumble about,—
8.  ‘*Tapana*’, resembling flaming fire,—
9.  ‘*Sampratāpana*’ is another name for the *Kumbhīpāka*,—
10. ‘*Saṃhāta*’ over-crowded,—
11. ‘*Kākola*’, where people are devoured by crows,—
12. ‘*Kuḍmala*,’ where there is whipping with cords,—
13. ‘*Pūtimṛttikam*’ where the earth smells like filth,—
14. ‘*Lauhaśaṅku*’, pricks like the needle,—
15. ‘*Ṛjīṣa*’, where rotten flour is thrown,—
16. ‘*Panthā*’, where one is constantly on the move,—
17. ‘*Śālmala*’, where people are pierced by thorns of the Śālmalī
    tree,—
18. ‘*Nadī*’, where one is washed away by such streams as the Vaitariṇī

This is the final summing up of the foregoing rules forbidding the
acceptance of gifts.

Knowing that the accepting of gifts from kings is the source of various
forms of suffering, learned Brāhmaṇas should not accept gifts from
kings.

‘*After death*’—*i.e*., in the next birth;—‘*welfare*’— good;—those who
desire. The term ‘*pretya*,’ which has the form of a participle, is a
totally different word.

‘*Brahma*’ is Veda; those who ‘*read*,’ study it.

The epithets, ‘*learned*’ and ‘*reading the Vedas*,’ have been added
with a view to indicate the excessive character of the suffering. Such
persons suffer the greatest pains, resulting from the said acceptance of
gifts; as it is going to be declared—‘the learned man should fight shy
of that.’—(91).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The night being divided into three parts, the last part is the ‘*point
of time sacred to Brahman*;’ and it is at this time that one should
renounce sleep.

Fully awakened at the said time, he shall ‘*think over the means of
acquiring merit (i.e., Duty) and Wealth*’; he should also think over the
bodily trouble involved in the performance of his duties (as bringing
merit); and if he finds that a certain duty is an unimportant one, and
yet its fulfilment involves much bodily trouble,—or, if he finds that it
stands in the way of another Duty,—then he shall omit such a duty.
Similarly, the means of acquiring *Wealth* also—such as service and the
like—are the source of much trouble; and this also shall be omitted; in
view of the principle that ‘one should protect oneself from all things.’

What is meant is that he should not do anything without having duly
thought over it, and that he should not indulge in building castles in
the air. It is the very nature of men that, when they are not outwardly
engaged, there arise in their minds many fancies, in the form of a
longing for obtaining what belongs to others, and so forth. And it is
the avoiding of this that the text lays down, with a view to the man’s
temporal interests.

At the said time, ‘*the true meaning of the Veda*’ should also be
thought over, in its bearing upon causes and effects. That is, one
should meditate, in the manner laid down in the Vedānta, upon the
esoteric science of the Soul. Or, in connection with the ritualistic
section of the Veda also, he should ponder over the real meaning of the
texts; that is, in his own mind he should determine that ‘this is an
Injunction,’ ‘this its meaning;’ ‘this the action prescribed,’ ‘this is
the form of the act,’ ‘this is the Deity of this sacrifice,’ ‘this the
material to be employed,’ ‘such and such a person is entitled to its
performance,’ ‘such and such is the procedure to be adopted,’ and so
forth. He should also ponder over the diverse explanations provided by
the Commentators, and with the help of reason, he should decide whose
explanation is correct and whose wrong.—(92).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 158);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 206), which explains ‘*Vedatattvārtha*’ as ‘the Supreme
Self’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p, 204);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
13), which explains ‘*Brāhma muhūrta*’ as ‘the last quarter of the
night’, and adds that the time is so called because it is the time for
the awakening of *Brāhmī*, *i.e*., Bhāratī, the goddess of speech; and
that the term ‘*muhūrta*’ is to be taken as standing for *time* in
general, and not in the restricted technical sense of a period of 48
minutes; and this on the ground that 48 minutes would not suffice for
all those acts that are prescribed for being done after rising and
before sunrise. It goes on to add that according to other *Nibandhas*,
the last but one *Muhūrta* (48 minutes) of the night is called ‘Brāhma’,
because it is sacred to Brahman. The conclusion that it arrives at is
that those who have to perform all the acts of Vedic study and the rest
should rise in the beginning of the last quarter of the night, *i.e*.,
at 3 a.m. while others in the third *Muhūrta* of that quarter, *i.e*.,
after 4-36 a.m. It explains ‘*Tanmūlān*’ as ‘due to those acts that are
done for the sake of Dharma and Artha’; and the purpose for which all
this is to be pondered over is that if the labour involved in a certain
act is much, while the resultant Dharma or Artha is little, then it is
to be avoided.—‘*Vedatattvārtha*’—here the term ‘*tattva*’ has been
added for the purpose of excluding such meanings as might be deduced by
wrong methods of interpretation; or ‘*Vedatattvārtha*’ might stand for
Brahman.

This verse is quoted in *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 4), which explains
‘*Vedatattvārtha*’ as god, but quotes Śrīdatta to explain it as
‘*nyāyapratītor’thaḥ*’; it explains ‘*brāhmamuhūrta*’ as the last but
one *muhūrta* of the night.

When the night has passed and the dawn appeared, he should leave his
bed.

‘*Necessities of nature*.’— Evacuating of the bladder and of the bowels.
As a rule, people do this act at that time; hence the evacuating has
been called a ‘necessity.’

‘*Purifications*;’—*i.e*., brushing of the teeth, &c. having done all
this; this is what is meant by ‘performing the purifications;’—*i.e*.,
having washed and cleansed himself, according to the rules laid down in

‘*With* *a* *collected mind*;’—*i.e*., withdrawing his mind from all
other thoughts.

‘*He shall stand during the morning twilight,—repeating—the Sāvitrī*;—he
shall fix his mind upon the god Sun—‘*for* *a long time*.’

The time of ‘twilight’ has been described as extending up to the
appearance of the Sun; and even longer than this, one shall go on
repeating the *Sāvitrī*, if he desire longevity. It is for the adding of
this prolongation that the afore mentioned Injunction regarding the
Twilight Prayers (See 2.101) has been reiterated. ‘*Also during the
evening twilight,—at its proper time*;’—*i.e*., beginning from sunset

यदर्थो ऽयं पुनर् विधिस् तद् दर्शयति । आयुरादिफलकामो दीर्घकालसंध्याजपं कुर्यात् । सत्य् अपि नित्यत्वे दैघ्याद् गुणात् फलम् इदम् । अनग्निकस्य प्रोषितस्यैतत् संभवति । अन्यस्य त्व् अग्निहोत्रकालोपरोधो दीर्घसंध्याविधिसंपादनात् । दीर्घसंध्या गुणत उच्यते । संध्यासहचरिते जपादिविधौ संध्याशब्दो वर्तते । दीर्घा संध्यैषाम् इति बहुव्रीहिः । **ऋषि**ग्रहणम् अर्थवादः ॥ ४.९४ ॥

The Author proceeds to show for what purpose the aforesaid act has been
prescribed. The meaning is that if one desires such rewards as long life
and so forth, he should perform the twilight-devotions for a long time.
Though the act is an obligatory one, yet the said rewards follow from
prolonging it.

This prolongation is possible only for one who is either without Fires,
or is away from home. As for others (*e.g*., the man with the Fires
living at home), the prolongation of the Twilight-Devotions would
inpinge upon the time laid down for the Agnihotra-offerings.

The twilight devotion is called ‘*prolonged*,’ only figuratively; the
term ‘twilight devotion’ standing for the reciting of Mantras, etc.,
that is done in connection with the said devotion.

The compound ‘*dīrghasandhyā*’ is a *Bahuvrīhi*.

The mention of the sages is by way of a commendatory statement—(94)

This verse is quoted in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 386), which explains that
‘*dīrghasandhyatva*’ is secured by continuing the Japa till after
sunrise.

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 104.18).—\[Same as Manu, reading
‘*nityasandhya*’ for ‘*dīrghasandhya*.’\]

*Yama* (in Parāśaramādhava, p. 300).—\[Same as Manu.\]
