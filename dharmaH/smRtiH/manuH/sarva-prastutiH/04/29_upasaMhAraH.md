<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This sums up the contents of the whole Discourse:—

“*Thus has been described the eternal course of life of the
Householder*,”—the ‘non-eternal’ one being that which shall be described
in connection with abnormal times.

The addition of the term, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ indicates that the observances
laid down are for the Brāhmaṇa Accomplished Student.

‘*Goodness*’—is a quality of the soul; and it is conducive to the
increase of this quality.

‘*Praiseworthy*’—excellent. All this is mere praise.—(259)

<details><summary>Bühler</summary>

259	Thus have been declared the means by which a Brahmana householder must always subsist, and the summary of the ordinances for a Snataka, which cause an increase of holiness and are praiseworthy.

This describes the result of all that has gone before.

‘*The Brāhmaṇa, learned in the Vedic scriptures, who conducts himself by
this course of life, has his sins*’—arising from doing what is
forbidden—‘*removed*’—by means of Expiatory Rites. The meaning is that
by doing what is enjoined, and by avoiding what is forbidden, and by
expiating by means of rites those sins that may happen to be
committed,—‘*becomes exalted in the region of Brahman*;— or, according
to another theory, be becomes of the same nature as Brahman—(260)

Thus ends Discourse IV.

This verse is quoted in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p, 42).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Gautama* (9.71).—‘The Accomplished Student who maintains this behaviour
saves from sin his parents and relations both above and below himself,
and fails not in attaining the regions of Brahman.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.17).—‘Ever bathing, ever wearing the sacred thread, ever
studying the Veda, avoiding the food of outcasts, approaching his wife
only during the periods, and offering oblations according to law, the
Brāhmaṇa fails not to reach the regions of Brahman.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.4.24).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who every day, during the day and
the night and the twilights offers prayers, becomes purified by Brahman
and becomes Brahman Itself; and following the scriptures, he wins the
regions of Brahman.’



*End of Adhyāya IV*.

260	A Brahmana who, being learned in the lore of the Vedas, conducts himself in this manner and daily destroys his sins, will be exalted in Brahman's world.
