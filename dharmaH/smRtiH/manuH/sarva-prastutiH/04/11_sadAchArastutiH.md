On the Parvas he should go to the gods, and to the righteous Brāhmaṇas, to the King for protection, and also to the superiors.—(153)


He shall salute the elders and give up his own seat to them; he shall wait upon them with joined hands; and when they depart, he shall follow behind them.—(154).


He shall, in his action, diligently attend to right conduct which is the root of Righteousness ordained in the Śruti and Smṛti.—(155)

**(verse 153)**

This verse has not been commented upon by Medhātithi.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 127);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
149), which explains ‘*abhigacchet*’ as ‘should approach, with a view to
worshipping’; and adds that the emphasising ‘*eva*’ should be construed
alter ‘*abhigacchet*’.

**(verse 154)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 149)

**(verse 155)**

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 12), which adds that
‘*ācāra*’ here spoken of is to be learnt from the people of the
‘Madhyadeśa’ and other countries mentioned in Discourse I.

It is not meant that the child is made equipped with learning and other
good qualities; in fact, such qualities are considered desirable in
children. Says an old text—‘What is to be done with the cow that does
not give milk nor bear calf; what is the use of a son being born who is
neither learned nor righteous?’

‘*Inexhaustible*—vast; which cannot become exhausted, even through
vices.

‘*Everything inauspicious*;’—such marks as a black spot on the shoulder,
and the like, which are indications of poverty, misfortune, etc. This
also is destroyed by Right Conduct.

Thus all that is unrighteous and evil is destroyed, if a man sticks to
Right Conduct.—(156)
