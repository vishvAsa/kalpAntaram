<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

An act, securing a benefit for others by requesting other (wealthy)
persons, is what is spoken of as ‘*dependent upon others*;’ and this has
to be avoided; and not such acts as are dependent upon one’s own
conduct; such, *e.g*., as *straightforwardness*, and the like; because
these are entirely under one’s own control; in fact, it is in view of
this that the man accepts payment for services rendered.

This text is not meant to forbid all those acts that are done for the
Initiated Sacrificer by the Priests in return for payment, and are, in
that sense ‘dependent on others.’ This cannot be the sense, because the
Smṛti could not set aside what has been ordained by the Śruti (such as
the Sacrificial acts are); specially as room for the application of the
Smṛti-rule (contained in the present text) is available in the case of
the acts mentioned before.

What is dependent upon oneself,—*e* .*g*., the helping of others with
small amounts of money, and so forth—should always be done.

In the event of one’s inability to perfom (perform?) one’s obligatory
duties, and in the event also of one’s not possessing wealth enough for
the maintaining of one’s family, one must have recourse to begging;
specially when one has no other means available. But when the man
himself possesses some little wealth, he shall remain contented, and
shall not crave for more, with a view to performing costlier sacrifices,
or making richer presents, and so forth. Such is the sense of the
verse.—(159)

This verse deprecates begging.

‘*All that is dependent on others is painful*;’—to say nothing of
attending at his gates, following in his wake, and wandering about here
and there (all which is involved in the act of begging). It has been
said that—‘the very idea of begging, the heart cannot bear,—it is
doubtless the greatest illusion; it is not a creation of the self-born
Creator.’

‘*In short*’—briefly. Pain is briefly defined as ‘begging,’ and Pleasure
as ‘absence of want’—(‘60)

The ‘soul’s satisfaction’, already mentioned before, is mentioned again
for recalling it to the mind; and its exact scope has already been
explained.

While an act is being performed, if there arises in the mind no sort of
doubt or hesitation, then that act should he proceeded with. But, if the
mind is not satisfied in regard to an action, that action should be
avoided.—(161)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 224), which explains ‘*Karma*’ as
‘*Dharma*’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 524);—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 14), which adds that the ‘act’ here mentioned must be such as is not
incompatible with the teachings of scriptures; though even in regard to
such acts, there are exceptions; *e.g*., even though an act may have
been enjoined by the scriptures, it should not be done if it is against
popular opinion;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 71b).
