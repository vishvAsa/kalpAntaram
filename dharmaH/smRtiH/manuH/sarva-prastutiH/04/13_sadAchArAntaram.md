‘*Preceptor*’—who initiated him.

‘*Teacher*’—who taught him, and explained to him (the Veda).

‘*Elder*’—other than the aforesaid two; *i.e*., the paternal uncle, the
maternal uncle, and so forth.

‘*Any persons performinq austerities*.’—The term ‘any’ has been added
with a view to include those sinners also who may be engaged in the
performance of Expiatory Rites.

In various places, the injuring of *all* living beings has been
forbidden: and some people think that the repetition of the same in the
present text is meant to forbid the injuring of even such Preceptors and
Teachers, etc., as may be great sinners and dangerous enemies; and that
what is stated in 8.350 regarding the propriety of striking ‘the
teacher, or the boy, or the old man,’ etc., is only a counter-exception
to what is forbidden in the present verse.

Our Teacher, however, says as follows:—The present verse is not a
‘prohibition,’ it is of the nature of ‘preclusion;’ and it is meant to
prescribe the determination (not to injure the persons, just like the
text—‘he shall not look at the rising sun,’ etc. Hence, the mere act of
injury having already gone before, the present may be taken as
forbidding even the *idea* of injuring the persons mentioned.

Or, the term ‘*hiṃsā*,’ ‘injury,’ may be taken to mean ‘the saying of
disagreeable words;’ in view of such expressions as ‘he *struck* her
with words.’

Or, the root ‘*hanti*’ (in ‘hiṃsa’) may he taken as used in the sense of
*acting against*.—(162).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Hiṃsyāt*’—‘Strike, or talk in an offensive manner, or act against’
(Medhātithi);—‘act against’ (Kullūka);—‘injure’ (Govindarāja).

‘*Tapasvinaḥ*’—‘All persons engaged in austerities, including those
engaged in expiatory penances’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘ascetics’
(Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 223);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.21),
in the sense that no injury should be inflicted upon the persons
mentioned, even though they attack one with murderous intent;—in
*Vyāvahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 118);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyāvahāra, p.
7a), which explains the meaning to be that the persons mentioned should
not be killed, even if they turn out to be ‘*ātatāyin*’, ‘dangerous
criminal’.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Āpastamba* (1.1.15).—‘He shall never hear ill-will towards him (the
Teacher).’

*Gautama* (2.15).—‘There should never be any misbehaviour towards
parents.’

*Mahābhārata* (Śānti, 132.9).—‘He shall never injure the Brāhmaṇas.’

*Viṣṇu* (30.43.47).—‘He shall never hear ill-will towards the person
from whom he acquires any knowledge, temporal or scriptural or
spiritual...... one who fills the ears with truth...... him one shall
regard as Father and as Mother, and shall never bear ill-will towards
him.’

He shall, avoid atheism, cavilling at the Vedas, abusing of the gods, hatred, haughtiness, pride, anger and hastiness.—(103)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Atheism*’ consists in thinking, as untrue, of things that are spoken
of in the Veda.

‘*Cavilling*’ is giving verbal expression to such ideas as—‘the Veda is
full of needless repetitions and self-contradictions,’ ‘there is nothing
true in it,’—with an evil intent, and not merely by way of propounding a
discussion on these points.

‘*Gods*’—*i.e*., Agni and the rest; the ‘abusing’ of these stands for
‘talking ill of them.’ *E.g*. people are found to make such assertions
as—‘we have been struck by the wretched gods.’

‘*Hatred*’—ill-feeling aroused by jealousy, etc.

‘*Haughtiness*’—want of humility, due to pride.

‘*Pride*’—Vanity regarding oneself: ‘I am very learned,’ ‘I am very
rich,’ and so forth.

‘*Anger*’—wrath.

‘*Harshness*’—cruelty; *i.e*., anger preceded by hatred, (163)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Stambham*’—‘Want of modesty’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘want of energy in the performance of duties’ (Kullūka).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.31.5).—‘He shall avoid harshness towards the
gods and the king.’

Do. (1.31.23).—‘He shall avoid anger and other bad feelings painful to
living beings.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (12.38).—‘Disbelief in the Vedas, reviling of the works of
sages, absence of restraint in all things,—all this is destructive of
the soul.’

*Viṣṇu* (71.83).—‘He shall avoid the reviling of the gods, Brāhmaṇas,
scriptures and great men.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 161.37).—(Same as Manu, but reading
‘*paranindāñca*’ for ‘*devatānāñca*.’)

‘*Daṇḍa*,’ ‘rod,’ is that whereby one *is struck*, ‘*daṇḍyate*;’ that
is, the hand, the stick, the whip, the rope, the split-bamboo, and so
forth.—This ‘*rod*’ ‘*he shall not raise, when angry, against another
person*;’ *i.e*., he shall not hold it up; nor shall he let it fall
down; *i.e*., bring it into contact with the other person’s body.

The son and the pupil one may strike with the whip, the split-bamboo, or
the slap,—as is going to be mentioned under Discourse VIII,—but not with
the *stick*. Further, these two are to be beaten, not in auger, but only
*with a view to correction*,’—*i.e*., for the purpose of correcting
them, if through boyishness, they happen to misbehave. And these two are
to be punished lightly, as is going to be laid down under 8.299.

The ‘*pupil*’ is meant to exclude the male and female slaves also; the
purpose served (*i*. *e*., correction) being the same in both
cases—(164).

*Cf*. 8.298-299 and 4.175.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 231), which adds:—‘*Śiṣya*’ here
means ‘one who has to be taught—the ‘son’ is mentioned separately with a
view to emphasis;—and in support of this it quotes the rule of Viṣṇu,
which is in the general form ‘*Śāsyam śāset tāḍayet*’.

person;—for disciplinary purposes, he shall beat his pupil, on the back,
either with a rope or a bamboo-piece.’
