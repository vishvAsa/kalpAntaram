The sacrifices prescribed in Discourse IV are reiterated here for the
purpose of laying down details in connection with them; these details
shall be described in the next verse.

Others think that the reiteration of these sacrifices under the
‘observances’ is for the purpose of establishing their obligatory
character; so that the man shall form the determination that ‘so long as
I continue to be a householder, I shall not omit the Five Great
Sacrifices.’

In any case, we should not entertain the idea that these have been
mentioned twice for the purpose of enjoining them twice over. Because,
in the present verse, we do not find any injunctive word; all that is
said is that ‘he shall not omit;’ and, as a matter of fact, this
‘non-omission’ is already implied by the obligatory character of the
sacrifices. And since we recognise in these sacrifices the same that
have been enjoined, before, there is no reason why they should be
regarded as distinct acts.

‘*To the beet of his power*’—*i.e*., with cooked food, or with uncooked
food, or with fruits and roots.—(21)

*Baudhāyana* (2. 6.1).—‘These are the five great sacrifices, these the
five great *Sattras*—the sacrifice to Gods, the sacrifice to Pitṛs, the

‘*Some persons*’—Householders—‘*Conversant with the ordinances relating
to sacrifices, offer these great sacrifices into the sense-organs*;’
*i.e*., they accomplish their performance in this manner.

Who are these people?

‘*Those who do not cherish any desires*;’—*i.e*., those who have no
desire for acquiring wealth, who have renounced the Vedic rituals.

Some people regard this verse as enjoining what is to be done by the
person living on ‘pickings and gleanings,’ as also by the lame and the
maimed,- That such persons also may marry wives is going to be declared
later on in 9-20. Such persons are not entitled to the regular
performance of the Five Sacrifices; for the simple reason that they can
never possess wealth sufficient for the performance of the sacrifices;
since they are to earn only enough for subsistence, and not any more
than that, which could be used in the performance of sacrifices.

The root ‘*hu*’ (in ‘*juhvati*,’ ‘offer,’) indicates the act of *doing*
in general. For the ‘sacrifice,’ which is a particular act, can never be
the object of ‘*homa*,’ which is another act; there can be no such
expression as ‘cooks the cooking;’ we have such expressions as ‘does the
cooking,’ ‘does the sacrifice.’ It is only when verbs stand in need of
objects in general that they get, for their auxiliaries, substances and
their operations; *e.g*., we have such expressions as ‘desires to eat,’
‘he is able to eat,’ ‘know to eat;’ and the particular (the part) is
often found to be used as indicative of the general (the whole), when,
for instance, one speaks of ‘the ox’ as to be examined ‘by its foot.’

Some people explain the ‘offering into the sense-organs’ to mean their
*restraining*.

Others, again, have explained it to mean what has been described in the
Upaniṣad (Chāndogya), where it is said that the first mouthful that one
eats in the morning and in the evening, should be put into the mouth as
an ‘oblation,’ with the formula ‘*prāṇāya svāhā*,’ and so forth.

Others, again, explain that the ‘offering’ here spoken of is the same as
what is enjoined in the next verse as a form of ‘worship;’ and it is
thus that the two verses become construed together.

“But, in the next verse, the life-breath is laid down as to be offered
into speech, and not into the *sense-organ* (as in the present verse).”

There is no force in the objection. The mention of the ‘sense-organs’
simply indicates the spiritual character of the offering; what is meant
is that this offering does not require any external accessories.—(22)

Whenever a man breathes, he should think—‘I am offering speech into
Life-breath;’ and when he speaks, he should think—‘I am offering
Life-breath into Speech.’ By this alone the Five Sacrifices become
accomplished.

“If these are obligatory, they should not be spoken of as leading to any
results.”

As a matter of fact, only such persons are entitled to this form of
sacrifice as are cognisant of the real nature of the Soul.

This same fact has been laid down in the Upṇniṣads, in connection with
‘the worship of the Five Fires,’ and in great detail in the *Kauṣitaki
Brāhmaṇa*.

‘*Imperishable*’—in their results; their results consisting in
non-return to the cycle of birth and rebirth.—(23)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

**(verses 4.23-24)  
**

*Kauṣītaki-Brāhmaṇa*.—‘While the man breathes, he does not speak; at
that time he offers speech unto breath; while he speaks, he does not
breathe; then ho offers breath unto speech; these two arc the endless
oblations, offered during sleep as also during waking hours;—other
oblations are an end; those that consist of acts. In this manner have
the Ancient Sages offered the Agnihotra-oblations.’

*Mahābhārata* (Bhagavadgītā, 6.25-333).—‘The Yogins have recourse to a
different sacrifice, the Daiva sacrifice; other Yogins have recourse to
another sacrifice offered into the fire of Brahman. Others again offer
the auditory and other organs into the fire of Restraint; others offer
sound and the other objects into the fire of the sense-organs. Others
offer all sense-functions and breath-functions into the fire of the Yoga
of self-restraint, enkindled by wisdom. Sages fixed in their observances
offer the sacrifice of substances, the sacrifice of austerities, the
sacrifice of Yoga, the sacrifice of Vedic Study and the sacrifice of
Knowledge. They offer the Prāṇa unto the Apāṇa, and the Apāṇa unto
Prāṇa; and restraining the function of Prāṇa and Apāṇa, devoted to
breath-control, restrained in their food, they offer Prāṇa unto the
Prāṇas. All these are persons well-versed in sacrifices and have their
sins destroyed by sacrifices. O Suppressor of enemies, the sacrifice of
knowledge is superior to the sacrifice of substances; all action, O
Pārtha, culminates in knowledge.’

‘*By these sacrifices*,’—by the Five great sacrifices under
treatment—‘*they sacrifice*,’—i.e., accomplish their duty in relation to
them. It is in this sense that there is difference in the denotations of
the two terms, ‘sacrifice’ and ‘sacrifices,’—between which the text
speaks of the relation of cause and effect; just as we have in the
expression, ‘he who sacrifices with the *Agniṣṭoma* sacrifice.’

*Question*:—“ How can the *sacrifice* be accomplished by means of
*knowledge*? *Sacrifice* consists in the act of offering a certain
material for the benefit of a deity; and certainly *knowledge* is not of
the nature of such au act.”

Our answer is as follows s—By the term ‘sacrifice’ in the present verse
what is meant is *the accomplishment of the act of sacrificing*.

“If such accomplishment were brought about by *knowledge* alone, for
what purpose would there be the performance of the act itself? The
performance of an act cannot be entirely objectless. If your idea be
that—‘since the Veda speaks of the reward of an act accruing also to the
man having *knowledge* of it, there is no need of the actual performance
at all,’—this cannot be right; as the passage referred to is only a
commendatory description subserving the purposes of some other passage.”

To this we make the following reply:—We have already pointed out that
the persons entitled to the performance of the sacrifices in question
are those that have realised the true nature of the Soul and are
entirely free from desires. And it is these persons that are spoken of
as ‘possessing knowledge,’ and not those who have the knowledge *of the
act*. What the present text means is that such persons, having given up
the Veda, but continuing in the house, should accomplish the great
sacrifices in this manner. That is to say, it is only by means of
knowledge of the Soul that such persons can accomplish such sacrifices
as can be performed only with the help of wealth (which these men have
renounced); but, as regards the two duties of Teaching and offering
water-libations, it is going to be declared in Discourse VI, that these
can be accomplished only by the actual performance of the acts (and not
by knowledge of the Soul).

The text adds a commendatory declaration, by way of pointing out the
reason for what has been said above.

‘*Having its root in Knowledge*,’—*i.e*., that act which has its root in
Knowledge. Knowledge stands at the root of all acts; an ignorant person
cannot perform any act at all. This is what has been said in such
passages—as—‘the learned man sacrifices.’

‘*Looking with the eye of Knowledge*.’—The Knowledge being as if it were
the Eye; just as colour is perceived bymeans of the eye, so is the
matter known by means of knowledge.

‘*Knowledge*’ here does not stand for the *Veda* alone—(24).

The terms ‘*agnihotra*’ and the rest are found used in the Veda and in
the Gṛhyasūtra texts, in the sense of particular rites; and these rites,
along with their procedure, are prescribed in these texts. And it is to
these rites that the present verse makes a *reference*; it does not
contain the original injunction of the rites; specially, as it speaks of
their *form* only; *i.e*, all that the present verse mentions is the
necessity of performing the act of *offering* only,—and it does not
mention either the material to be offered, or the deity to whom it is to
be offered. And yet the names ‘*Agnihotra*’ and the rest, stand in need
of the mention of detailed particulars; hence it follows that what is
implied is that the detailed particulars of these rites are to be learnt
from other treatises.

“If that be so, then, since the necessity of performing the rites also
could be learnt from those same treatises, there is no use for the
present text at all.”

The use of the present text lies in adjusting the necessity of
performing these acts, in the case of persons who have renounced Vedic
rituals, with the form of worship laid down in the present context; the
sense being that just as, according to what has been said regarding some
people offering ‘the life-breath into speech,’ and so forth, the Five
Great Sacrifices are performed by such men, by means of *Knowledge*
alone,—so are the sacrificial rites mentioned in the present verse also.
Then again, what sort of objection is this that you urge, when you
ask—‘Why should there he a repeated mention?’ As a matter of fact, in
the case of the Vedic and Smṛti texts, it is found that what is said in
one part of it is said again in another part; and all this would be open
to objection (according to you). Lastly, we have already provided the
general answer to such objections;—*viz*., that since the persons meant
to be enlightened are many, the texts cannot be regarded as needless
repetitions at all. Just as, by reason of the perceiv-ers being many,
there are many organs of perception, and all men cannot see with one eye
only, and there is need of several such organs,—so also is the case with
the diverse Vedic and Smṛti texts.

The question might be raised—“Why should the mere name of the rites be
mentioned?”

There is nothing objectionable in this also. Since the procedures as
laid down in the several Vedic texts are divergent, which particular
procedure could the verse mention? If it were to mention all, there
would be prolexity; and if it were to mention any *one* only, this would
involve the abandoning of the others.

“Even so, the omission is open to objection.”

But we have already pointed out that the present verse contains only a
*reference*, and not an *Injunction*. It is only an Injunction, against
which the objection can be urged that—‘the act being already enjoined
elsewhere, why should it be enjoined again?’

‘*At the beginning and end of dag and night*;’—this is not meant to be
construed respectively. What is meant is—‘at the beginning of day and
beginning of night,’ and ‘at the end of day and end of night;’ and by
this, *morning and evening* are meant. For those who follow the practice
of making the offerings *after sunrise*, the offering shall be made ‘at
the beginning of day;’ while for those who follow the practice of making
the offerings *before sunrise*, it shall be made ‘at the end of night.’

The term ‘*dyu*’ here is synonymous with ‘*Divasa*,’ ‘day.’

‘*Always*,’—*i.e*., throughout one’s life, one should offer these
morning and evening libations.

In connection with ‘*darśena*,’ it is necessary to supply the root
‘*yajeta*’; as the original injunction of the *Darśa-sacrifice* does not
contain the verb, ‘*juhuyāt*,’—the injunction being in the form
‘*darśena yajeta*;’ and the prfesent verse makes only a reiterative
reference to what is prescribed in that injunction; and thus (it being
impossible to construe ‘*darśena*’ with the verb ‘*juhuyāt*’ in the
verse) it becomes necessary to supply the verb ‘*yajeta*.’ For this same
reason, though the text does not make any specification, the phrase,
‘*at the end of half-month*’ should be understood to mean that the
*Darśa* is to be performed at the end of the darker fortnight, and the
*Paurṇamāsa* (*Pūrṇamāsa*) at the end of the brighter fortnight. Says
the *Śruti*—‘One should perform the *Darśa* sacrifice on the Moonless
Day and the *Paurṇamāsa* on the Full Moon Day.’—(25)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 217), which makes the following
observations:—The ‘ends of night and day’ being laid down as the times
fit for the making of the two *Agnihotra* offerings,—the points of time
really meant are also those immediately preceding and following the said
‘ends’; it is on this understanding that the evening-offering is
commenced in the *afternoon* and finished after the evening; and for
those who adopt the alternative of making the offering ‘after sunrise,’
it is done after the sun has actually risen, (which would naturally be
*after* the end of the night). Similarly as the exact point of time
denoted by the term ‘*Darśa*’ would be too minute for any act, it stands
for such length of time as may be necessary for the entire offering.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*sasya*,’ ‘*grains*,’ stands for the *Vrīhi* and other
grains;—‘*end*’ means *exhaustion*. The meaning is that when the
previous supply of grains has become exhausted, he shall perform the
‘New-Harvest Sacrifice,’ *i.e*., the *Āgrayaṇa* sacrifice.

This does not mean that either the exhaustion of the previous supply of
grain, or the coming in of the new harvest, is the reason or occasion
for the performance of the *Āgrayaṇeṣṭi*; what is meant is that the
eating of new grain is prohibited, until one has performed the
*Āgrayaṇeṣṭi*. This is what has been said in the following text—‘Without
having offered the sacrifice, one should not eat new grain.’ On these
grounds, some people explain the verse to mean that ‘since one cannot
eat new grains without having performed the *Āgrayaṇa* sacrifice, one
shall perform this sacrifice.’

But, according to this explanation, it would mean that—if there has been
no previous grain-supply, or, if there is no fresh grain-supply, or, if
one has no desire to eat new grains, it would not he necessary to
perform the *Āgrayaṇa* sacrifice. If the ‘end of previous supply’ be
taken to be indicative of the coming in of the new supply \[and there
were nothing to prohibit the eating of new grains before performing the
sacrifice\], then it becomes possible to eat the new grain without
having performed the sacrifice.

For these reasons, we conclude that here we have two declarations—(*a*)
‘he shall not eat without having performed the sacrifice’ (next verse)
and (*b*) ‘at the end of the grains, &c.’ (present verse). The ‘end of
grains’ is meant to stand for the coining of the new grain; since the
*coming in* is certain, and as such can serve as the occasion for the
sacrifice. The ‘end’ or ‘exhaustion’ (of the former supply), on the
other hand, is uncertain; since, in the case of rich men, there are
supplies that may last for three years. It is for these reasons that the
author of the *Sūtra* has declared—

‘Without having performed the *Agnihotra*, one shall not eat out of the
harvest,’ and ‘When one is satisfied for the year, one shall perform the
Āgrayaṇa,’—and, further, ‘The new-grain sacrifice is to be doue in the
autumn this last laying down the time for the sacrifice. So that the
man, for whom there is no ‘end of the former supply,’ will observe the
rule regarding autumn being the time for the sacrifice; which will not
be done by another person (for whom there is ‘end of former supply’). In
this way, both the declarations are found to have their use. If this
were not the meaning, then the author would have said simply—‘On the
coming of the new harvest, he shall perforin the New-Harvest Sacrifice.’
Since, however, the author says—‘without having performed the
New-Harvest Sacrifice, one shall not eat of the new grains,’ it follows
that even when the new harvest has come iu, if the man happen to have
old corn left, he may wait-till the autumn (for the performance of the
sacrifice); and, since the coming in of the new harvest forms the
occasion for the sacrifice, the performance of the *Āgrayaṇa* is
obligatory, even when the man has no desire to eat new grains.

‘*At the end of the seasons*’—According to the theory that ‘the *season*
constitutes the year,’ what this portion of the text lays down is the
performance of the *Cāturmāsya* sacrifices; in fact, it is these
sacrifices that are referred to by the term ‘*adhvara*,’

‘*End of the solstices*’ means ‘beginning of the two solstices’;—the two
solstices being the ‘northern’ and the ‘southern.’ At these, one shall
perform the ‘Animal-Sacrifice,’ twice during the year. The author of the
Sutra has said—‘This sacrifice is either six monthly or yearly.’

‘*At the end of the year*.’—The term ‘*samā*’ is synonymous with ‘year;’
and the ‘end’ of this is the *śiśira*, the later winter season. The
present verse does not mean that the Soma-sacrifice shall be performed
during the winter; what is meant is that—‘when the winter has passed and
the spring has arrived, the Soma-sacrifice shall be performed.’ Says the
*Śruti*—‘At each spring-season, one shall perform the *Jyotiṣṭoma*
sacrifice.’

What the whole text means is that these constitute the obligatory rites,
and, as such, shall be performed, somehow or the other, by even those
who have renounced Vedic rituals.—(26).

The term ‘*Agnimān*’ must stand here for one who has set up the Fire;
because ‘observances’ form the subject matter of the context; and it is
in connection with the *Agnihotra-homa* that we have ‘observances’ laid
down in the Yajur-veda.

Without having performed the Animal Sacrifice, he shall not eat meat,
nor shall be eat new grain without having performed the New-Harvest
Sacrifice.

The text next describes the reward accruing from the observing of this
rule—‘*if he desires to live a long life*.’ The term, ‘*āyu*,’ ‘life,’
denotes the function of the out-and-in-breathings operating
continuously. Even though the verb, to live,’ is intransitive, yet we
have the accusative ending, in view of the action of ‘desiring,’—this
act of *desiring* being expressed by the verb (‘to live) as ending in
the desiderative affix ‘*san*.’ Though, as a matter of fact, the object
of the act of ‘desiring’ is what is denoted by the root to which the
desiderative is affixed (*i.e*., *living*), and not anything outside the
desiderative term itself,—and the *desire* is subordinate to *what is
desired*,—yet there need be nothing incongruous in the suggested
construction, in view of the dictum that ‘the basic term and the affix
jointly denote what is expressed by the affix’; so that the accusative
ending may be attributed to what is expressed by the desiderative word
as a whole. According to this view also, the term ‘*āyti*’ ‘life,’ would
he indicative of a period of *time*, the meaning being ‘if he desires a
life lasting for a long time.’ So that the accusative would he due to
the dictum that ‘in the case of intransitive verbs, the time-period may
be regarded as an object.’

This rule, relating to the man with the Fire performing the Animal
Sacrifice, applies to the case of the *Āgrayaṇa* sacrifice also. Because
the Gṛhya texts have prescribed the *Āgrayaṇa* as an obligatory rite for
one who has only the domestic fire.

As for the rule that ‘the New-Harvest Sacrifice is to be performed in
the autumn,’ this refers to the *Vrīhi* and the *Śyāmāka* grains, not to
the *Yava*. Nor is it necessary to perform the Harvest-Sacrifice at each
and every harvest; nor is it performed with such grains as the *Māṣa*,
the *Mudga*, and the like. That all this is so follows from the fact
that the present text is dependent upon other scriptural injunctions,
and it is not itself a self-sufficient injunction, as we have already
explained. And in other scriptural injunctions it has been laid down
that the *Āgrayaṇeṣṭi* is to be performed with the *Vrīhi*, the
*Śyāmāka* and the *Yam*.

Though this is so, yet other. grains also should not be eaten, until the
*Āgrayaṇeṣṭi* has been performed; since it has been stated in general
terms that ‘he shall eat *no new grains* and if the author had meant to
prohibit the eating of only those grains with which the *Āgrayaṇeṣṭi* is
performed, then he should have said—‘He shall not eat the *Vrīhi*, the
*Śyāmāka* and the *Yava*, until he has made the offering;’ while what
the author of the *Sūtra* has said is—‘The Āgrayaṇa is to be performed
with the *Vrīhi*, the *Śyāmāka* and the *Vara*; *one shall eat no new
grains* until one has made the offering;’ so that the term ‘*grain*’
cannot stand for any particular grains only.—(27).
