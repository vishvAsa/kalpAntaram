The full moon day related to the asterism of *Śravaṇā* is called
‘*Śrāvaṇī*;’ similarly, ‘*Prauṣṭhapadī*.’—On either of these
days,—‘*having performed the rite known as* “*Upākarma*,”’—he shall
study the Vedas,—‘*according to rule*;’ this refers to the rules laid
down under 2.75 *et seg*.—*Yukta*—applying himself with diligence.

‘*Chandāṃsi*’— the Vedas. The term ‘*chandas*’ here stands for the Veda,
and not for the metres, *Gāyatrī* and the rest. Hence this same rule
applies also to the case of those who are studying the *prose-Brāhmaṇas*
(and is not restricted to those studying the metrical *saṃhitā* texts
only). It is only right that the rule should be so applicable, as both
(prose and metrical portions) are equally regarded as ‘Veda.’ In this
connection, the option referred to has been restricted to the extent
that the students of the Sāma-Veda perform the ‘Upākarma’ on the
full-moon day of *Bhādrapada*, while those of the Ṛgveda and the
Yajurveda do it on that of *Śrāvaṇa*—(95)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.142) to the effect that the
Veda is to be studied for four months and a half;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 518), which explains the compound ‘*ardhapāñcamān*’ as
‘*ardham pāñcamam yeṣām*’, *i.e*., four months and a half; and adds that
if on the day here specified there happen to be such conditions
antagonistic to study, as the non-appearance of the Venus and the
like—then the Upākarma should be performed on the Full-moon day of the
month of *Āṣāḍha*.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 499);—and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 84), which also explains the compound
‘*ardhapañcamān*’ as ‘*ardhāḥ pañcamo māso yeṣām*’;—*i.e*., for four
months and a half, counting from the day on which the *Upākarma*
ceremony is performed. It adds that this rule is applicable, not to the
Student only, but to the House-holder also.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 512), which adds that according to
the explanation provided by Hemādri, the particle ‘*api*’ is meant to
include the fifth day of the month of *Bhādrapada* as another
alternative day.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 186), which explains the construction
as—‘*Chandāṃsi upākṛtya tāni ardhapañcamān māsān adhīyīta*’; and
explains the compound ‘*ardhapāñcamān*’ as ‘*ardhaḥ pāñcamo māso
yeṣām*’;—the meaning being that from the day that the *Upākarma* is
performed, the man should go on studying the Veda for four months and a
half;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 298) as laying down Vedic study to be
done during four months and a half, during both the dark and the bright
fortnights;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 396), which adds that the particle
‘*api*’ is meant to imply the ‘*Bhādrapada—Śravaṇā—Hastā* and
*Pañcamī*’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 171), which says that the
*Chandogas* are to do the *Upākarma* on the Full-moon day of
*Bhādrapada*, while all others are to do it on the same day in
*Śrāvaṇa*;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 147), which explains
‘*yuktaḥ*’ as ‘with due application.’

On the expiry of the four months and a half, when the *Puṣya* asterism
comes for the first time,—on that day, one should perform the
‘Utsarjana’ rite. The exact form of this rite has been described by the
authors of the *Gṛhyasūtras*.

*^(‘)Outside*’—*i.e*., in an uncovered place.

The exact form of these two rites—The ‘*Upākarma*’—and the ‘*Utsarjana*’
should be learnt from the *Gṛhyasūtras*.—(96)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 186), which adds that ‘if the
*Upākarma* has been performed on the Full-moon day of *Śrāvaṇa*, then
the *Utsarjana* should be performed on the first day of the bright
fortnight of *Pauṣa*, while if the *Upākarma* has been done in
*Bhādrapada*, then the *Utsarjana* should be done in *Māgha*’.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.143) to the effect that if the
*Upākarma* has been done in *Bhādrapada*, the *Utsarjana* should be done
in *Māgha*;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 521), which adds the same
two options as *Aparārka*;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 95), which also notes
the same two options;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 297), which says that
if the *Upākarma* has been done in Śrāvaṇa then the *Utsarjana* should
be done in Pauṣa, on the first day of the bright fortnight; but if the
former has been done in Bhādra then the latter should be done in Māgha
on the same day;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 405), which adds the same
remark;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 129), which has the same note;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 147), which says that ‘*śukla pratipadi

The term ‘*verse*’ stands for the ‘*Gāyatrī*’ and other metres; and the
Veda *with* these, is the *Ṛgveda*, and also the *Sāma Veda*. The term
‘*kṛta*’ is used here in the sense of *association*, the root ‘*kṛ*’
having several significations, it is explained as denoting ‘association’
in the present context. The root ‘*kṛ*’ has the sense of ‘*collecting*’
in such expressions as ‘*gomayān kuru*’ (collect cowdung),—it has the
sense of *rubbing*, in the expression ‘*pṛṣṭham kuru*’ (Rub the back);
similarly, in the present text it means ‘association.’

‘*Brahmachandaskṛtam*’—that which is in verse and prose. In the
Yajurveda, there are prose-passages, as also Mantras composed in the
*Gāyatrī* and other metres; both kinds of passages being found in the
same chapter. It is not so in the Ṛgveda or in the Sāma Veda; in both of
which the *mantras* (in metre) form one part and the *Brāhmaṇas* (prose)
form a distinct part. It is on the basis of this difference in the
character of the Vedas that the text mentions them in the way in which
it has done. Thus have the older writers explained the text.

‘*According to rule*’—This sums up the rules laid down in connection
with normal times. In abnormal times, one would need the presence of the
Teacher for enlightening him regarding the distinction mentioned in the
text; and if, on that account, he were not to repeat the texts, he would
forget them; hence, in this case, the aforesaid distinction need not be
observed.—(100)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Gautama* (quoted in commentary on Gobhila, p. 64).—‘There is no

When the wind blows with force, a sound is heard, which is produced by
the impact of another (contrary) wind; this is what is called the ‘*air
audible by the ear*.’ That which is heard by the ears is called
‘*audible by the ear*;’ the compound being between the instrument (ear)
and the noun formed by a verbal affix. The term ‘ear’ is added for the
purpose of indicating a particular condition, because hearing is always
by means of ears. The meaning is that ‘when the sound of wind is heard,
study should not be carried on.’

‘*Dust-whorl*’—that which brings together dust; ‘*pāṃsu*’ meaning
*dust*; this is mentioned only as indicative of the wind that produces
it (*i.e*., the dust-storm). The meaning is that ‘after it has rained,
whenever such a wind blows, that time shall be regarded as unfit for
study.’

regulating the practice of teaching.—(102)

‘*Vidyut*’— lightning;—‘*stanita*’—thunder. The copulative compound
indicates that it is ‘time unfit for study’ only when all these appear
simultaneously.

‘*Meteor*’—is the name given to the light emanating from the stars that
fall from the sky;—‘*the promiscuous falling*’ of these is their falling
here and there.

The term ‘*ākālikam*’ stands for the time beginning from the occurrences
mentioned and ending with the same time on the following day.

is to be observed in the evening;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
194);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*, (p. 57), which adds the following notes:—all
the three phenomena are to be taken collectively here, on account of the
copulative compound—says Medhātithi; according to Hemādri, each is to be
taken separately; what is said here refers to the rainy season;
‘*ākālikam*’ means ‘from the time of the occurrence to the same time on
the morrow’; ‘Lightning and the rest’ are to be treated as ‘occasions of
holiday’ only when they occur either in the morning or in the

the phenomena referred to should occur in the evening, or morning, and
that there is no ‘holiday’ due to the mere appearance of clouds during

*Dharmaprakāśa* to the effect that ‘*prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu*’ (morning and
evening) is to be taken with the ‘appearance of clouds’ also;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 194);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 566),
which explains ‘*prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu*’ as ‘at the times when the fire is
kindled for the morning and evening Libations’, *i.e*., morning and
evening, and the verse as meaning—‘when the three phenomena of lightning
and the rest are perceived during the season (Rains), then one day and
night should be treated as holiday’, and *apart from the Rainy season*,
if mere clouds appear in the morning or evening, one day and night
should be observed; but not so during the rains; the particle ‘*ca*’
implies that when lightning and thunder are heard apart from the Rainy
season, there will be a holiday for one day and night;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 149), which explains ‘*prāduṣkaraṇa*’, as
‘*viharaṇa*’, furbishing,—and says it denotes the Twlights.

*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 197) quotes the opinion of *Kalpataru* to
the effect that on the appearance of each of the phenomena individually,
only the time of the appearance is to be treated as holiday. It adds
that the accepted practice is that whenever dense clouds appear, apart
from the Rains, it is treated as a holiday.

The previous verse (103) has declared that when the three
phenomena—lightning, thunder and rain—appear together, it is to be
regarded as ‘time unfit for study,’ till the same hour next day. The
present verse declares that when only two of these appear together, it
is unfit for study till the fights are seen.

The compound ‘*stanitaniḥsvanaḥ*’ means the *roaring of thunder*; and
this, with the term ‘*vidyut*,’ forms the copulative compound
‘*vidyut-stanitaniḥsvanaḥ*.’ When these two appear at twilight, it is to
be regarded as time unfit for study ‘*till the lights are there*.’
During the day, the sun is the ‘*light*,’ a nd during the night fire is
the ‘*light*,’ So that, if the phenomena appear at morning twilight, it
is unfit for study only during the day, not at night; similarly if they
appear at evening twilight, it is unfit for study during the night; and
there is nothing wrong in reading in the morning.

From among the three phenomena (mentioned in 103)—lightning, thunder and
rain’—two have been mentioned here separately. So that ‘rain’ is the
‘*remaining*’ phenomenon; and when this third phenomenon appears, it is
unfit for study till the same time next day. It is in view of this that
it is said ‘*during the night as also during the day*.’

Another reading is ‘*śeṣam*,’ which means the *remaining portion*, of
the well-known sacrifices of *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the rest; the sense being
that ‘the day on which these sacrifices are performed, the whole of that
day is unfit for study.’

“Wherefore did not the Author say simply—‘*śeṣam tvākālikam smṛtam*’
(which would be much simpler)?”

Manu’s methods of composing his texts are most peculiar.—(106).

“If these sounds are heard in the morning twilight, there should be no
study till the sun is up; when they are heard in the evening twilight,
there is to be no reading till the stars appear;—or if the two
disturbances occur, the intermission lasts as long as the sun or stars
remain; but if it also rains, then, as long as the day and night”
(Kullūka).—For ‘*śeṣe*’ Medhātithi notes another reading ‘*śeṣam*’ and
explains it to mean that ‘on the day that one offers the *Jyotiṣṭoma*
and other well-known sacrifices, the *śeṣa, remainder* of that day, is
to be regarded as *unfit for study*.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 526), which adds
that this refers to the Rainy season,—in other seasons, the whole day
and night is unfit for study;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 763), which has the
following notes:—When the phenomenon appears in the morning the holiday
extends as long as the Sun does not set, and if in the evening, then
till the setting of the stars; ‘*śeṣe*’, *i.e*., if it comes to rain,
then it is holiday during the day as well as during the night;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56), which has the following notes—‘*Prāduṣkṛteṣu*
*etc*.,’ *i.e*., the morning and evening,—‘*sajyotiḥ*’ means that if it
happens in the evening then the whole night is ‘holiday’—‘*śeṣe*’, if it
rains, then the whole day and night; all this only when it occurs during
the Rainy season; in other seasons, these phenomena lead to a three
days’ holiday;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 150), which has the same
note, but explains ‘*śeṣe*’ as ‘*ṛtau*’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla,
p. 194);—and in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 566), which has ṭhe following
notes:—This lays down special rules regarding mere thundering during the
rains: if there is thundering in the morning, the entire day time is to
be kept as holiday; and if it occurs in the evening, then the night
only; ‘*śeṣe*’, *i.e*., on the occasion of the thunder and the rest
developing into rain, both the day and night are to be observed. The
‘Rainy season’ is here meant to stand for all the four months during
which there are rains. —*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla p. 197) notes that
there is to be holiday when there is not merely rain, but rain
accompanied by lightning and thunder, according to the rule as laid down
in the first part of the verse; the last part sets forth the rule for
cases of rain only.

goes to sleep; on the next day, if there has been thunder during the
preceding night; but only if this has been after midnight, say some.’

Those who desire perfect merit, should not study in villages and
cities.—The term, ‘*dharma*,’ ‘*merit*’ *stands* for the *result* of
merit, in the shape of Heaven, &c. Or, the ‘perfection of merit’ may
consist in freedom from all contact with demerit; whereby the entire
purport of an Injunction becomes fulfilled. This would imply that the
said study may be permissible in cases of disability.

‘*Foul-smelling places*.’— There should be no studying in a place where
evil smell reaches the nose.

In a village where a corpse still lies,—*i.e*., while the corpse has not
been taken away.

‘*Low people*.’— This term does not stand here for the *Śūdra*; as the
‘proximity of the Śūdra’ has been already forbidden under 4.99. It
denotes *unrighteousness*, and stands for such people as are similar to
Śūdra, in their unrighteousness. Hence there is prohibition of study
even in the presence of such people as are unrighteous in their conduct.

‘*During weeping*,’—where the Sound of weeping is heard; the participial
term ‘*rudyamāne*’ being used as a noun.

‘*In a crowd of people*.’— One shall not study in a place where a large
number of men have congregated on some business.

Or, the meaning may be—‘*where a crowd of people are weeping*;’ the

The fourth ‘*muhūrta*’ of the night is ‘*midnight*,’ which is also
called ‘*mahāniśā*,’ ‘Deep Night.’ Two ‘*muhūrtas*’ before, and two
‘*muhūrtas*’ after this ‘midnight,’ it is unfit for study.

‘*In water*;’—*i.e*., while standing in a river or tank or some such
reservoir of water. Since the context is dealing with

‘Vedic study,’ the repeating of Vedic texts—such as ‘*Aghamarṣana*,’ and
the rest—in water is not forbidden.

Some people read ‘*udaye*’ for ‘*udake*;’ which means that it is unfit
for study when the sun has just risen.

‘*Unclean*;’—*i.e*., while he has not washed, after having taken his
food. One is also called ‘unclean’ before one has washed, after having
evacuated the bladder or the bowels. Some people explain that the term
‘*unclean*’ stands for all those impure conditions that require washing;
so that spitting also would become included.

‘*Even in his mind*.’—This does not mean that on other occasions unfit
for study, the *thinking* of Vedic texts is permitted; all that it means
is that the conditions here mentioned are more serious than the

The ‘Unitary Rite’ is that which is offered to a single ancestor;
*i.e*., the fresh funeral rite (that which is performed after
death);—having ‘*accepted*’—agreed to—‘*invitation*’ at that rite, it
becomes an occasion unfit for study, for three days, counting from the
day of the invitation.

Similarly, when ‘*of the King*’—*i.e*., of the Moon—there is
‘*impurity*,’ *i.e*., pouring of nectar towards Rāhu. ‘*Also*’ in this
case, is meant to include the *Sun* also.

Or, the ‘*impurity of the King*’ may mean the rejoicings accompaying the
birth of a son to the *King*, the ruler of men; and the ‘*impurity of
the Rāhu*,’ for the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, known as
‘*grahaṇa*,’ ‘catching.’—(110)

‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’—Burnell was right in rendering this as ‘to one ancestor,’
and Hopkins is *not* right in changing it into ‘to one recently
deceased.’ As a matter of fact ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’ is the name applied to the
*Śrāddha* to a *single* person,—as distinguished from the *Pāravaṇa*
which is offered to *six* ancestors,—whether he has died long ago or
only recently.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 190), which explains ‘*Ketanam*’
as ‘invitation’,—at this, and on an eclipse, either one day or three
days should be unfit for study,—‘*Rāhusūtaka*’ meaning ‘the sign of
Rāhu;’—in the *Dānakriyākaumudī* (p. 99), as forbidding study for three
days from the day of invitation;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 195),
which adds the same note and explains ‘*Ketana*’ as ‘invitation’;—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 407), which explains ‘*Ketana*’ as
‘invitation,’ and ‘*pratigraha*’ as ‘the acceptance of a gift made by
the donor for gaining spiritual merit’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 58),
which has the following notes:—Some people say that it is not right that
in the case of the Śrāddha on death, the invited should desist from
study only till the food eaten has become digested, and in that of
subsequent *Ekoddiṣṭas* it should be for three days; and they hold that
the former is meant for cases of *unintentional* eating and the latter
for those of *intentional* eating;—the writer himself holds the view
that the ‘three days’ are meant for cases of *first* Śrāddha also;’—in
*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 442);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
153).—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.146) to the effect that an invitation to an
Ekoddiṣṭa means the omission of study for three days;—in *Hemādri*

uncooked food is offered;—while of such a rite the ‘*odour and stain

the forgoing rule. When on the next day, the man has bathed, and the

What is said here is only by way of an iṇḍicatipn. Even while the ‘odour
and stain’ are not actually there, the man shall hot study, until the
food eaten has become digested.

‘*Gomāyu*’—is the jackal; the ‘howling’ of the jackal is its *crying*.

together in large numbers; each of these three crying along with others
of the same species.—(115).

‘*Paṅktau*’—Buhler entirely misrepresents Kullūka; Kullūka does not
explain the term as ‘in a company’; he clearly explains that what is

horses, camels or asses’; while Medhātithi explains the meaning to be
that ‘that time is unfit for study when the animals named cry out in a
line

The term ‘*anta*’ means *proximity*. The meaning is that he shall not

‘*Cow-pasture*’—where cows goto graze. Or, ‘*govraja*’ may mean the
‘*cow-pen*.’

‘He shall not read with the same cloth on him which he had on while
having intercourse with his wife;’ the term ‘*maithuna*’ denoting,

been washed after the act;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 770), which explains
‘*ante*’ as ‘near’ and ‘*maithunam vāsaḥ*’ as ‘the cloth, clad in which
he has had sexual intercourse’; he should not wear this—without its
being washed—while reading;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56);—in

The rice and other things that are given in connection with *Śrāddhas*
are generally known as ‘*śrāddhika*,’ ‘*śrāddha-gift*;’ and it is with a
view to show that, in the present context it is not this alone that is
meant, that the present verse is added; the sense being—it is not only
the acceptance of *Vrīhi*, Rice and other grains that makes the occasion
unfit for study; but other things, also—be they ‘*animate*’—in the shape
of the cow and other animals—‘*or inaminate*’ in the shape of pairs of
cloth, etc,.—having accepted such a thing,—*i.e*., after having touched
it with his hand, at the time of acceptance—the man shall not study.
Because the act itself constitutes the act of ‘eating.’ ‘*Pāṇyāsya*’ is
one whose hand is his mouth. What this means is the eating at a
*śrāddha* and accepting gifts in connection with it—both stand on the
same footing.—(117)

It has been said above (verse 97) that, at the *Utsarjana* ceremony, one
night, along with the preceding and the following days, has deen
declared to be unfit for study; and with that the present text lays down
the option of observing ‘three days.’ But, in connection with the
‘Upākarma,’ this is the original Injunction.

‘*Aṣṭakās*’—*i. e*., the three or four eighth nights during the
fortnights following after the Full-Moon of the month of *Āgrahāyaṇa*.
Though it has been said above that the whole day and night is to be
observed on the eighth days of all fortnights, yet its mention in the
present connection is only right and proper, as emphasizing the
obligatory character of the rule; and, throughout the present context,
we have to regard two rules as optional only when each is found to be
self-sufficient.

‘*On the last nights of the seasons*;’—‘one day and night’ is to be
construed with this also. There are six seasons; and the *day* on which
one ends and the other begins, is to be regarded as unfit for study; and
the mention of ‘night’ is only by way of an indicative.—(119).

‘*Altercation*’—a quarrel, with mutual recrimination.

‘*Fight*’—in which the parties concerned strike each other with sticks
and such other weapons.

‘*Army*’—consisting of Elephants, Horses and Infantry.

‘*Battle*’—the actual affray.

Study is forbidden for one in the midst of an army, even though it be
not actually engaged in battle.

‘*When he has just eaten*;’—*i.e*, ‘so long as his hands are still
wet’—as mentioned in another Smṛti-text.

‘*Indigestion*;’—what has been eaten on the previous day, if it still
remains in the stomach, is called ‘undigested.’

‘*Vomiting*’—is well known.

‘*Eructation* even when there is no indigestion, if there is
‘eructation,’ that same day, or the next day.—(121).

The ‘*guest*’ here stands for gentlemen in general. The ‘guest’ is a
gentleman who happens to arrive by chance; and, when such a gentleman
has arrived, the Veda shall be studied, but only after his permission
has been obtained with the words, ‘May I proceed with my study.’ Says
another *Smṛti-text*,—‘When a gentleman has come to the house.’

When the winds blows ‘*vehemently*’—*i.e*., with great force.

*Objection*.—“Study has already been forbidden ‘when air is audible by
the ear’ (102), and so forth.”

True. But what is meant by the present text is that when the wind blows
with greater force than what has been mentioned before (in 102); or, it
may sefer to the wind blowing apart from the rains. That such is the
meaning is indicated by the usual meaning of the root ‘vā,’ ‘to blow,’
which means *to dry up*; and wind (apart from the rains) always tends to
dry up things; and in this sense, the term ‘*māruta*’ shall stand for
the constituent elements of’ the body; and the meaning in this case (of
the term ‘*vāti*’) shall be that—‘when the constituents of the man’s
body have been dried up by the labours of study’; the whole phrase
(‘*mārute vāti*’) would thus mean—‘when the wind is blowing high and the
reader is emaciated,’—there being no co-ordination between the two
locatives (in ‘*mārute*’ and ‘*vāti*’).

When blood has flowed, through the bite of leeches and such other
insects; or when blood has flowed, by reason of his body being wounded
by a weapon. The term, ‘from the body,’ is to be construed with both
clauses. (122).

It, has been declared that when Sāma-Veda is being chanted, the time is
unfit for the reciting of the Ṛgveda and the Yajurveda. Supplementary to
this, we have the present statement.

‘*Sacred to the pods*;’—*i.e*., that of which the gods are the presiding
genius; that is, which consists entirley of hymns to the gods. As a
matter of fact, hymns form the principal part of the Ṛgveda; it is for
this reason that it is called ‘*sacred to the gods*.’

As a matter of fact, action forms the predominating element in Men; and,
since the Yajurveda is made up principally of injunctions regarding
*Action*, the Yajurveda is, on account of this analogy, said to be
‘*human*.’ The term ‘*mānuṣa*’ denotes the genus ‘man;’ and, by a
process of identification, the Yajurveda has been called ‘*human*.’

‘*Related to the Pitṛs*’—may be taken to mean—either ‘beneficial to the
Pitṛs,’ or ‘of which the Pitṛs are the presiding genius;’ by some sort
of relationship, the Sāma-Veda has been called ‘related to the Pitṛs.’

There are three regions, and of these there, are three presiding beings;
the gods of Heaven, the Men of the Earth and the *Pitṛs* of the sky.
Similarly, there are three Vedas; and, since two of these have been
spoken of as related to ‘gods’ and ‘men,’ respectively, the third, Sāma
Veda, is, by a process of elimination, declared to be ‘*related to the
Pitṛs*.’

‘*Its sound is impure*’.—The sound of the Sāmaveda should not he
understood, by this, to be really impure; all that is meant is that,
just as Veda should not be recited in the presence of an impure
substance, so should it not he recited in the presence of the
Sāma-chant; it is on the ground of this similarity to ‘impure
substances’ that the sound of Sāma has been said to be ‘impure.’

From the context it is clear that this prohibition during Sāma-chant,
pertains to the reciting of the Ṛgveda and the Yajurveda in course of
the regular ‘Vedic study’ that, has been prescribed; and not to the
reciting of Mantra-texts that is done in the course of scrifical
performances.—(124)

‘*Knowing this*’,—*i*. *e*., the connection of the Vedas with the
presiding beings of the three Regions, as described in the preceding

reading in the cremation-ground.

What is laid down in the present text is to be regarded as an option to
what has been declared by Gautama—(l 26)

The twice-born man shall always carefully avoid only two conditions as unfit for study: viz. an unclean place of study and his own unclean condition.—(127)

The mention of ‘*always*’ here shows that the aforesaid occasions are to
be regarded as ‘unfit for study,’ only optionally; among these also
those that are obligatory have already been indicated; *e.g*., whenever
the term ‘always’ occurs; it has also been shown where what is stated is
purely descriptive; *e.g*., verse 114.

The place is regarded as ‘*unclean*’ when it is in contact with such
unclean things as bones, the generative organs, and so forth.

The conditions that make the man himself ‘unclean’ shall be described in
Discourse V.

Though the present conditions of ‘unfitness for study,’ are mentioned in
the context dealing with ‘Vedic Study,’ yet they are, in reality,
permanently ‘unfit for study;’ for the simple reason that the unclean
man is not entitled to any act; as says the Brāhmaṇa—‘For the sacrifice,
there are two conditions that make it *unjit*—when the man himself, or
the place, is unclean.’ The sacrifice here referred to is the
‘*Brahmayajña*,’ the daily reciting of Vedic mantras.—(127).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 193), which adds that this refers
to that ‘Vedic study’ which forms part of the daily ‘*Brahmayajña*’,
being based, as it is, on the following Taittirīya text: ‘*Tasya vā
etasya yajñasya dvāvanadhyāyau yadātmā*’ *śuciryoddeśaḥ*,’—which bears
specially upon the *Brahmayajña*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 775), which
says that this refers to that Vedic study which forms part of the daily
*Brahmayajña*;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 164), which has the same
note;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 196).

*Yājñavalkya* (1.149).—‘When the place or the man himself, is unclean,
when there is thunder and lightning, etc.’

*Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtra* (3.4.7).—‘Two occasions have been recognised as
unfit for study—*viz*., when the place is unclean and when the man
himself is unclean.’

*Pāraskara* (1.11.7-9).—‘On the death of the teacher, one shall enter
the water and desist from study for ten days—for three days, on the
death of a fellow-student;—for one day on the death of one who is not a
fellow-student.’

*Gobhila* (3.3.24.27).—‘On the death of a fellow-student,—on the death
of one’s own king,—on the death of the teacher, for three days; for a
day and night, on the death of the pupil.’
