Having heard the duties of the Student and the Householder as expounded
in the foregoing three Discourses, the great Sages, Marīci and others,
‘*said* to’—asked the following question of—Bhṛgu, their teacher.

“In the text we find the expression *of the Accomplished
Student*—‘*snātakasya*’; why then do you bring in the *Student*?”

Our answer to this is that the present verse is meant to be descriptive
of what has gone before; and as a matter of fact, the duties of the
Student also have been described.

‘*High-souled*’ and ‘*who sprang from the fire*’ are the epithets of
Bhṛgu;—‘He whose origination was from the fire.’

“But in discourse I, verse 34, Bhṛgu has been spoken of as the son of
Manu”.

True; but what was stated there was an imaginary commendation, while
what is said here is in accordance with the account found in the Vedas
of Bhṛgu having been born out of fire. The name ‘*Bhṛgu*’ has been thus
explained—‘What rose out first out of the fallen semen was the Sun, and
what rose as the second was Bhṛgu’. Or, what is asserted here may be
only figurative; the origin of Bhṛgu being described as ‘Fire’, on the
basis of similarity, as regards effulgence.

In any case, it is not necessary to lay stress upon either of the two
explanations as being the more reasonable of the two; because this is
not what forms the main subject-matter of the treatise.

The whole of the text, describing the question and the answer, is meant
to indicate the importance of the subject of the evils attaching to
food; the moaning being that the evils attaching to the food itself are
more serious than those attaching to the nature of its gift and
acceptance; and this on the ground that the defects attaching to the
thing itself are more intimate, and hence more serious, than those
arising from contact.

“In connection with the defects of contact, the Expiatory Rite that is
laid down is a three days’ fast; while that in connection with the thing
itself, is a single day’s fast (5. 20). How then can this latter be said
to be *more serious*?”

Our answer is as follows:—The greater seriousness here spoken of refers
to *garlic* and such things, in connection with which it is stated
that—‘by eating these intentionally the man becomes an outcast’ (5.19);
so that the expiation necessary would be that which has been prescribed
for outcasts (which is very serious).—(1)

The Text now shows what the great Sages asked.

‘*Thus*’—refers to the *manner* in which the Treatise has propounded the
subject; and ‘*exactly as described*’—refers to the *subject-matter* of
the Treatise.

Those Twice-born men who perform the duty exactly in the form in which
it has been described in the present Treatise:—that all *twice born men*
are indicated by the terms ‘*vipra*’ ‘*brahmana*’, in the Text will be
clear from what is going to be said in verse 26 below, where
‘twice-born’ is the term used;—‘*how is it that Death orerpotrers
them*’—while still in the state of the ‘Student,’ or in that of the^(;)
Accomplished Student’? How is this, when, in reality, they should live
the full spun of humun life? The span of a man’s life is a hundred
years; so that the death of Brāhmaṇas before that is not proper;
specially as it has been declared that ‘from right conduct one attains
longevity’ (4.156), and ‘no calamity befalls persons who recite the Veda
and. offer oblations’ (4.146). (2).

Bhṛgu, the righteous son of Manu, said to the great sages—“Listen, by what fault Death seeks to destroy the Brāhmaṇas.”—(3).


Death seeks to destroy the Brāhmaṇas on account of their omitting the study of the Vedas, on account of neglect of right conduct, on account of slothfulness and on account of the defects of food.—(4).

*Objection*—“When the question has been put forward in regard to
Brāhmaṇas *who perform their duties*, it is not right to answer it by
indicating the ‘fault’; nor can there be any connection with what
follows (in verse 4) \[as omission of Vedic Study &c. is not possible
for those who perform their duties\].”

The answer to the above is as follows:—‘Omission of Vedic Study’ and the
rest have been put forward only by way of illustration; the sense
being—‘just as the omission of Vedic Study and the rest are acknowledged
by you all to be the causes of death, so also are the defects of food,
going to be described below. Even when a man carries on Vedic Study &c.,
the fulfilment of his above-described duty is not complete, if it is
beset with the very much more serious drawback of defective food. This
is emphasised here in view of the fact that this is an entirely
different section (dealing with defects of food). (3-4)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The terms ‘*garlic*’ &c. are well-known among men.

The term ‘*karaka*’ is the name of a genus, sometimes regarded as the
same as the well-known thing ‘*kryāku*’ (?); mushrooms also are
‘*kavaka*’; as it is forbidden under the name of ‘*kavaka*’, while the
expiatory rite in connection with its eating has been prescribed under
the name of ‘*chatrāka*,’ in verse 19; and no other thing (except the
mushroom) is known by the name ‘*chatruka*’; nor will it be right to
regard, on the basis of verbal similarity alone (between ‘*chatrāka*’
and ‘*chatrākāra*’, umbrella-shaped), all those things as ‘*chatrāka*’
which *resemble the umbrella*, are ‘*chatrākāra*’; as in that case the
prohibition (of ‘*chatrāka*’) would apply also to the *suvarchala* and
other things (which also are *umbrella-shaped*); and this would be
contrary to all usage. Hence we conclude tha ‘*chatrāka*’ and ‘*kavaka*’
are one and the same thing. Says the author of the *Nirukta*—‘The
*chatrāka* is *kṣuṇṇa*, since it is smashed.’ From this it is clear that
the name ‘*kavaka*’ applies to those white shoots that grow out of the
earth that has been ploughed; this is also in keeping with what is going
to be said in connection with^(‘)*kavakas growing out of the earth*’
(6.14); and it has also been just pointed out that the name applies to
what is ‘smashed’ by a stroke of the foot. It is for this reason (of its
being described as *growing out of the earth*, and of its being *mashed*
by a stroke of the foot) that the prohibition (of ‘*kavaka*’) is not
applicable to those vegetable growths that shoot out of the trunks of
trees.

In medicinal treatises the *kukuṇḍa* has been described as ‘*kavaka*’;
but this explanation (of the name on a purely conventional basis) cannot
be accepted in the same manner as that in regard to the term ‘*go*’ and
the rest. Further, as a matter of fact, in ordinary *parlance* the term
‘*kavaka*’ is always applied to a *vegetable*. Hence it is on the basis
of usage that the exact signification of the term, wherever it occurs in
a medical or other scientific treatise, should be ascertained, and we
have already shown what that signification is.

Other things also, which resemble garlic and such things mentioned here,
which resemble these latter in colour and smell, have been forbidden by
Viṣṇu. In the *Smṛti* of Parāśara however the prohibition is by name,
and this for the purpose of prescribing the special Expiatory Rite of
‘*Candrāyaṇa*’ in connection with it. From this it follows that
‘*lavataka*’, ^(‘)*karnikāra*’ and such other things are forbidden.

‘*Things* *proceeding from* *impure substances*’;—those that grow of
impure things or are in contact with them.

Others have declared that it is not right to forbid those things that
grow only out of impure things, these standing on the same footing as
‘*mūlā*’ (radish) ‘*cāstuka*’ (a kind of grass) and such other things
(known to grow out of impure things);—so that the prohibition does not
apply to those grains and vegetables growing in fields specially manured
for the purpose of enriching the harvest.

This however is not right. Because from what the text says it is clear
that all these things are equally unfit to be eaten. Further, what has
been suggested might have been accepted, if it were absolutely
impossible for anything to grow without the use of impure substances.
There are some things however that grow directly out of impure
substances, while there are some that grow out of mere connection with
them; the right view to take therefore is that the prohibition applies
to the former only, and not to the latter.

As regards *meat*, even though it grows out of semen and blood (both
impure substances), yet the present prohibition does not apply to it;
because it has been dealt with in a totally different context.—(5)

‘*Exudation from trees*’;—anything, apart from the constituent parts of
the tree itself,—such as, the root, the trunk, the branches, the leaves,
the fruits and the flowers,—which proceeds from the tree, either in the
form of some liquid flowing from the cavity in the tree, or in some
other form. The epithet ‘red’ excludes, from prohibition, such
exudations as the camphor and the like.

Those that have their origin, source, in ‘*incisions*’; those that flow
from the bark and such parts of the tree. These things, if not red, are
not forbidden.

‘*Śelu*’—the *śleṣmātaka* fruit, to be known from medical and other
treatises. It should not be taken to mean the cream of fresh milk; as it
is never known to have that meaning. It has been argued that—“it is
better to take the word as standing for *cream*, on account of its
proximity to the term, ‘curdled milk’”. But *proximity* becomes a means
of deciding in favour of one of the two possible meanings of a term,
only when the term is actually found in usage to be used in both senses;
but it can never be the authority for attributing an unheard of meaning
to a word.

‘*Of the cow*’;—this shows that that of the buffalo etc. is not
forbidden. The milk is unfit to be eaten if, by mere contact with fire,
it becomes ‘*curdled*’,—*i.e*., thickened without adhesion; the term
‘*pīyūṣa*’ is used in the sense of the milk of the newly-calved cow.

“The text is going to declare, as *until to be eaten*, the milk, along
with all its preparations, of the cow for the first ten days of its
calving; and it is only during three or four days that the milk is of
the nature described above (*i.e*., curdled by mere contact with fire)
\[so that no separate prohibition appears to be called for.\]”

True; the thing is mentioned in the present verse with a view to those
cases where the milk continues to be so ‘curdled’ even after the first
ten days.

The two words—‘*carefully*’ and ‘*avoid?*—are added only for filling up
the metre; since ‘*unfit to be eaten*’ (of verse 5) continues to be
connected with all that is mentioned in the text.—(6)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 247);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.171),
which notes that the addition of the epithet ‘red’ makes it clear that
the prohibition does not apply to such exudations as assafœtida, camphor
and the like;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 711), which adds—‘the
red exudations’ meant are the *lac* and the rest,—the epithet ‘red’
indicating that such exudations as are white, *e.g*., assafœtida,
camphor and the like—are not forbidden,—‘*śelu*’ is
*śleṣmātaka*,—‘*peyūṣa*’ is ‘new milk,’ *i.e*., the milk of the
newly-delivered cow, whose blood-flow has not ceased; and in support it
quotes verse 8 following.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 510), which adds the
following notes—‘*Vṛkṣaniryāsa*’ is ‘the solidified exudation from
trees’,—‘*Vraścana*’ is cutting, and the exudations from cuttings are to
be avoided even when they are *not red*. The prohibition does not apply
to such things as assafœtida, camphor and the like,—‘*śelu*’ is
*śleṣmātaka*,—and ‘*peyūṣa*’ is the milk of the newly dilivered cow,
which solidifies at the slightest contact with fire;—in *Hemādri*

‘*Kṛsarasaṃyāran*’ is an aggregative copulative compound. Rice cooked
with Sesamum is called ‘*kṛsara*’;—‘*saṃyāva*’ is a particular article
of food, made up of butter, sugar, sesamum and such things, well-known
in cities.

Some people, on the strength of the root ‘*yu*’ (from which the term
‘*saṃyāva*’ is derived) signifying the act of *mixing*, explain the term
‘*saṃyāva*’ as standing for all those articles of food that are prepared
by-mixing together different kinds of grains,—such as the *mudga*, the
*kuṣṭhaka* and the rest.

For these persons the separate mention of ‘*kṛsara*’ would be
superfluous; as this would be included under ‘*saṃyāva*’, as just
explained.

The term ‘*needlessly cooked*’ is to be construed with all the terms. It
stands for what the householder cooks for himself, and not for the sake
of Gods, Pitṛs or guests.

This however does not appear to be right. Because the ordinary cooking
chat the Householder Hoes is not always for any such set purpose as that
of inn king offerings out of it. What happens is that the cooking having
been done, without reference to any particular purpose, and only in a
general way, the Five Sacrifices have been laid down, as to be offered
out of the food thus cooked. So that if the man eats the food without
having made the offering to the Viśvedevas out of it, he transgresses a
direct injunction; but no prohibition enters into the cuse. According to
the present text however, as just explained, such eating would
necessitate two expiatory rites,—one due to transgressing an injunction
(by not making the offering to the Viśvedevas), and another due to the
doing of a prohibited act (of cooking the Rice-sesamum needlessly). If
however such articles of food as ‘Rice-sesamum’ and the rest, are cooked
without reference to a particular God, or to a particular sacrificial
rite,—this involves a transgression of the rules pertaining to one’s
daily duties also.

As regards the text ‘one shall not cook for himself’,—this cannot be
regarded as a prohibition (; because it being absolutely necessary to Ho
the cooking, all that the sentence does is simply to make a reference to
the *act of eating* done by one who has disobeyed the rules (regarding
the daily ‘sacrifices’). For, as already pointed out above, if it were a
prohibition, there would be a twofold expiatory rite involved. Then
again, even when the cooking is done for some other purpose, it cannot
be absolutely denied that it has been done by the man ‘for himself’
also. ‘Cooking’ means the act of cooking food, and the fact of its being
done for one’s own self cannot be denied by means of the same word; as
the man is directed to live upon the same food (*i.e*., what is left
after the feeding of the guests &c). The eating of the remnant, of food,
after the guests and others have been fed, (which has been laid down for
the Householder) is not meant to be a mere ‘embellishment’ of the
Remnant (and not an act necessary for the maintenance of the man
himself). Nor has it been laid down anywhere that at the time of cooking
the Householder is to make use of any such formula of determination as
‘cook food *for me*’, which would be regarded as forbidden (by the
sentence ‘one shall not cook for himself’) In fact the cooking is said
to be ‘for himself’ only in consideration of what happens subsequently.
That is to say, if the food were cooked wjth the determination to make
an offering to the Gods, and then subsequently the man were to eat it
all himself, this would involve the wrong of being false to one’s own
resolve also. From all this it is clear that the sentence in question is
a mere reiterative reference, the sense being—‘what one cooks, he should
not use for himself until he has made the offering to the *Viśvedevas*’.

It is in view of all this that this same rule has been held to be
applicable also to the case of the man eating *uncooked* food; in
accordance with the assertion—‘the Gods of a man have the same food as
the man himselt’ (*Vālmīkīya Rāmāyaṇa*.)

Further, cooking is not to be done only by the hungry householder; in
fact, the act of cooking every day forms an integral factor of
*Householder ship* itself. So that even on the day on which the man
himself does not eat, if he omits the act of cooking, he incurs sin.

The upshot of the whole is this:—The man may cook for himself, or for
others; the words ‘shall not cook for himself’ can only mean that people
should not undertake the act, if they do not intend to make the offering
to the Viśvedevas. So that this only reiterates the obligatory character
of the offering. Similarly also the text that—‘For the removal of the
sin of the Five Slaughters, the Viśvedeva-offering shall be made in the
ordinary fire, in the Vedic sacrificial fire, in the fire in which
oblations have been already poured and the deity dismissed, in water or
on the ground, only reiterates the obligatory character of the offering
to the *Viśvedevas*. Because the said offering cannot be made into the
Vedic sacrificial fire; specially as there is no authority attaching to
a *Smṛti* text (as against a *Śruti* text) \[so that the text just
quoted cannot be taken in its literal sense\].

‘*Milk-rice and flour-cakes*’.—‘*Pāyasa*’, ‘*Milk-rice*,’ stands for
rice cooked in milk, and not for preparations of milk;—‘*Puroḍāśa* (?)’
is flour-cake.

‘*Food of the Gods*’:—what these are can only be ascertained from usage.

‘*Sacrificial viands*—the materials laid down in the *Śruti* as to be
offered into the Fire.

These are ‘unlit to be eaten only before the *Grahahomas*; as the text
is going to lay down the necessity of eating the remnants of the
offerings.

The meat of an animal that has not been ‘consecrated,’—*i.e*. which has
not been killed at a sacrifice.^(‘)Consecration’ is a peculiar form of
purification of the animal, prescribed in connection with the
‘Animal-Sacrifice.’ The mention of this indicates that one should eat
the remnant of the meat that has been offered at a sacrifice.

Though the Text has already used the qualification ‘*needlessly
prepared*’, yet the epithet ‘*unconsecrated*’ has been added with a view
to forbid the merit of the cow, the sheep and the goa (goat?) that may
have been left by the guest and other persons to whom they may have been
offered. Or, the term *unconsecrated* may be taken as refering specially
to the meat of the cow, the sheep and the goat; since it is the killing
of these animals only that has been enjoined in connection with
sacrifices; the other animals being described as already ‘*prokṣita*’,
‘washed clean’ (fit for cating).

If we read the opening words as ‘*anirdaśāham goḥ kṣīram*,’ then the
prohibition regarding the milk of the camel and other animals also would
be understood as limited to the ten days from calving; so that the
qualification ‘that has not passed its ten days’ being taken with every
one of the animals, it would become necessary to depend entirely upon
usage in support of the absolute prohibition of the milk of the camel
and other animals. If however we rend ‘*anirdaśāyāḥ*’ in the feminine
form, then there would be no possibility of the above misunderstanding.
Because it would not be possible to interpret the nominal affixes
(attached to filenames of the other animals) as, in any way, connecting
these animals with the epithet ‘*anirdaśāyāḥ*’)

In as much as the word ‘milk’ is repeated in the second half of the
verse, this implies that what are forbidden by the former half are the
milk of the camel, of the one-hoofed animals, of the sheep, of the goat
and of the cow within ten days of its calving,—along with all its
preparations; while in the case of the ‘irregular’ cow and the cow
‘deprived of its calf’, it is the *milk* only that is forbidden. Such is
the usage also.

That cow is called ‘*anirdaśāha*,’ ‘not passed its ten days’, in whose
case ten days have not passed since her calving.

‘*Irregular cow*’;—the cow that is expected to give milk both morning
and evening, but gives it only at one time; giving milk in the evening
only if not milked in the morning; and on account of the supply of milk
being scanty, she is milked once only.

Some people explain ‘*Sandhini*’ as standing for that cow which, on
having lost her own calf, is made to yield milk by bringing to her the
calf of another cow; and in this case the cow ‘*without her calf*’ would
be one whose calf is alive, but is separated from it, and is milked,
independently of the calf, through presenting before her such special
articles of food as the husks of barley, rice etc., so that the cow
would be called ‘without her calf’ by the calf being held aside; just as
people say—‘bring the cow without her calf’.

The ‘cow’ having been already mentioned in the first half, the term is
repeated in the second half, with a view to show that similar milk of
the goat and the buffalo is not forbidden. The same does not hold good
regarding the epithet ‘*anirdaśāyāh*,’ ‘that has not passed its ten
days;’ so that in this connection the ‘cow’ includes the front and the
buffalo also. So says Gautama (17.22-23)—‘The milk of the cow that has
not passed its ten days, during the period of impurity; also of the goat
and the buffalo.’

The term ‘*payaḥ*’ ‘milk,’ has been added because it is not easy to
construe the term ‘of the cow,’ with the term ‘*kṣīram*,’ ‘milk’ as
contained in the compound ‘*sandhinīkṣīram*.’—(8)

‘*Sandhinī*’—‘a cow that gives milk only once a day’ (Medhātithi, and
Govindarāja);—‘a cow in heat’ (Kullūka, who quotes Hārita in support,
Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘a cow big with calf’ (Nandana);—‘a cow
whose own calf being dead, is milked with the help of another’s calf’
(‘some one’ mentioned in Medhātithi.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290), where it is said that
the unintentional drinking of these milks, if done once only, makes one
liable to the penance of a single day’s fast, while if done
intentionally, or if repeated, it entails a three days’ fast.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 712), where the
‘*Sandhinī*’ is described as ‘the cow that approaches the bull *i.e*.,
the cow in heat’,—and the ‘*anirdaśā*’ as ‘the one that has not passed
more than ten days since delivery.’

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 448), which adds the
following:—‘*anirdaśā*’ is that which has not passed ten days since its
delivery;—the ‘cow’ stands for the goat and the buffallo
also;—‘*ekaśapha*’ are the horse and other one-hoofed animals;—the
‘*sandhinī*’ is the cow that seeks for the bull; the avoiding of the
second ‘*goḥ*’ in the second line indicates that it is the milk of the
*cow* only that has lost its calf, and not that of the goat or the
buffalo.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 525), which adds the
following:—‘*nirdaśā*’ is the cow that has passed ten days since
delivery;—‘*ekaśapha*’ are the horse and other one-hoofed
animals—‘*āvika*’ is ‘the milk of the ewe’;—‘*sandhinī*’ is the cow in
heat;—‘*vivatsā*’ is one devoid of her calf.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 929), which contains the same
remarks as *Mitākṣarā*;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha p. 13a)—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 567);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 328), which explains
‘*ekaśapha*’ as standing for the Horse and the like, and ‘*Sandhinī*’ as
the cow ‘which has been covered by the bull’;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 335).

*Gautama* (17.22-26).—‘The milk of the cow until ten days have elapsed
since its calving, which is its period of impurity;—also of the she-goat
and the she-buffalo;—the milk of sheep and of the camel is never to be
drunk, as also that of one-hoofed animals; also the milk of the cow that
is constantly dripping milk, or which gives birth to twins or of the
irregular cow; also of the cow that has lost its calf.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.12.9-11).—‘The milk of an animal until its calf is ten
days old, and of one that gives milk while pregnant should not be
drunk;—nor that of a cow which has no calf, or which is milked with a
strange calf; the milk of sheep, camels or one-hoofed animals.’

*Āpastamba* (1.17.22-24).—‘The milk of sheep,—also the milk of the
camel, the deer, the milk of the irregular cow and of the cow that gives
birth to twins,—also of the cow within ten days of its calving.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.34-85).—‘Let him not drink the milk of the cow in heat,
nor of one whose calf has died;—nor that given by cows, buffalos and
goats within ten days of calving.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.28-40).—‘All milks, except that of the cow, the goat and the
buffalo;—the milk of even these within ten days of calving;—also the
milk of those which are irregular in milk, or which constantly drip
milk, or which has lost its calf.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.170).—‘Milk of the cow in heat, of the cow within ten
days of its calving, of the cow that has lost its calf,—one should
avoid; also the milk of camels, of one-hoofed animals, of women, of wild
animals and of sheep.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 216).—‘The milk of all animals with two teats
should be avoided, except that of the goat.’

*Āpastamba* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 712).—‘The well-behaved Kṣatriya, or
Vaiśya or Śūdra should not drink the milk of the Kapilā cow.’

*Hārīta* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, pp. 525, 526).—‘One shall not drink the
milk of the cow in heat;—nor of the cow whose calf is absent or dead, of
the cow that has been milked dry, nor of one just calved, till seven
days have elapsed, according to some,—ten days, according to
others,—while according to some, milk becomes drinkable after a
month;—they say that for two months, all the milk should he given to the
calf; during the third month, one shall milk only two teats, during the
fourth three teats.’

‘*Wild animals*’—cows, elephants, monkeys and so forth.

There can be no milk of males; hence the masculine gender used in
connection with the words ‘*sarvī(?)ṣām mṛgāṇam*’ is to be taken as
standing for the genus, and the connection is with the female members of
that genus: the term ‘*mṛgakṣīram*’ thus being similar
to^(‘)*kukkuṭāṇḍam*’. This has been made clear by the author of the
*Mahābhāṣyu* in connection with the rules relating to the change of the
feminine form into the masculine, (when occurring within a compound).

‘*Māhiṣam vinā*’;—the neuter form has been used, in view of the neuter
form ‘*payaḥ*’^(‘)milk’.

‘*Females*,’—hum in females, women. Though in such passages as^(‘)*strī
gauḥ somakrayiṇī*’,^(‘)the female cow is the price of the *soma*’,—the
term ‘*strī*’, ‘female’, is found to be used in connection with the
*animal with the dew(?)lap* also,—yet it is to be understood here in the
sense of the^(‘)woman’, in as much as in the present context the term
cannot apply to any other species of animals, and as it is better known
as standing for the^(‘)human female’ only. In all such assertions
as—‘females desire sweets’, ‘females are the best jewels’—the word is
understood as standing for the *woman*.

The term^(‘)*eva*’ in the text has been explained as indicating the
prohibition of applying the woman’s milk to the eye and such other uses
of it: the it caning being that the milk of the woman is to be avoided,
not only in eating, but also in all similar uses. The word can be taken
as indicative of all this only on the strength of usage and other
*Smṛti* texts; and it cannot be regarded as directly expressive of
it.—(9).

All ‘soured substances’ having been forbidden in the foregoing verse,
the present: text makes an exception in favour of a few of them.

‘*Śukta*’, ‘soured substance’, is the name of those substances which,
being juicy in their constitution and having a distinct taste of their
own, become *soured* either by the flux of time, or by the contact of
some other substance. For instance, the *Āmrātaka*, which is sweet and
full of juice, becomes^(‘)soured’ after the lapse of some time;
cane-juice becomes ‘soured’ after sometime. Things that are sour by
their very nature—*e*. *g*., the Pomegranate, the Āmalaka, the Lemon
&c.—are not called^(‘)soured substances’; nor those that are still
*unripe*. Because the term^(‘)*śukta*’,^(‘)soured’, is not synonymous
with^(‘)sour’. What are directly forbidden here are only those soured
substances that have become sour by fermentation; and those that turn
sour by the contact of flowers and roots &c. are only indirectly
indicated; according to what Gautama has said (17.14)—^(‘)All soured
substances except Curd only’.

^(‘)*Distilled*’.—Distillation consists in allowing the thing to remain
soaked in water over-night.

“In that case the sourness would be due to the length of time (so that
all these would be included among^(‘)Soured Substances’).”

True; these also are ‘soured substances’; and the Instrumental ending
may signify either *instrumentality* or *association*. The meaning thus
is—‘what are *distilled*—*e.g*. made out of—flowers etc. along with
water’.

Some people offer the fallowing explanation:—“The roots of trees are
directly productive of *sourness*. Such ‘sour substances’ as the
Pomegranate, the *Āmalaka* and the rest are ‘fit to be eaten’, while
those that are distilled from grapes and other sweet things are not
eaten. ‘Distillation’ means *producing acidity*; hence ‘*distilled from
flowers*’ means soured by flowers and such things. Grapes and such other
things however are not themselves productive of acidity; in their case
it is *time* alone that is the acidulating agent.”

This however i not right; simply because such is not the meaning of the
term (‘distillation’). When one says ‘he is *distilling* Soma’—this is
not understood to mean that he is *making it sour*; what is understood
is as we have explained above.

‘*Prepared out of curd*’;—*e.g. Udaśvit*, *Maṣṭu* (whey), *Kilāṭa*
(Coagulated milk), *Kūrcika* (Inspissated milk) and so forth.—(10)

‘*Carnivorous*’;—those that eat raw flesh; such as the Heron, the
Vulture &c. What are meant are those that eat *raw flesh* only; and not
those that eat both (raw and cooked flesh), such as the Peacock and the
rest.

‘*Living in villages*’—even though they be not carnivorous.

‘*One-hoofed animals*;’—*e.g*., the Horse, the Mule, the Ass and so
forth.

‘*Not specified*’;—*i.e*. those that have not been specified as *fit to
be eaten* should not be eaten: those that have been so specified are lit
to be eaten. For instance, it has been declared that ‘one who desires to
obtain offspring shall eat the meat of the camel, the horse, the bear
and the white ass’. \[and here the one-hoofed animals, horse and white
ass, are specified as fit to be eaten\].

“The eatability of these animals is known only from this *Śruti*
passage. And the presence of the term ‘specified’ in the verse would he
understood to mean that the animals thus specified in the Vedic passage
may be eaten even elsewhere (apart from Vedic sacrifices also); the
meaning of the text being ‘one shall avoid those *nut specified*, but
not *those specified*.’ As a matter of fact however, nowhere in the
*Smṛti* have any one-hoofed animals been *specified* as fit to be eaten,
with reference to which the term ‘not specified’ (of the text) could be
explained. Hence it comes to this that ‘those not specified *in the
śruti* are unfit to be eaten”.’

Our answer to the above is that such a sense of the Smṛti would be
contrary to all usage. The term ‘not specified’ is a mere re-iterative
reference.

‘*Ṭiṭṭibha*’—is a bird which is always screaming ‘ṭiṭ’, ‘ṭiṭ’. In most
cases the names of birds are in imitation of their sounds: as says the
*Nirukta*—‘The name *Kāka* is in imitation of the sound; such is the
case with most bird-names.’—(11).

construed with both ‘*kravyādaḥ*’ and ‘*grāmanivāsinaḥ*’;—*ekaśapha*’
are the horse and other one-hoofed animals,—‘*anirdiṣṭaḥ*’ means ‘those
that are not mentioned in the *Śruti* as fit for eating’; those that are
mentioned as such should certainly be eaten; this refers to such
sacrificial animals as are mentioned in the Vedic texts like the
following:—‘One should sacrifice the horse to Tvaṣṭṛ’; which implies
that the flesh of the horse so sacrificed must be eaten;—‘*Ṭiṭṭibha*’ is
the name of the bird that makes the ‘*ṭī ṭī*’ sound.

‘*Sparrow*’, ‘*Kalabiṅka*’ (‘*Kalaviṅka*’), is the name of a
village-bird described in the scriptures. Its prohibition being already
got at by the general prohibition of all ‘village-birds’, the separate
mention of the sparrow implies the catability of the *female*
sparrow;—the term ‘*kalabiṅka*’ being a masculine just like the term
‘bull.’

Others have explained that this name has been added for the purpose of
excluding (from the prohibition) the *wild* sparrow, which retires to
the forest during the rains. They are called ‘village-birds’ because of
their living in the villages during the greater part of the year; just
as is the case with the ‘wild buffalo.’

The prohibition of the *plava*, the *haṃsa*, and the *cakravāka* being
already got at from the general prohibition of all ‘web-footed birds’,
the separate mention of these is for the purpose of emphasising the
obligatory character of their exclusion.—the eating of the ‘*Ātya*’ and
other ‘web-footed’ birds being regarded as *optional*.

‘*Village-cock*’—the specification of the ‘*village* -cock’ permits the
eating of the wild cock.

“But why should there have been any suspicion regarding the
non-eatability of the *wild* cock at all?”

Because another *Smṛti* text says simply—‘Among birds, *the cock*’,
which indicates that all kinds of cock are equally ‘unfit to be eaten’;
it is for this reason that this general statement line been sought by
the present text, to be limited in its scope.

“But why cannot this he regarded as a case of option, since the present
text permits the eating of the wild crick, which the other text
forbids?”

This cannot he a case of option: it is a case of option only when there
are two contradictory texts of equal authority hearing upon the same
subject; in the present case however, there is no contradiction: there
is no difference in the actual teaching of the two *Smṛti-texts*
concerned: because it is quite reasonable to regard the general
statement as restricted in its scope; specially as a third independent
text has already been quoted above.

“If this be so, then the general prohibition regarding the web-footed
birds may be taken as restricted in its scope to the *Haṃsa* and other
specified birds: so that the prohibition does not extend to all crows
and web-footed birds.”

This would have been the case if the Smṛti-treatises were not the work
of a human author. In the case of works of non-human origin, if they
proceed from different sources, there would be no useful purpose by
making the general statement restricted to the particular case of the
*Haṃsa* and other birds; while in the case of the work of human authors,
if they proceed from different persons, it is quite possible that the
person who knows the truth in its general form is ignorant of it in the
restricted form, or the person who know it in the limited form is
ignorant of it in the wider form; so that when we come to consider the
source of the two statements, we assume the existence (in the Veda) of a
general statement as the source of one, and a particular statement as
the source of the other: and these two Vedic statements occurring in two
different recensional texts, the only reasonable course is to construe
them together, unless there are distinct injunctions bearing upon the
two statements. Specially as no such complaint can be raised against the
Vedas as—‘What is the use of the *general* statement if it is to be
taken in its restricted sense?’ There is no room for such a complaint,
because there is no author in the case against whom such a complaint
could be raised. Specially as in the case of a Vedic statement, the only
idea that is obtained is front the actual words of the text, only that
which can be derived from the words themselves; and there can be no
justification for the assuming of any other meaning, for any purpose
whatsoever.

What the ‘*Rajjudāla*’ and other birds are is to be learnt from persons
versed in the science of birds.—(12)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 540), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kalaviṅka*’ is the *caṭaka*, the sparrow; these being
already included under ‘*grāmanivāsinaḥ*’, their separate mention is
meant to indicate that they are *always* to be avoided; which implies
that the ‘*cāṣa*’ and other ‘*grāmanivāsi*’ birds *may be* eaten. \[All
this hitter note is attributed to Medhātithi by the writer; but no words
to this effect are found in Medhātithi; see *Translation* \].—The
epithet ‘*grāma*’ in ‘*grāmakukkuṭaḥ*’ indicates that *wild kukkuṭa* is
not forbidden; ‘*sārasa*’ in the bird called ‘*puṣkara*,’ which has a
long neck, long feet and is of blue colour;—‘*Rajjudāla*’ is the
*wood-pecker*;—‘*dātyūha*’ the *black-necked* bird;—‘*Śuka*’ is

Those that feed by ‘striking’—piercing—^(‘)with their beaks.’ Such is
the nature of these birds. The *Śatapatra* and other birds belong to
this class.

‘Web-footed’—The *Āti* and the rest. That there is an option in regard
to this has already been pointed out above (*Bhāṣya* on 12.)

“Wherever there is an *option*, it depends upon the man’s wish which of
the two options he will adopt: and as a matter of fact, it is only an
unforbidden course that can be so adopted. The act of *eating* is an
ordinary temporal act, possible only when there is a desire on the part
of the man (to do it); it is not a spiritual act, which would have to be
done in any case. So that we do not see any useful purpose that could be
secured by an optional prohibition.”

Our answer to this is that this has already been answered.

“But what has been said may be all right in regard to cases where (as in
the Veda) the comprehension of the meaning depends entirely upon the
words of the text, and there is no intention (of any author) behind them
(to indicate their true purport). The present treatise however is the
work of a human author, having been composed by him with great care and
labour. for the purpose of supplying in brief all the information that
was contained in another voluminous work containing a hundred thousand
verses; so that no needless word can be used in it. In fact it is for
this reason (of his not using a single superfluous word) that the author
comes to be regarded as a ‘Teacher’. It is not that there is no
prohibition of *all web-footed birds* in general, in which case alone
the prohibition of a particular web-footed bird, the *Haṃsa*, could be
justified. Since the present verse also is a Smṛti-text (and it forbids
all web-footed birds in general). Some people have held that the term
‘*jālapāda*’ (web-footed bird) in the present verse is a wrong reading”.

We have already explained that the intention of the Teacher is undersood
with the help of gestures, actions and the spinning out of long
explanations; and in the present case particular details are also
inferred. What was meant to be said was that ‘one shall not eat
web-footed birds in normal times’; but the author has propounded the
prohibition in the wider form, with it view to justifying both
prohibitions (of *web-footed* birds in general, and of the *Haṃsa* in
particular).

‘*Sūnā*’ ‘Slaughter house’, is that place where animals are killed for
the purpose of selling their flesh. Others explain it as ‘meat-market’.

‘*Dried meat*’, ‘*Vallura*’, is Mesh dried and kept for several days.

‘*Nakhuviṣkira*’ are those birds that scratch with their nails;—*e.g*.
the Peacock, the Cock &c.

These birds are partly ‘fit to be eaten’ also, in view of the assertion
that these may be eaten ‘in abnormal times;’ specially in view of what
another Smṛti-writer has said regarding ‘the Cock among birds’ (being
eatable). But the present text of Manu cannot be regarded as referring
to the Cock; as in that case the separate mention of the ‘Cock’ would be
useless.—(13)

separately in order to indicate that the eating of the other fish-eating
birds is optional.

‘*Fish-eaters*’.—Animals other than birds also, which eat fish, are to
be regarded as ‘unfit to be eaten’; such animals, for instance, as the
alligator and the like; that this is what is meant, is clear from the
fact that the name ‘*fish-eater*’ is to be applied in its literal sense.

*Kākola* is the same as the Kite, such being its name in foreign lands;
for instance, it is known by this name in the *Bāhlīka* country.

The prohibition of the ‘*village-pig*’ implies the permission to eat the
wild pig. The prohibition of those ‘living in villages’ in the preceding
verse (11) should be taken, on the strength of the context, us referring
to *birds* only. It is only thus that there would be any point in the
mention of the ‘village-pig’ in the present verse. The pig that lives in
villages is called ‘*viḍvarāha*’, ‘*village-pig*.’

“If in verse 11, ‘those living in villages’ are to be taken, on the
strength of the context, as *birds* only, then the term ‘fish-eaters’ in
the present verse also should be taken as referring to *birds* only.”

Not so; because the present context is not restricted to *birds* only;
since it mentions also non-birds, such as the ‘village pig’ and‘fish.’

‘*Sarvaśaḥ*,’— always.

This is a general rule; its exceptions we shall explain later on.—(14).

This is a commendatory supplement to the foregoing prohibition of fish.

When one eats the flesh of an animal, he comes to be described as
connected with the act of eating that animal; *e.g*., the mungoose is
called ‘serpent-eater’, the cat ‘rat-eater’ and so forth. He who eats
fish eats all kinds of flesh; it would be right to speak of him as a
‘beef-eater’ also.

Hence, by reason of the possibility of this calumny, one should avoid
fish.—(15).

‘*Pāṭhīna*’ and ‘*Rohita*’—two particulars kinds of fish-having been
mentioned as fit to be offered to Gods and to Pitṛs, the eating of these
is permitted on the occasion of the performance of *Śrāddha* and other
rites; and not in the course of ordinary daily food. As for the
*Rājīva*, the ‘*Siṃhatuṇḍa*’ and the ‘*Saśalka*’ fish on the other hand,
these are to be eaten ‘*on all occasions*’; *i.e*. they may be eaten
also on occasions other than the offerings to Gods and to Pitṛs.

‘*Rājīva*’ some people regard this as standing for lotus-coloured fish.
Others explain it as standing for those fish that are marked by lines.

‘*Siṃhatuṇḍa*,’—those having a lion-like face.

‘*Saśalka*’—is the same as the fish called ‘*Shakalin*.’—(16).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

Medhātithi and Govindarāja explain the meaning to be that “The Pāṭhīna
and the Rohita are to be eaten only when offered to the gods or Pitṛs,
and not ordinarily, while those enumerated in the second half are to be
eaten ‘*sarvasaḥ*’ at all times.”—Kullūka objects to this explanation on
the following grounds:—There is no authority for the view that the two
kinds of fish are to be offered at Śrāddhas, eaten only by the person
invited at it, not by the performer of the Śrāddha or other persons,
while the other kinds are to be eaten by others also;—in fact all other
authorities have placed all those mentioned here on the same footing.
Kullūka’s own explanation is as follows:—‘The *Pāṭhīna* and the *Rohita*
should be eaten, *as also* the *Rājīva* and the rest’;—and the phrase
‘*niyuktau havyakavyoḥ*’ he takes as standing by itself, in the sense
that ‘all things that are forbidden may be eaten, when one is threatened
with starvation, after they have been offered to the gods and Pitṛs.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.178), which goes one farther
than Medhātithi, and adds that those enumerated in the second line also
are to be eaten only when offered at Śrāddhas and sacrifices;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 547), which adds the following
notes:—‘*ādyau*’ means ‘are to be eaten’—when they are
‘*niyuktau*’—*i.e*., used for the purpose of *Śrāddha* and other
offerings;—‘*Pāṭhīna*’ is that which is also called ‘*Chandraka*,’
‘*Rājīva*’ is red-coloured, ‘*Siṃhatuṇḍa*,’ is that which has its mouth
like the lion’s, ‘*Saśalka*’ are fish covered with shell-like skin.

It is quoted in *Smṛtattva* (p. 449);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
577);—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 300), which explains ‘*niyuktau*,’ as
employed for Śrāddha and other purposes, and ‘*ādyau*’ as ‘may be
eaten,’ ‘*rājīva*’ as red-coloured.

Among five-nailed animals, the Porcupine and the rest are fit to be
eaten.

In another *Smṛti*, there is option regarding the Rhinoceros. Says
Vaśiṣṭha (14-4?)—‘They dispute about the rhinoceros.’

With the exception of the camel, all those animals are fit to be eaten
which have only one line of teeth: for instance, the cow, the gout and
the deer.

“In as much as the present verse specifies the porcupine &c. as alone
fit to be eaten, among five-nailed animals,—it follows that all the
other five-nailed animals are unfit to be eaten; so that the prohibition
of ‘all five-nailed animals’ becomes entirely superfluous.”

There is nothing wrong in this. When the prohibition is stated in so
many words, our comprehension of it is *direct*; if on the other hand,
we were to derive our knowledge of what should not be eaten from the
specification of what should be eaten, our comprehension of the
prohibition would be only inferential, indirect; and this would he a
complicated process.—(18).

for wine-drinking.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.176), which says that this refers to
intentional and repeated eating of the things; also on 3.229;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 317), as referring to intentional

intentional eating of forbidden things is equal to wine-drinking; and

‘*Unintentionally*’—unwillingly,—^(‘)*having eaten these*’—any one of
the six just mentioned that it is any *one* that is meant, and not *all
together*, is indicated by the fact that the act of eating in this case
is nor. what is actually *enjoined*.

^(‘)*In* *the case* *of* *the rest*’—*i.e*. in the case of eating the
other things—‘red exudations from trees’ and other things forbidden
above,—one should desist from eating ‘*for a day*’;—the term^(‘)day’ is
used as including the *night* also; *e.g*. in such passages as^(‘)the
day is dark, the day is bright’ —(*Ṛgveda* 6.9.1.)

In connection with the eating of some of the things here forbidden, the
text is going to prescribe in the section on Expiatory

Rites (Discourse 11) distinct expiatory rites:—*e.g*., in connection
with^(‘)carnivorous animals, pig etc.’ (11.156); and in this case those
are the Rites to be performed; since they have been directly enjoined in
so man words; specially as the single ‘day’s fast’ here prescribed will
have its application only in cases other than those especially provided

down the expiation for the *unintentional* eating of the things;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 317) to the same effect, with the
additional note that the ‘Sāntapana’ meant here must he that which
extends over seven days.—The last quarter is quoted twice in *Mitākṣarā*
on 3.290, to the effect that if one eats forbidden things other than
those here mentioned only *once*, and that *unintentionally*, he has got
only to fast for the day;—under 1.175 to the effect that the eating of
the forbidden birds unintentionally makes one liable to fasting for the
day;—and the first three quarters on 1.176, where it is pointed out that
it refers to *unintentional* and *repeated* eating of the things;—also
on 3.229 as laying down the expiation for unintentional eating.

It is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1157), to the effect that by
unintentionally eating the things enumerated repeatedly one becomes

fasting during the day.

This refers to the Brāhmaṇa who is in the habit of eating at the house
of those *Śūdra* whose food he is permitted to eat.

It is possible that at the house of a *Śūdra*, there may he some
articles of food that are not fit to be eaten by the Brāhmaṇa, which can
not always be avoided; if the Brāhmaṇa eats at the house of such a
*Śūdra*, there is always a fear of his having partaken of some forbidden
food; hence for him it is laid down that he should perforin the
‘*Prājāpatya Kṛcchra*’. In all bases where the precise form of the
‘*kṛcchra*’ is not laid down, it should be understood to be
the^(‘)Prājāpatya’ *kṛcchra* as we shall explain later on.

^(‘)*In order to* *atone* *for unintentional eating*’:—*i.e*., in the
event of there being suspicion of his having unwillingly partaken of
forbidden food; that is, for the expiating of the sin incurred, in the
event of his having eaten forbidden food.

“But the expiation for this is going to be prescribed later on, under
5.I27.”

What that means and refers to we shall explain in connection with that
verse.

For the art committed intentionally, special rites should be performed;

In connection with food fit to be eaten, the Text proceeds to sanction
the act of killing.

If one’s dependents are very much pressed by hunger, and no other food
can be found, then one may kill such birds and beasts as are fit to be
eaten. The exact meaning of the term ‘dependent’ has been explained
before (as standing for parents, wife etc.)

The mention of Agastya—that Agastya did the act—is only by way of
recommendation.

The first half of the verse is purely commendatory; because the act of
killing in connection with sarcifices is directly enjoined by the Vedic
injunctions themselves (and as such does not stand in need of any
sanction from the present text).

‘*Commanded*’—*i.e*., permitted as lit to be eaten.

This same thing is slated in the next verse in greater detail, as
bearing upon the recommendation of certain acts.—(22).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.179) to the effect that just
as there is nothing wrong in the eating of meat which is the remnant of
sacrificial and Śrāddha offerings, so also there is none in eating that

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 537), which adds that
animals are to he killed for feeding one’s dependents, only when there
is no other means of feeding them; and this implies also that there is
no harm in one’s eating the meat himself that is left after the feeding
of dependents;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 301).

The killing of beasts and birds has been prescribed in connection with
the sacrifice named ‘*Ṣaḍviṃśat-saṃvatsara*’ (Twenty-six Years). This is
what is referred to in the present verse. The Brāhmaṇa-passage bearing
upon the subject is as follows:—‘At the end of the day the master of the
house goes out hunting, and out of the flesh of the animals that he
kills sacrificial cakes are made’.

In as much as the present verse is purely commendatory, no significance
is meant to be attached to the past tense in the term ‘*babhūva*’,
‘*were made*’; hence the same thing is done now-a-days also.

The same holds good regarding the term ‘*purāṇeṣu*’, ‘*in ancient
times*’. This also means that people should not consider that the said
sacrificial practice has come into force in recent times only.—Or, the
term may be taken to mean that ‘it should not be understood that there
is nothing to sanction the practice of killing animals at
sacrifices’.—Or, the term may be regarded as added for the benefit of
those persons who are incapable of comprehending the meaning of the
scriptures themselves, and who regulate their conduct entirely in
accordance with the practices of other people, on the principle that
‘the right path is that whereby great men have gone’. The meaning is
that ‘this practice is not of recent origin, it is without beginning’.

The ‘ancient sages’ are certain Brāhmaṇas, well-known for their
austerities. Or, it may stand for a distinct species of beings; as
described in the Mahābhārata and other works. In this connection it is
not necessary to press the objection that—“If these sages belong to a
distinct species of beings, they are like *Gandhar* *vas* and others,
and as such, not entitled to the performance of sacrifices.”;—since the
passage is a purely commendatory one, and as such, may be understood in
any way one chooses.

‘*Brahmakṣatriyasava*’,—*sacrifices* performed by Brāhmaṇas and
Kṣatriyas.—(23)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 537) quotes this verse as *Arthavāda* to the
preceding verse, the meaning being as follows:—‘Inasmuch as in ancient
sacrifices performed by sages, edible sacrificial cakes used to be made
of animals and birds killed for the purpose, these may be killed by men
of the present day also.’ That the sacrificial cake is to be made of the
flesh of animals has been laid down in connection with the
‘Thirty-six-year Sacrificial Session’, about which we read that “on the
closing day of which, the master of the house goes out a—hunting, and
out of the flesh of the animals killed there the *Savanīya* sacrificial
cakes are prepared.”

‘*Whatever food is mixed with oils*.’—‘*Food*’ stands for Rice etc.
Though the roots to ‘eat’ and to ‘feed’ are synonymous, yet the two
terms ‘food’ and ‘eatables’ have been used with a view to the various
articles of food.

‘*Unspoilt*’—here stands for what has not become sour by keeping.

Such food ‘*may b* *e* *eaten*, *though stale*’. That is called ‘stale’
which has been kept over night. What is cooked on one day also becomes
‘stale’ the next day.

‘*Mixed with oils*.’—In regard to this the following question is
raised:—

“Does this mean that whatever in the shape of vegetable-juice etc. has
been cooked with oils should be eaten even when stale?—Or, that oils are
to be mixed up with dry articles of food, at the time that they are
going to be eaten stale? According to the latter view stale cakes and
sweets also would have to be eaten only after having been *mixed with
oils*.”

There is, it is argued, no room for any such doubt; since what is
asserted by the words ‘may be eaten though stale’ is only the eatability
of food mixed with oils; so that the epithet ‘mixed with oils’ is part
of the Subject, and not of the Predicate. Nor do we find it referred to
by the pronoun ‘*tat*’, ‘that’, by any such form of expression as ‘what
is stale, *that* may be eaten mixed with oils’ (which would make the
epithet part of the Predicate).

The answer to this is that there is still some ground for doubt; as
(according to the explanation just suggested) there would be no point in
the separate mention of the ‘remnants of sacrificial offering’, which
are stale and *not mixed* *with* *oils* (the latter being implied by
their being mentioned apart from ‘food mixed with oils;’ because there
is no chance of these remnants being ‘mixed with oils’ and becoming
‘stale’. Consequently the separate mention of these can have some sense
only if in their case it were not considered necessary to mix oils at
the time of eating. So that the separate mention of these becomes
justified only if, in the case of these Remnants, it be not necessary to
mix oils at the time of eating (*which is considered necessary in the*
*case* *of the other articles of food*.)

But, even so, there need not be any doubt. For in that case, it would be
only right to take the epithet ‘mixed with oils’ as part of the
Predicate, for the purpose of justifying the separate mention of the
‘Remnants of sacrificial offerings’. \[So that thus also, the meaning
would be quite clear, though different from what we had explained
before.\]

In answer to this it is argued that there is only this ground for doubt
that in view of the fact that the direct construction of the words as
they stand is always to be preferred to any other roundabout
constructions,—would it be right to regard the mention of the
‘sacrificial remnants’ as merely reiterative (and not injunctive) \[ in
which case it may well be left pointless\]? Or that, inorder to guard
against the mention being pointless, the words should be construed to
mean that whatever is stale should be mixed with oils at the time of
eating?

On this point there is no doubt; rather than allow the words of the text
to be regarded us pointless, it is far more reasonable to have recourse
to the indirect method of construction. The real decision however
depends entirely upon usage.

‘*Oils*.’—This term stands for butter, oil, fat and bone-marrow—(24).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The first half of the verse cuts off the preceding section; and what is
implied by this cutting off of the section is that the section that has
gone before pertains to the twice-born castes only, not to *Śūdras*,
while what follows applies to *Śūdras* also. It is for this reason that
several methods of eating meat shall be described, and the reward
resulting from the giving up of meat-eating shall accrue to the *Śūdra*
also. If this were not so, then, in the matter of eating meat also, the
*Śūdra* would be free to do what he likes; just as he is in regard to
the eating of garlic and other things that has been forbidden for
‘twice-born persons’ only, in verses 5 *ete. etc*. above.

“If it is as you say, then there is the following difficulty:—In verse
32 below, the Text is going to declare the eatability of the meat left
from the worship of the Gods:—*viz*. ‘One does not become contaminated
by sin if he eats meat after having worshipped the Gods and the
Pitṛs’;—now the ‘worship of the gods’ etc. can be done only with such
meaf as is sacred; and those beasts and birds that have been forbidden
for twice-born people (in the next section) are not sacred; hence, the
worshipping of Gods etc. with the meat of these beasts and birds being
impossible,—and what does not form the ‘remnant of worship’ being unfit
to be eaten,—these other beasts and birds also, mentioned in a different
context, become forbidden for the twice-born people; and the prohibition
of these could be made to apply to the *Śūdra* also by some such other
method (of reasoning). So that there is no point in the dividing of the
sections (simply for making the prohibitions of the next section
applicable to *Śūdras* also). And as for the prohibition of garlic and
such things (that have been forbidden specially for twice-born persons),
it is not applicable to *Śūdras* at all.”

There is this useful purpose served by the dividing of the two sections,
that the prohibition of garlic and other things ceases to be applicable
to the *Śūdra*. As regards meat also, in as much as the *Householder*
only is entitled to do the worshipping of Gods, it is a matter purely
optional for such *Śūdras* as are not ‘householders’.

“As a matter of fact, *Śūdras* also are entitled to the performance of
sacrifices with cooked food; the eating of food has also been prescribed
for Householders; but no ‘sacrifices with cooked food’ are ever offered
with garlic and such other things. So that these things may be eaten, or
not, by *Śūdras*, entirely according to their option.—‘Why’? What would
be the harm? In that case the mention of ‘twiceborn persons’ (in
connection with the forbidding of garlic, etc.) would have no point at
all.’

This has been already answered by the explanation that one who is not a
Householder, or who is travelling away from home, may do what he likes.
Nor is it necessary that the Householder shall not eat what has not been
offered in oblations; the meaning of the declaration ‘one shall live on
remnants’ being that ‘he shall not eat until he has made the offering to
the Vishedevas.’ Now, that substance alone is ‘sacred’, and can be
offered as oblation, which has been prescribed as to be offered at, and
thus helping the fulfilment of, a sacrifice. Some people fetch food from
somewhere, at the time of eating, and eat it in their own house; and in
this case even though the food may not be the ‘remnant of a sacrifice’,
it would not be forbidden. As regards *meat* however, we have the
restriction directly imposed, that ‘it shall never be eaten unless it
has been offered to the Gods.’

“If this is applicable to all the four castes, then there is no point in
what is going to be said (under 5.57) in connection with purifications.”

The use of that we shall explain at that place.

“In view of the mention of *twice-born people* in the foregoing section,
it follows that *day’s meat* and such things also are fit to be eaten by
*Śūdras*.”

Under Discourse XI we shall show that there are indications to the
effect that ‘the village-pig’, the ass, the camel, and other animals
mentioned in the three verses (157 etc.) are ‘unfit to be eaten’ for the
*Śūdra* also.—(26).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 526), which adds the
following notes:—The rules regarding eating that have gone before are
meant for the ‘twice-born’, not for the Śūdra; hence for the latter
there is no harm in eating garlic and other things. But, according to
*Kalpataru*, the eating of the crow and such like animals and birds—even
though included among those mentioned,—must be considered wrong, even
for the Śūdra;—being as they are entirely condemned by all cultured
men.—The mention of the ‘twice-born’ in this verse implies that the
forthcoming prohibition regarding meat is meant for all the four castes.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.179).—‘When one’s life is in danger, at Śrāddhas, when
it has been prepared for Brāhmaṇas, and when it has been offered in the
worshipping cf gods and Pitṛs, if one eats meat, one incurs no sin.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 251).—‘Invited at a Śrāddha, if one abandons the
meat that is offered, one remains in hell, etc., etc.’

*Mahābhārata* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 528).—‘Now listen to the law
relating to Kṣatriyas. He incurs no sin if he eats meat obtained by his
own valour; all wild animals are such as have been already offered to
the gods by Agastya; that is why hunting is an honoured practice; it is
for this reason that all royal sages go about hunting, and thereby they
incur no sin.’

*Viśvāmitra* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 528).—(Same as Yājñavalkya,
above.)

*Devala* (Do.).—‘Eating meat in course of eating the remnants of
offerings, one incurs no sin; similarly, if one eats as a medicine, or
for saving his life, or by invitation, or at sacrifices.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 529).—‘One may eat consecrated meat
*once*, for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa; also when invited at a rite in
honour of gods or Pitṛs.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 529).—‘Under the following four
circumstances alone should one eat meat—(a) when suffering from an
otherwise incurable disease, (b) when duly invited, (a) when the meat
has been offered as a libation, and (d) when invited by a Brāhmaṇa.
Apart from these one shall never eat meat.’

*Hārīta* (Do. 530).—‘If one eat needlessly-prepared meat, one should
perforin the Kṛcchra. But for the sake of the Brāhmaṇas, he may eat as
much as he likes.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The remnant of the meat of the animal sacrificed at the *Agniṣṭoma* is
figuratively called ‘consecrated’.

“The term ‘*prokṣita*’ literally means *sprinkled with water*, being
derived from the root ‘*ukṣa*,’ ‘to sprinkle’; and it is in this sense
that the word has been used in all such expressions as ‘bring the
*prokṣaṇī* water-vessels,’ ‘butter is th e *prokṣaṇa*, the
sprinkling-material,’ ‘*prokṣaṇībhiḥ udvejitāḥ*,’ ‘bothered by
sprinkings (sprinklings?),’ and so forth. Thus then, if the word
literally means ‘what is done by sprinkling,’ then why should such terms
us are expressive of certain consecrations prescribed in the Veda, (such
as *sprinkling with water* and the like), be taken as indirectly
indicating the animal (sacrificed) and its meat? Why should the direct
signification of the word be abandoned in favour of an indirect
indication? For these reasons it is better to take the text to mean
‘meat *sprinkled with water and such liquids*’.”

What is urged would be quite true, if there were no other texts and
commendatory passages bearing upon the matter; such as we have in the
shape of such texts as ‘Unconsecrated meat etc.’ (Verse), ‘Animnls not
consecrated with sacred texts etc.’ (36). A careful examination of all
these texts leads to the conclusion that the meaning of the word is as
we have explained it.

“If so, then what is said here being already mentioned in the texts
quoted, what would be the use of the present text?”

Some people say that the present verse is purely re-iterative. It cannot
be an injunction of eating meat when one wishes to do so. Because the
man who is hungry and wishes to cat meat can take to it through his
desire to relieve his hunger (and he does not need an injunction for
that). That is called an ‘Injunction’ which points to such activity of
the agent as would not be possible under the influence of any ordinary
visible motive; such injunctions, for instance, as ‘one shall perform
the *Agnihotra* through out his life;’ and on such a matter, the
scripture is the sole source of knowledge (and authority) available. We
need not seek for scriptural authority in the case of the acts in
connection with which we have the positive and negative notions to the
affect that—‘if it is done, such and such a reward shall follow—,and if
it is not done, such and such an evil shall befall us.’ And it is only
when there is no such source of knowledge available, and the matter is
knowable by means of scriptures alone, that it becomes a case of
‘Injunction.’ As regards the case in question, even infants at the
breast know, without being told, that eating brings strength and removes
pain. \[So that the present text cannot be regarded as an Injunction\].
Nor again can it be taken as a Restrictive Injunction, for the simple
reason that no such sense of restriction is recognised (as conveyed by
the words), (*a*) For instance, if the *restriction* were in the form
‘one must eat what has been consecrated,’—then, since no time is
specified the due observance of this injunction would disturb the entire
routine of food and rest, and the man may have to be eating constantly;
so that an impossible act will have been enjoined in this case. It has
been said that—‘one who eats not at Śrāddhas etc.’,—and again ‘the day
on which he is remiss etc.’ Then again, the author of the *Mahābhāṣya*
has declared that a Restriction is always supplementary to an
Injunction; so that when there is no Injunction, how can there be any
Restriction? What has been ‘consecrated’ by one man cannot be obtained
by another man; so that every man will have to eat all the meat that he
consecrates, and this would entail a great calamity, (*b*) If. on the
other hand, the restriction be taken to be in the form of
preclusion—‘one shall eat *only what is consecrated*, and not what is
not consecrated,’—on the ground of its fulfilling the condition of
‘Preclusion’, that hunger cannot be alleviated except by the eating of
both consecrated and unconsecrated food, either simultaneously or one
after the other;—even so this would be already implied by what has been
said above regarding ‘consecrated meat’ (in verse 7). (So that in this
case also there would be no point in taking the present text as an
Injunction.)

Others however find the following fault in the above view:—if all
unconsecrated meat were forbidden, birds would fall in the category of
‘forbidden food’; specially us there is no authority for any such
restricted view that those alone are forbidden in their unconsecrated
form, in connection with which consecration has been enjoined (and no
consecration has been enjoined regarding birds).

Some people regard this view as improper. Because even so, the text
cannot but be regarded as implying (if not directly asserting) the
prohibition of (unconsecrated) birds also.

For these reasons, in as much as every Restriction is subservient to
some enjoined act, it appears better to regard the present text as
purely re-iterative of the eatability of consecrated meat. Just as at
sacrifices, one must eat the consecrated meat, and omitting to eat it
involves disobedience of the scriptural Injunction, so would it be in
connection with all other occasions (on which meat is consecrated). And
when the text is purely reiterative, it may also imply a preclusion (as
shown above). The rule that ‘one shall not eat the unconsecrated meat of
the cow, the sheep and the goat’ would only be a reiteration of the
uneatability of ‘unconsecrated meat’ (mentioned in verse 7);—this
reiteration in the present verse serving the purpose of permitting the
eating of *unconsecrated* meat also, ‘at the wish of Brāhmaṇas’, and
under certain other circumstances (specified in the present verse).

Others again have taken the following view.—Under 4.213 we have the
mention of ‘needlessly prepared meat,’ and the present verse serves the
purpose of explaining what the ‘needlessly prepared meat’ is; as in the
absence of this it could not be known what is ‘needlessly prepared
meat’.

Or, it may be that in one verse we have the rule for the enter (who does
the consecration himself), while what the other means is that other
persons, guests and others, shall not eat the meat belonging to (and
offered by) a person who has not performed the worship of the Gods, etc.
(and consecrated the meat at it). In the event of the householder being
somehow not entitled to worship the Gods, his guests and other persons
would be justified in doing that worship for him; and if the meat has
been consecrated at such a worship, then they may eat it. The second
prohibition (of unconsecrated meat)—‘one incurs no sin by eating meat
after having worshipped the Gods and the Pitṛs’ (Verse 32)—is meant for
those persons who are capable of performing the worship at their own
house and have not performed it. What is stated in verse 36—‘animals not
consecrated by sacred texts etc.’—is meant to be explanatory of what is
meant by the term ‘consecration.’

Thus we have shown that all the five prohibitive passages have five
distinct meanings and serve distinctly useful purposes.

‘*At the wish of the Brāhmaṇas*’—‘*Brāhmaṇañca kāmyayā*’—‘*kāmyā*’ is
*kāmanā, ‘wish*’; the form ‘*kāmyā*’ being a Vedic anachronism.

“If this text permits the eating of unconscrated meat at the wish of the
*Brāhmaṇas*, then what is the sense of this restriction? Does it mean
that if one omits to eat at their wish, he incurs the sin of disobeying
the scriptures? Or, does the present section set forth only a
counter-exception? If it is a mere counter-exception, then such
counter-exception, setting aside the force of the prohibition, would be
available also in the shape of such assertions as ‘meat may be eaten at
marriages’.”

The text does not mean that one *must* eat meat under the circumstances;
all that is meant is that if the Brāhmaṇas are very superior persons,
then the disobeying of their wish would not be right.

Others again construe the term ‘of Brāhmaṇas’ with verse 32 also, and
take the present text as an Injunction for the eating of meat of the
hare and other animals also; the sense being that—‘at sacrifices and
marriages, or at other large dinner-parties, if the Brāhmaṇas request
one to eat meat, then the meat of such animals should not be regarded as
forbidden, as they ane, by their very nature, consecrated to the Gods’;
and it is only under special circumstances that consecration and worship
of the Gods etc. may be performed. In fact it is only those kinds of
meat that have been forbidden under certain circumstances whose eating
is sanctioned, at the wish of Brāhmaṇas; and the sanction does not apply
to the eating of ‘carnivorous birds’ and the rest, or to the case of a
man who has resolved to give up meat in view of ‘ceasing to eat meat
being conducive to highest results,’—irrespective of the fact of the
meat being either ‘consecrated’ or ‘unconsecrated,’ or ‘offered’ or ‘not
offered.’

All that is meant by the present text is that the man who is entitled to
receive the *Madhuparka* offering shall eat the unconsecrated meat that
may be offered to him; and it does not contain an Injunction of offering
the *Madhuparka*. The person meant here as the recipient of the
*Madhuparka* is the Guest, and not the king and other honoured persons;
just as we find it laid down for the Householder that ‘the guest shall
not dwell in his house without eating.’ From this it would follow that
nothing shall be offered to the guest against his desire. As for the
notion that one may do what he likes in the matter of receiving an
honoured guest and in feeding him,—if this idea were acted up to, then
those acts would not have been done ‘for the sake of the guest.’

“But the position of the *guest*. also is uncertain.”

True; but it has been found that the performance of the act brings
spiritual merit by producing pleasure in the recipient’s mind. Hence it
is that by way of a rule it has been laid down for the giver, in
accordance with the practice by which the calf is offered, that ‘there
can be no *Madhuparka* without meat.’

“What is herein laid down may be regarded as pertaining to the case of
priests officiating at one’s sacrifice.”

In that case, this also, like the preceding clause, may be only
reiterative of what pertains to the officiating priest and to
*Śrāddhas*.

“But in connection with the work of the priests, the eating of the *Iḍū*
and such other materials has been prescribed; and the restrictions
bearing upon that pertains to the *Sacrifice*, and not to the priests.”

True; but if the priests do not eat, they are censured, and also become
beset with transcendental evil. Even if they eat, they do not become
related to the result following from the act. Servants employed on wages
(such as the priests are) perform the details prescribed in the
scriptures; and it has been prescribed that ‘the priests along with the
sacrificer as the fifth eat the *Iḍā* cake,;’ so that it is incumbent
upon those who have accepted the priestly office to do that eating. And
in that case it is only right that this eating should be reiterated.
There is however nothing^(‘)scriptual’ in the eating done by persons
eating at *Śrāddhas* or by the priests. So that the reiteration is of
the eating done by the sacrifices—It may be asked—“For what purpose is
this reiteration?”—But reiteration does not always need a purpose. All
that is done is that it reiterates what has been enjoined elsewhere.
Similarly in the case in question also, if the owner of the cow has
promised to honour the guest with the killing of the cow, then the guest
must eat it; for he accepts the offering of *Madhuparka* as a favour to
the offerer; so that it is necessary that he should accomplish the act
preceding the offering. Otherwise, in the event of the *Madhuparka* not
being accepted, the said favour would not be bestowed; consequently in
the matter of the eating of forbidden meat, it is necessary for the man
at the very outset to accept the *Madhuparka* and the duties of the
priest:—similarly in the matter of feeding the Brāhmaṇas. As regards the
Student, since certain strict observances have been prescribed for him,
meat should be regarded as altogether ‘unfit to be eaten.’

^(‘)*When his life in in danger*’.—From the context it follows that what
is meant is that—‘in the event of his not eating meat without
worshipping the gods, and no other food being available, if there be a
fear of his losing his life, either though disease of through hunger,
one may eat the cow, the sheep and the goat.’ This rule is based upon
the Vedic declaration that ‘one shall protect himself from everything.’
So that under the circumstances, if one omits to eat meat, he becomes
his own murderer; and suicide has been forbidden by such text as—(*a*)
‘One shall protect himself from everything’; (*b*) ‘Hence the man,
expecting to live to the fullest extent of human life, shall never kill
himself with a desire to proceed to heaven; as such an act would make
him unfit for heaven’;—all which shows that by eating even forbidden
meat to save his life, one does not incur sin. Says the Mantra also
(Iśopaniṣad 3)—‘Those who kill themselves go, after death, to those
regions that are covered by blind darkness and are fit only for demons.”

When there is danger to life, even the Student may eat meat; and for him
his young age would necessitate the performance of the expiatory rite as
prescribed in the text—‘If the Student ever eats meat and honey, etc.’
(1?.158). Vyāsa has declared that when there is *tear* of losing one’s
life through hanger, one may eat even forbidden meat; and by the
instance of the ‘dog’s thigh’ (eaten by Viśvāmitra) it is indicated that
such meat may be eaten, but once only.

From this it follows that in the case of serious developments of
diseases, where one cannot be sure that the man will certainly recover
by eating meat, one shall not eat forbidden meat, such as that of the
village-cock and the like; though it is permitted to eat such meat as
has been consecrated or offered to the gods.

In the case of disease also one shall not eat meat for the purpose of
recovering from a disease that may have just set in; but in the case of
men who have become enfeebled and emaciated through disease, the eating
of meat is always permitted: as asserted in the verse—‘Persons daily
addicted to wine and women, consumptives, those emaciated through
fatigue and disease, as also enfeebled patients, live upon the juices of
meat.’ It is necessary for these persons to worship the gods in the case
of the meat of unconsecrated goat: there would however be no harm, if on
some day this be not found possible.—(27).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 527), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Prokṣita*’ is that which has been sanctified by means
of *mantras* for being offered at a sacrifice;—‘*brāhmaṇānañca
kāmyayā*’—when one is pressed by a Brāhmaṇa to eat meat, if he eats it
but *once*, then there is no harm; that this is justifiable *once* only
is clearly stated by Yama; if the same Brāhmaṇa should press him again,
then he is not to accede to this; nor is he to eat it, even though the
second time he may be pressed by another Brāhmaṇa; that he is to eat it
*once* does not mean that he is to take a *single morsel*; what is meant
is that he may eat at a single meal;—‘*Yathāvidhiniyuktaḥ*’—this, means
that when invited to the *Madhuparka-offering* or to a *Śrāddha*, one
may eat even unconsecrated meat;—‘*prāṇānāmeva cātyaye*’—meat may be
eaten if during an illness, or during food-scarcity, one’s life would be
in danger if meat were not taken.

The verse is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 449), which explains
‘*prokṣitam*’ as which has been duly consecrated by means of *mantras*,
being obtained from an animal killed in connection with a sacrificial
performance;—‘*brāhmaṇānām kāmya*’—at the wish of a Brāhmaṇa one may eat
once;—‘*yathāvidhiniyuktaḥ*’—*i*. *e*., at a *Śrāddha*;—in the
*Prāyścittaviveka* (p. 280), which notes that ‘*prāṇānāmeva cātyaye*’ is
meant to refer to Religious Students and to such House-holders as have
renounced meat;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 300).

‘*Vital spirit*,’—‘the breath within the body, the very seed of life.
For the sustenance of this breath, as functioning in the fivefold form
of ‘*Udāna*’ and the rest,—and for its maintenance in the
body,—‘*Prajāpati created all this*’—world—as food.

Having indicated the world in a general way, by means of the pronoun
‘*this*’, the author proceeds to specify it in details—‘*all that is
movable or immovable*’. All this, on account of what is said in the
first half, is the ‘*food of the vital- spirit*’. The second ‘all’ is
not redundant, since it is added with a view to indicate the various
kinds of beings,—beasts, birds, men, reptiles, etc.

Since Prajāpati has ordained all this to be ‘food’ in times of distress,
all of it is the food of the vital spirit. This is also what we read in
the dialogue of the Vital Breath contained in the Upaniṣads—‘He
asked—what shall be my food?—Whatever exists, down to the dogs and down
to the insects and worms’—(28).

‘*The eating of meat*—in the form of offerings and oblations —‘*for
sacrifices*.’

‘*This* *is* *the div* *ine law*’;—this is what has been ordained by the
Gods.

‘*Behaviour contrary to this*,’—*i.e*. eating meat for the fattening of
the body—is ‘*the* *demonical pract* *ice*’; it is only demons that eat
meat in this fashion. This is said in deprecation of the practice.—(31)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 527), which adds the

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The law here laid down refers to the meat of deer and birds. The meaning
is that there is no sin incurred in eating the meat of the *Ruru*, the
*Pṛṣat* and other kinds of deer, or the partridge and other birds, if it
is done after having worshipped the Gods and the Pitṛs.

In the case of the offering to the Viśvedevas, when there is no
preparation for it in the house, one may eat rice and other things, even
without making the offering; but not so meat; it is with a view to
emphasise this that the text repeats—‘*having worshipped the Gods and
the Pitṛs etc*.’ If mere sanction to eat after worship were meant, this
has already been accorded before.

What is meant by the ‘worshipping of the Gods’ here is the offering of
the meat on a clean spot with the words ‘this is for the Gods’; or that
‘the worship of the Gods’ should be done in such terms as—‘this to Agni,
to Vāyu, to Surya, to Jātavedas.’ That this must be the meaning of the
‘worship’ is proved by the fact that ‘offering of oblations into the
fire’ (which could he the other meaning ‘worshipping the Gods’) is not
possible for persons other than Agnihotrins; nor can there be any
offering made to the Gods without oblations having been poured into the
fire; specially as it has been already shown that the two are distinct
actions and involve distinct methods of procedure. This mutter may rest
here for the present.

Others have explained the ‘worship of the Pitṛs’ to mean *Śrāddha*; and
in *Śrāddhas* we do find worshipping being done. It is the Pitṛs again
that are spoken of as the ‘deities’ of the *Śrāddha*. Hence it is that
in connection with the Pitṛs, all writers on *Smṛti* have prescribed the
*Śrāddha* only, and no other act.

“How can the *buying* of meat be permissible? The meat obtained from the
market becomes ‘*Sa?na*’, ‘butcher’s meat’ (which has been forbidden);
and as for the meat of animals dying of themselves, and not killed by
the butcher, this is ‘unfit for eating’, on the ground of its causing
disease.”

Our answer to the above is that one can always ‘buy’ the meat brought by
fowlers and bird-catchers; and these are known us ‘butchers’; and they
wander about from house to house, carrying meat for sale, when it is
possible to *buy* it; and it does not become ‘butcher’s meat.’

‘*Having obtained it himself*,’—the Brāhmaṇa by begging it’ and the
*Kṣatriya* by hunting.—(32)

That is called ‘*unlawful*’ which is done apart from the
above-sanctioned occasions—of the worshipping of the Gods, the wish of
the Brāhmaṇas and so forth; and in this ‘unlawful’ manner one shall not
eat meat.

This is only a reiteration of what has been said before.

‘*In* *normal times*’.—In abnormal times of distress, when one’s life is
in danger, he need not wait for the worship of the Gods etc.

“*Danger to life* has already been sanctioned as one of the occasions on
which meat may be eaten; so that such eating would be quite *lawful*,
not *unlawful*.”

True; but what has been said on the previous occasion was in connection
with the *consecrated* meat of the cow, the sheep and the goat; and in
the present text the phrase ‘*in* *normal times*’ has been added with a
view to extend the sanction to the meat of the hare and other animals
also.

It is not the mere *knower* of the law that is called ‘*conversant with
the late*’ but one who, in practice acts up to the law. In connection
with ordinary worldly acts also the term ‘know,’ ‘be conversant with,’
is used in this sense; when it is said of a man ‘he knows this’, what is
meant is that ‘he acts up to it’.

When the question arises regarding the effect of the act in question,
the text says —‘*Having eaten meat unlawfully*,’—*i.e*. in a manner not
prescribed in the scriptures—‘*he shall, on death*, *he devoured*’, by
those animals. All that is meant—is that when a man eats meat in an
unlawful manner, he suffers various kinds of pain. If these were not
meant by the passage (and if it were taken in its literal sense),—then,
in as much us it is the meat of the goat that is commonly eaten by
people, and the goat is a not carnivorous animal \[how could it ‘devour’
its eater?\]

Or, the meaning may be that the eater, by virtue of the sin of that act,
comes to be devoured by carnivorous animals; and as this would be the
result of his having eaten the goat, he would be described as being
devoured by the goat.—(33)

In connection with animals-sacrifice, ‘sprinkling with water’ and other
consecrations have been laid down as to be done with sacred texts; and
one shall eat the meat of those animals for whom all these have been
performed, and which (thus) are the ‘remnants of sacrifices’ prescribed
in the Vedas. But in the case of the and other sacrifices that are
performed solely on the strength of usage (and for which there is no
injunction in the Veda),—even though the meat would he the ‘remnant of
sacrifice’, yet, since there would be no ‘consecration with sacred
texts’, it would be ‘unfit for eating’.

‘*Eternal*’—Vedic.

‘*Taking his stand*’—dependent.—(36)

People are likely to entertain such ideas as the following—“at the
*Sītā* - *yajña* the *Khañjikā-yāga*, the *Caṇḍikā-yāga* and the like,
which are performed on the authority of usage only, it is right for the
man desiring a certain result to kill animals; for it has been found
that one obtains a rich harvest by offering sacrifices at which animals
are killed.”

With a view to set aside such notions the text says—‘*It* *there is*
*occasion*,’—if necessity arises for the offering of an animal in
sacrifice,—‘*he shall make an animal of clarified butter*’; *i.e*., he
shall make clarified butter the sacrificial animal: that is, it being
necessary to otter an animal to the Gods, he shall offer, in its place,
clarified butter: which is as good a ‘sacrificial material’.

‘*Or, he shall make an animal of flour*’; *i.e*. he shall make the
figure of an animal with flour, and offer that figure to the Gods; or,
it may be taken to mean that ‘instead of the animal he shall offer cakes
and other things made of flour’.

“Why is this called *needless animal-slaughter*, when it is sanctioned
by the usage of cultured people?”

Since women, and *Śūdras* are ignorant of the Veda, such sacrifices as
those mentioned cannot be assumed to have any sanction in the Veda:
specially as people have reconrse (recourse?) to these sacrifices for
the purpose of propitiating the Gods, and no Vedic act is done for the
propitiating of Gods; for the simple reason that in connection with
Vedic rites, Gods have been mentioned as subordinate factors. In fact,
what they urge in support of the performance of the sacrifices in
question is the argument based upon negative and positive induction,
from the experience that there is rich harvest when Gods are propitiated
with the sacrifice of animals. For these reasons, these sacrifices
cannot be regarded as having the sanction of the Veda. As for the
positive and negative induction that also is entirely mistaken.

From all this it is clear that the present verse only reiterates what is
already indicated as the right course by al (all?) kinds of reasons: and
it has been put forward by the author through feelings of friendly
kindliness.—(37)

‘*Saṅge*’—‘On an occasion arising for the killing of an animal (at a
rite other than those laid down in the Veda)’ (Medhātithi);—‘if one has
a strong desire to eat meat’ (Kullūka and Nārāyanā). \[It is difficult
to see how a strong desire for meat could be appeased by eating animal
made of butter or flour\];—‘in the event of one being attacked by evil
spirits’ (Govindarāja);—‘on the occasion of social gatherings’
(Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 538), which quotes
*Kalpataru* as offering the following explanation:—In such ceremonies as
the *Sītāyajña* and the like, which are not prescribed in the Veda, and
the killing of animals at which, therefore, cannot have the sanction of
the Veda,—if, in view of the prevalent custom, it is found necessary to
sacrifice an animal, one should offer an animal made either of butter or
of flour;—it then quotes Kullūka’s explanation,—and then the one given
by Medhātithi, remarking that this last is in agreement with
*Kalpataru*,—It then goes on to describe another explanation, by which
‘*Saṅge*’ means ‘at a sacrifice’ and this is explained as laying down an
alternative to the killing of animals at the well-known sacrifices,
*Agnīṣṭomīya* and the rest.—This last explanation, the author rejects,
on the ground (1) that there is no authority for taking the word
‘*saṅge*’ in the sense of *sacrifice*, and (2) that it would not be
right for a *Smṛti* to lay down an alternative to a detail that has been
laid down in the original Vedic injunction of the sacrifices.

The evil just described does not pertain to the killing of animals at
the rites prescribed by *Śruti* and S *mṛti*.

That ‘killing’ which forms part of sacrifices,—for the due fulfilment of
that were animals ‘*created*’—produced, brought into existence,—‘*by the
self-born God*’—Prajāpati ‘*himself*.’

This is a purely commendatory passage.

‘*Sacrifice*’—in the form of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the rest—‘*is
conducive to the well-being*’—prosperity, development, advancement —‘*of
all this*’— world.

For this reason the killing that is done at a sacrifice should be
regarded as no killing at all. What this means is that it does not
involve the sin of ‘killing’ animals.—(39)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

“How is it known that killing at sacrifices involves no sin?”

The answer is as follows:—‘killing’ is the greatest injury that can
befall the being killed; because it involves such great evil as the loss
of life, involving separation from wife, children and riches, and all
the attendant evil consequences; and also because it carries the
entities nearer to the fruition of their sins in the form of hell and
the like. But when an animal is killed at a sacrifice, this killing
becomes a great benefit conferred upon it, and it is not an injury;
because it does not lead it to hell nr any such undesirable conditions.
That this is so follows from the fact that those ‘*reaching death*’—
destruction—at a sacrifice —‘*attain advancements*’—higher positions, in
regard to caste and so forth;—being born as a God or a Gandharva, or as
men born in better countries or continents—such as the Uttarakuru and
the like.

The whole of this is a purely commendatory description. We do not find
here any Injunction: the verb ‘*attain*’ being in the simple Present
tense. Nor is there any justification for deducing an Injunction from
the commendatory description,—as is done in the case of the passage
‘*Pratitiṣṭhanti etc*.’ (*v* *ide*, *Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra*, 4.3.17. *et seq*);
because in the present case neither there is, nor is there any
possibility of, any other Injunction (apart from those already set forth
in the text).

The whole of this descriptive section is supplementary to the
prohibition of the eating of unlawful meat; and the upshot of the
prohibition contained in these verses is that ‘one should never seek to
kill animals needlessly.’ (verse 37) As for the sanction (of killing)
implied in the statement—‘animals have been created for the purpose of
sacrifices’ (39),—all this is understood as involving the prohibition of
*eating* which is going to be distinctly emphasised below in verse 48.

Nor can any Injunction (such as ‘desiring advancement, the animal shall
die at a sacrifice’) be deduced from the text. Because such an
Injunction could not be intended for the animals; for the simple reason
that they would not understand it. And those for whom the Injunction is
not intended cannot be the agent; and unless one is an agent, he cannot
obtain any reward declared in the scriptures. Specially as in the
present case, the result spoken of does not proceed in any perceptible
manner from the nature of the thing involved; as there is, for instance,
in the case of the poison, which produces its results even on ignorant
persons who take it. There is no such thing in the case of things spoken
of in the Veda.

Further, since the herbs and other things spoken of here ore unconscious
beings, the ‘principle of the priests’ cannot apply to their case. That
is to say, it is found that in the case of sacrificial performances,
results are spoken of as accruing to one person (the sacrificer) from
the acts that are actually done by others,—*i*. *e*., the priests
officiating for him; *e.g*., in the case of the passage—‘he desires one
to become worse etc,’ In the case of such passages we admit of an
Injunction, because what is there stated is not capable of being taken
as supplementary to any other Injunction, and secondly because the
indication of the Injunction, is quite clear, and lastly, because the
Injunction indicated is found to be one that pertains to human beings.

In the case of all scriptural statements, we are entitled to deduce just
as much us may be reasonably deduced from the actual words of the text.
For instance, it has been declared that the Brāhmaṇa joining in the
sacrificial bath of other people should have to perform an expiatory
rite \[and we have to accent this, even though we fail to see any reason
for it\]. In the present case, however, there is no possibility of any
Injunction being addressed to the beings concerned (all of which are
inanimate).

‘*Herbs*,’—grass and the like.

‘*Animate*,’—the goat and other beasts (which are mentioned as fit for
being offered at sacrifices).

‘*Trees*,’—such as are objects of worship.

‘*Beasts*,’—those which, though not ordinarily regarded as fit for
sacrificing, happen to be mentioned, in some passages, as to be offered;
*e.g*., ‘one shall kill *partridges*.’ Though at the *Vājapeya* and
similar sacrifices, the calves are used only for the purpose of carrying
loads, yet they are called ‘beasts;’ and even though these do not suffer
actual *death*, yet the term ‘death’ in their case stands for all the
sufferings that they undergo.

‘*Bird*.”—the Kapiñjala and the rest; even though these are sometimes
spoken of as ‘animals’, yet, as a rule, they are not known by that name:
for in such passages as there are seven tame animals and seven wild
animals’, the animals meant are the cow and the rest, which are *not
birds*; in fact the term ‘*paśu*’, ‘animals, denotes *quadrupods*; or
the difference between ‘animals’ and ‘birds’ may be regarded as similar
to that between the ‘*go*’ and the^(‘)*balvarda*’ (the former term being
wider than the latter) (40).

the ‘*Rātrisattra-nyāya*’. In connection with the ‘*Rātri*’ offerings,
it is said that ‘he who offers these obtains respectability &c.’ and in
regard to this the question arises whether this latter passage is a mere
*arthavāda*, or it describes the result that really follows from the
offerings; and the conclusion is that, inasmuch as no other mention of
the result of the offerings is found anywhere, the passage in question
must be taken as describing the results actually following from them.

The present text sums up in brief those occasions on which the killing
of animals is sanctioned by the scriptures.

‘*Madhuparka*’— has been already described. At this the killing of the
calf has been enjoined.

‘Sacrifice’—such as the Jyotiṣṭoma and the like; the eleventh stage of
which consists of the animal-sacrifice; as also the *Paśubandha*, at
which the sacrificing of the animal forms a sacrifice by itself.

‘*Rites in honour of the Pitṛs*,’—*i.e*., those of which the Pitṛs are
the ‘deities’; what are meant are the *Aṣṭaka* and other offerings of
the kind, and not *Śrāddhas*; because these latter are laid down as to
be performed with *cooked* meat, (for which the meat could be obtained
otherwise than by actually killing the animal at the rite itself): and
in connection with this the killing of animals has not been enjoined;
nor will it be right to regard this (injunction regarding the offering
of *cooked* meat) as implying the killing of animals: because the
original injunction of the *Śrāddha* does not lay clown such *killing*.
Further, the present verse also does not clearly enjoin it: specially as
what is here mentioned is capable of being taken as pertaining to the
*Aṣṭaka* offerings. If the present verse were an injunction, it would
involve the necessity of seeking for its basis (in some Vedic text):
while, as we shall explain later on, it is capable of being construed as
supplementary to another Injunction.

Some people explain the term ‘*pitṛdaivatakarma*’ as standing for *the
rites performed in honour of the gods and the Pitṛs i.e*., the Great
Sacrifices (daily).

Animals are to be killed by Brāhmaṇas for the ‘support of their
dependents,’ and the killing of animals is also permitted at times of
distress, when life may be in danger—(41-42).

This verse forbids such killing as is not sanctioned by the Veda, it is
not meant, to sanction that which is already sanctioned by it.

As a matter of fact, no other killing (save what is sanctioned) is
possible in the case of the Student ‘living with his teacher,’ or of the
man performing austerities ‘in the forest;’ even though some sort of
killing may be possible for the *incontinent* Student, yet for the
Hermit in the forest it is not possible in any case. Even for the
Student, an absolute indifference to life (and livelihood) is not
considered desirable. Hence the present verse should he treated as the
Injunction of killing at *Śrāddhas*; and the mention of the ‘house’ is a
mere reiteration (Śrāddhas being performed only by the Householder).

Some people argue here as follows:—“if this were such an Injunction,
what would be the meaning of the terms ‘*in* *the forest*’ and ‘*in
times of* *distress*’? For the Recluse in the forest, even though
keeping up his Fire, there are no animul-sacrifices: as we shall show
under 6.11.”

Our Teacher however gives the following explanation;—What is urged may
be true of the Student: as regards the Recluse, even ‘self-abandonment’
has been enjoined by such texts as ‘having recourse to the Aparājitā,
etc. etc.’ So that for him there can be no killing for saving his life;
all this we shall clearly explain under 6.31.

“The present verse puts forward the *prohibition* of killing even in
*times of distress*; how then is it that you take it to mean the
permission of it at such times?”

True; but otherwise (if the text were not taken as permitting killing as
sanctioned by the Veda), it would be useless. It might be argued that it
could serve the purposes of a commendatory text. But even for a
commendatory text, some sort of basis (some injunctive text to which it
is supplementary) will have to be sought out. Hence we conclude that the
prohibition contained in the verse relates to normal times—other than
those of distress; and there is nothing incongruous in its being
sanctioned in connection with abnormal times of distress. Further, there
are various degrees of ‘distress’; and under the lesser forms of it, if
one would take to ‘killing’ animals for food under the consideration
that his food-supply was sufficient only for a month or a fortnight
(after which he will have nothing to eat),—then such killing (even
though at an abnormal time of distress) would be what is forbidden by
the present text; on the other hand, if the man fears that he would die
now if he did not kill for food,—or if a desperado with uplifted weapon
were attacking him,—then the killing has to be done; and it is this
killing in abnormal times of distress that is permitted by the text.

In this manner the Vedic text ‘one should protect himself from all
things’ also becomes reconciled. (43).

The killing of creatures which has been prescribed in the Veda, ‘*has
been eternal*’— without beginning—‘*in this world of mobile and immobile
beings*;’ on the other hand, that which is laid down in the *Tantra* and
other works is modern, and based upon mistaken induction. Hence it is
only the former that is to be regarded as ‘*no killing at* *all*’; and
this for the reason that it does not involve any sin in reference to the
other world. When this killing is called ‘no killing,’ it is only in
view of its effects, and not in view of its form (which of course is
that of *killing* ).

“Since both acts would be equally *killing*; how can there be any
difference in their effects *?*”

The answer to this is—‘*because it was out of the Veda that the Law
shone forth*’;—the promulgation of what is lawful (right) and what is
unlawful (wrong) proceeded from the Veda; human authorities not being at
all trustworthy. And as a matter of fact, the Veda is found to declare
that in certain cases, killing is conducive to welfare. Nor is there an
absolute identity of form (between the two kinds of killing); because
firstly there is the difference that, while one is done for the sake of
accomplishing a sacrifice, the other is done for entirely personal
motives; and secondly there is difference in the intention also, that
is, ordinary killing is done either by one who desires to eat meat, or
by one who hates the creature (killed), while the Vedic killing is done
because the man thinks that ‘it is enjoined by the scriptures’.

‘*Shone forth*’— Shone fully; *i.e*., became manifested.—(44).

This verse show’s that all the verses forbidding the killing of animals
are auxiliary to the prohibition of meat-eating.

As a matter of fact, until animals have been killed, meat cannot be
obtained; and killing is very painful. Hence one should avoid meat.

“Meat can be obtained from animals that die of themselves; how is it
then that it is said that it cannot be obtained *without encompassing
the death of animals*?”

The verse is a purely commendatory exaggeration. Further, there can be
no idea of any one eating the meat of animals dying of themselves, for
the simple reason that such meat is the source of disease. Meat is never
eaten without being offered, and what is a source of disease can never
be offered as gift.

‘*Utpadyate*’;—the meat is brought about by *killing*; hence the
nominative of *hilling* and of *obtaining* may be regarded as one and
the same; so that there is nothing incongruous in the expression
‘*nākṛtvā utpadyate*’. Or, ‘*utpadyate*’ may be construed along with
‘*does not lead to Heaven*.’ What is meant is, not only that it does not
lead to heaven, but also that it leads to hell and other evils.—(48)

These verses are quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 719), which adds
that the prohibition contained here pertains to the eating of meat
obtained by such killing of animals as is prohibited,—and not to that of
meat obtained by purchase; and this on the ground that it is prefaced by
the deprecating of the act of *killing*.

Verse 48 only is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 279).

The foetus grows in the womb, which is an unclean place: and it is
produced from semen and ovule, both unclean things.

‘*Fettering and killing*’—involved in the obtaining of meat.

‘*Having duly pondered over*’—carefully considered with an alert
mind;—‘*all* *this*,—*one shall abstain from the eating of all*
*meat*’—*i.e*., also of that which is not forbidden; what to say of what
is actually forbidden?

The present text is a commendatory exaggeration: it is not meant that
meat should be always regarded as *unclean*; the sentence does not mean
to lay down that all meat is actually unclean.—(49)

^(‘)*Proper method*’—*i.e*., of worshipping the Gods and so forth; if
one does not eat meat, regardless of this manner, but eats it only in
the right manner,—^(‘)*he b* *ecomes popular*’—loved by the people: he
becomes dear to all.

‘He *is not afflicted by disease*.’—Diseases are produced if a man eats
the flesh of lean and enfeebled animals. For this reason also one should
eat meat only in the right manner; and by eating it thus, he ‘*is* *not
afflicted* *by* *disease*.’ By eating meat in any other way, he is
always afflicted by disease.

‘*Like a fiend*.’—The term ‘fiend’ stands for a species of lower
animals, which eat flesh always in the wrong manner; hence every one who
eats it in the wrong manner becomes like a fiend;—this is the sense of
the deprecatory simile.—(50).

When some one is killing an animal, if another person should come, and
for his own selfish purposes show his approbation, by such words as ‘he
is doing well in thus killing the animal,’—this latter man is called
the, ‘*approver*’.

‘*He who cuts*.’—he who quarters the dead body.

‘*He who* *serves*’—places it before persons eating.

‘*He who eats it*’.

All these are ‘*slayers*’.

What is meant by attributing the character of the ‘*slayer*’ to those
who do not actually *slay*, but do the other acts of eating, preparing,
selling, &c.,—is the deprecation of all these acts; all these persons do
not actually become ‘*slayers*.’ The ordinary act of ‘slaying’ is that
which results in loss of life: so that it is only one who does this act
that is the ‘slayer.’ In accordance with the rule that ‘the nominative
agent of an act is one who does it independently by himself,’ that
person alone is called the ‘slayer’ who deprives living beings of their
life; those who do the acts of buying, selling, etc., are other than
that person.

“But the statement that the approver and the rest also are *slayers*
also emanates from the *Smṛti* (and as such must be accepted as true).”

The authority of this *Smṛti* does not extend to the subject of words
and their denotations; it is confined to the subject of right and
wrong,—what is lawful and what unlawful. More authoritative on the
subject of words and their meanings is the revered Pāṇini. In fact Manu
and otther writers on *Smṛti* only make use of words in accordance with
ordinary usage, and they do not lay down rules bearing upon words and
their meanings; they use the words, they do not regulate them.

“But as a matter of fact, we do find these writers making such
assertions as ‘such and such a person is called a *Preceptor*’ and so
forth (which lay down the denotation of words).”

True; bat in such cases there is no inconsistency between what the
*Smṛti* says and what we learn from the treatises bearing upon the
subject. Nor again is there any other useful purpose found to be served
by those passages that explain the meaning of the term ‘preceptor’ (for
instance). In the present case, however the passage is capable of
serving an. auxiliary purpose by bring taken as a commendatory
statement; so that it is not possible, on the strength of the present
text alone, to regard all. these persons as ‘slayers.’

Some people argue as follows:—“If there is no one to *eat*, there would
be no one to kill; so that the *killing* is really prompted by the
*eating*; and the prompter of an act also has been regarded as its
*doer*; so that the *eater* is the *slayer*, even in the direct sense of
this term; and it is only right that the *eater* should have to perform
the same Expiatory Rite as the *slayer*.”

This, we say, is not right; because as a matter of fact, a different
expiatory rite has been prescribed, under Discourse XI for the *taster*
of the meat of the animals killed (by others).

What has been stated above regarding the *prompter* bring the *doer*,
that also is not true. The *prompting agent* has been thus defined—‘He
who by means of direction and request, prompts the independent agent, is
also an auxiliary agent, the other bring the principal one.’ And as a
matter of fact when the *slayer* kills the animal, hie is not ordered to
do so by the eater; be does it as u means of living, with the motive
that he shall live by selling the flesh.

If *prompting* means *abetting*,—*i.e*., if it be held that when a man
proceeds to do a certain act, if another person abets him and
co-operates with him, the latter is to be regarded as the
*prompter*—then, this definition also is not applicable to the present
case, in the act of *killing*, the ‘abetting’ would consist in such acts
as—(*a*) collecting the weapons, etc. (*b*) the sharpening of the
blunted axe, (*c*) the bringing up of the sword, and so forth; as
without these the act of *killing* could not be accomplished, \[and none
of these acts is done by the *eater* \].

If, however, the *prompter* be defined as ‘that person for whose take
the. work is done,’—then, in the case of the ‘teaching of the boy,’ the
boy would have to be regarded as the *prompting agent* in the act of
‘teaching’; and yet ‘teaching’ does not mean ‘reading’ (which is what
the boy actually does).

Then again, when the slayer does the *killing*, he does not do so for
the benefit of any particular person, by virtue of which the latter’s
action of *eating* could be regarded as sinful. In fact, all these
persons undertake these acts for their own benefit; and not one of them
is troubled by the idea of benefiting any other person.

“Even when the man undertakes the killing for his own benefit, such
action would be absolutely useless if there were no *eater*: it is only
when there is an *eater*, that the man’s action is fruitful; and the
*fruit* of an act is the motive, the ‘prompting force; and as this
depends upon the enter, the eater also is an indirect prompter.”

If this be so, then, when a person is murdered on account of enmity,
since the enemy would be the prompter of the act of killing, the
murdered man could become the murderer! For without enmity, the act of
murder would not be possible. Similarly when in the case of
Brāhmaṇa-murdcr, the murderer (in course of the Expiatory Rite) gives
away his entire property, the act of giving will have been prompted by
the *murder*: and as there could be no *recipient* without the giver, it
is not only the re-chastity, but the giver also that would beecome
tainted with the sin. Similarly a beautiful woman would incur sin by
guarding her chastity against the lover who has his heart burning with
the arrows of love and who has expressed his longing for her.

From all this it follows that what has been suggested cannot be the
definition of the *prompter*.

As a matter of fact, both the *slayer* and the *eater* do their
respective acts for their own special benefit: but they become helpful
to one another in the manner of two persons one of whom has lost his
horse and another his cart; and there can be no question of one being
the *prompter* of the other.

This has been fully discussed under 8.104.—(51).

This deprecates the man who eats meat for the purposc of fattening
himself, and not one who does it for averting disease. That this is so
is clear from the words of the text ‘*he who seeks to increase*.’ In him
also, only if he does it ‘*without worshipping the Gods and Pitṛs*.’ But
if the man is ill, and recovery is not possible without eating meat,
then there would be no harm, even if the said worshipping were not

If a man performs the Aśvamedha Sacrifice every year, for a hundred tears,—and another does not eat meat,—the merit and reward of both these are the same.—(53.)

The eating of the meat of the Hare and other animals,—in the form of
remnants of the worship of Gods and Pitṛs—has been sanctioned. If one
abstains from this eating, he obtains the fruits of the *Aśvamedha*
sacrifice; and the fruits of this sacrifice have been described in the
words ‘he obtains all desires, etc., etc.’

In this connection it would not be right to urge the following
objection:—“How can mere abstaining from meat be equal to a sacrifice
involving tremendous labour and much expense?”—Because the said
abstention also is extremely difficult. Further, the principle
enunciated in the Sūtra.—‘The particular result would follow from
development as in the ordinary world’—is operative here also. Hence
there can be no objection against the asserting of results or fruits of
actions.

Our answer however is us follows:—What is said in the text is a purely
commendatory exaggeration; socially because the statement of the
sacrifice being performed ‘every year for one hundred years’ can be
regarded only us such an exaggeration; for it is not possible for the
*Aśvamedha* to be performed every year; nor can it be performed ‘for a
hundred years,’ as no performer would live so long,

‘*Puṇyaphalam*’ is a copulative compound, it being impossible to take it
us a Genitive *Tatpuruṣa*.—(53).

In the Mahābhārata (13.114.15) this occurs as writer’s ‘*matam mama*,’
but it has ‘*māse*’ for ‘*varṣe*’—says Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.181), to the effect that the
merit of the performance of *Aśvamedha* accrues to one who renounces
meat for a full year;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 533), which
adds that according to Medhātithi, this is mere *Arthavāda*, and not the
declaration of a result that actually follows from the act,—this being
based upon the principle laid down by Jaimini under 4.3.1. It goes on to
add that this view is not right; as this case is not analogous to that
of Jaimini 4.3.1,

A ‘declaration of rewards’ is regarded as an ‘*Arthavāda*’ only when
there is some other passage mentioning another reward in connection with
the same act; in the present case, however, we do not find any other
passage speaking of any other rewards accruing from the renouncing of
meat for one year; so that this comes under the *Rātrisattranyāya*
(Jaimini 4.3.17 *et. seq*.; see note under verse 40). It concludes with
the remark that the reward accruing from the renouncing of meat for one
year,—even though of the same kind as that following from the
*Aśvamedha*—is of a much lower *degree*;—and quotes the following
*Kārikā* of ‘Bhaṭṭapāda’—

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

From verse 28 to this we have a series of purely commendatory texts;
there are only two or three verses that are injunctive in their
character.

‘*There is no sin in the eating of meat*.’ This assertion stands on the
same footing as verse 32 above. What we learn from the present verse (in
addition to what we know already) is that ‘*abstention is conductive to
great rewards*.’ By various deprecatory texts the impression has been
produced that ‘no meat should be eaten.’ But by way of providing a means
of living for living beings it has been asserted that ‘*there is no sin
in the eating of meat*’; which means that there is no sin if one eats
such meat as is the remnant of the worship of Gods, etc., or what is
eaten at the wish of Brāhmaṇas, and under such similar circumstances
specified above; but this only if he wish to eat it.

‘*Abstention*’—taking the resolve not to eat meat and then to abstain
from it—this is ‘*conducive, to great reward*.’ In the absence of the
mention of any particular reward, *Heaven* is to be regarded as the
reward. So say the *Mīmāṃsakas*.

Similarly in regard, to ‘wine’, for the *Kṣatriyas*,—and to ‘*sexual
intercourse*’, for all castes; but apart from that which may be alone
(*a*) ‘during the day’ or (*b*) ‘with women in their courses’, or ‘on
sacred days’, (in connection with all of which sexual intercourse has
been forbidden).

The three things mentioned, here, in their very restricted forms,
constitute the ‘natural way of living beings’, sanctioned by the
scriptures with a view to the maintenance of the body. Says the author
of the Science of Medicine (*Āyurveda*)—‘Food, continence and
sleep—these three, intoxicants and women, tend to prolong life.’

If, however, one can manage to live without these, for him ‘*abstention
is conucive to great rewards*.’ This is said merely by way of
illustration: same being the case with all ‘abstentions’ from such
things as are neither prescribed nor forbidden. Where however a certain
act is definitely prescribed, there is nothing reprehensible in the
man’s doing it, even if it be done only for the Bake of the pleasure
that it affords him; in fact *abstention* from such an act would itself
be reprehensible, as done with a view to ‘great rewards’; *e.g*. the
eating of honey, having a full meal, wearing a woolen garment and so
forth. Such also is the practice of cultured people; the revered Vyāsa
also says the same. Those acts, on the other hand, to which people have
recourse only through desire,—even though these be neither permitted nor
forbidden,—*e.g*. laughing, scratching of the body and so
forth,—abstention born these would be conducive to great rewards,—(56)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 719) in support of
the view that it is only the eating of prohibited meat that is
sinful;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 537), which adds the
following notes:—‘*māṃse*’—*i.e*., such meat as is not
forbidden;—‘*madye*’—for the *Kṣatriya* and other lower castes
;—‘*maithune*’—*i.e*., such sexual intercourse as is not
prohibited;—‘*nivṛttiḥ*’—*i.e*., the determination to
renounce;—‘*mahāphalā*’—*i.e*., conducive to the attainment of Heaven
and such other results as have been mentioned in the foregoing
*arthavāda* passages. *Medhātithi* has remarked that the determination
to renounce meat and other things must be regarded as conducive to
Heaven only, on the basis of the principle of the Viśvajit
(*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra* 4.3.15-16). But this is not right, as it is very much
simpler to accept the rewards mentioned in the *arthavāda* passages as
the rewards meant here, rather than assume one on the basis of the said
principle.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 277), which remarks that this
refers, to such meat as is left, after the offerings to the gods and
Pitṛs have been made;—as regards wine, the abandoning of it is
‘conducive to great rewards’ only for those for whom wine is not
forbidden,—and as regards ‘sexual intercourse,’ the abandoning that
leads to great rewards is that of the intercourse which is sanctioned
‘on all except the sacred days,’ and ‘that for the sake of pleasure.’

‘*Anujāta*’—is taken to mean *younger than the child that has*
*teethed*.

The present verse mentions the several stages only by way of
illustration, and much emphasis is not meant to be laid on them; since
the exact period of ‘impurity’ in regard to the various stages is going
to be prescribed later on; *e* .*g*., in another *Smṛti-text* we
read—(*a*) Till the appearance of teeth etc.’—(*b*) ‘When a child dies
in a foreign country, etc., etc.’ (5.77),—there is^(‘)*immediate
impurity*’;—where the term ‘child’ is to be understood as standing for
*one that has not teethed*. Thus too it. is that what the text (5.67)
says regarding the ‘one night’s impurity’ in connection with the death
of ‘persons whose tonsure has not been performed etc.’ is taken to be
applicable also to one who has teethed. It is in this way that the rules
laid down by the two *Smṛti-texts* in connection with the ‘child’ become
reconciled. In fact the ‘one night’s impurity’ pertains only to children
till the performance of the Tonsure; since in connection with those
whose Tonsure has been performed, the period of impurity is going to be
prescribed as to last for three days; and this applies to the case of
hoys before their Initiatory Ceremony; after which the period would be
ten days and so forth, as laid down in the text—‘The Brāhmaṇa is
purified in ten days, etc.’ (5.83).

Some people interpret the several alternative rules laid dowu in verses
5.59 *et* *seq*—‘Impurity due to death lasts for ten days’ etc.,
etc.,—as pertaining to the different ages (of the dying person), and
construe them differently from their natural order—on the strength of
usage and of other *Smṛti.texts*; by which (*a*) the impurity in
connection with the Initiated child lasts for ten days, (*b*) in
connection with the uninitiated for four days, (*c*) in connection with
one whose Tonsure has been performed, three days, (*d*) in connection
with one who has teethed, one day, and (*e*) in connection with younger
children, it is to be only ‘immediate’; and so forth. In this way there
would be an option between ‘three’ and ‘four’ days, in connection with
one whose Tonsure has been performed.

But in accordance with these views, there would be no notice taken of
the rule that has been prescribed in another *Smṛti-* text, in
connection with the death of the boy ‘who has completed his Vedic
Study’. All this we shall explain later on.

A person is called ‘dead’ when all his functions have ceased, and the
root ‘*sthā*’ with the prepositiou ‘*sam*,’ denotes *cessation of
functions*, \[Hence ‘*saṃsthita*’ means *de?a* \].

‘*Relations*’,—*i.e., Sapiṇḍas* (sharers in the ball-offering) and
*Samānodakas* (‘Sharers in the water-offering’).

‘*Jātaka*’ is the birth of a son, etc.

‘*The same is declared to be the case*’; *i.e*., all relations are
impure.

*Question*: “Whence is any notion of *age* obtained, by which the text
is interpreted as applying to one whose Tonsure has been performed, and
thus refering to a particular sacramental rite? In a later text, the
connection of the Initiatory Rite has been directly mentioned. But we do
not find it any where stated upto what age a child may be called
tonsured.”

Our answer to the above is as follows: By reason of its having been
mentioned along with ‘one who has teethed,’ the term ‘tonsure’ is
understood as indicating a definite age; and this age is to be taken as
extending upto the third or the fourth year.

It has been argued that—“Since there is the option of performing the
Tonsure during the first year, if one adopts this option, the present
rule (which extends the ‘impurity’ in the case of the^(‘)tonsured’ child
to one day) would be contrary to the rule that ‘upto the period of
teething, the impurity is only *immediate*’.”

This is not right. As a matter of fact, what is the extent of the
‘tonsured’ age we learn from the juxtaposition of the epithets ‘tonsure’
and ‘initiated’, which indicates that the new name becomes applicable
only upon the performance of the next sacramental rite \[so that the boy
could be regarded as ‘tonsured’ only till the performance of the
Initiatory Rite\]. In this way, the present text would become reconciled
with such texts as ‘Till teething, impurity is to be immediate.’
Similarly in the *Smṛti-* text—‘Till the ceremony of initiation it is to
be for three days’—the Initiatory ceremony is mentioned only as
indicative of a particular age. It might be argued that—“there would, in
this case be no age specified for the *Śūdra*, in the way in which it is
for the *Brāhmaṇa*, the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya*, in connection with
whom, the Initiation has been more or less strictly prescribed, as being
the eighth year and so forth.”—But in this case also, the age would be
understood as when the period of ‘childhood’ is passed; in accordance
with the law that ‘for all there is a full period of impurity.’ Thus
then, *after the eighth gear*, in case of all the four castes, the
period of impurity would be the full term’, and this age is applicable
to the case of the *Śūdra* also. In accordance with the view by which
the ‘Initiation’ in the present context is taken as indicating the
eleventh (and twelfth) year in the case of the Kṣatriya and the
Vaiśya,—there would be no age mentioned in connection with the *Śūdra*.
Though in his case also the period of impurity extends to the full time,
in the case of one who has passed his childhood; before which the period
extends to three days only: and the passing of childhood has been
defined in another *Smṛti-text*, which says—‘Upto the eighth year one is
called a *child*’, while others declare that ‘one is a *child* till his
sixteenth year.’ Those who hold that ‘childhood’ ceases after the
sixteenth year,—according to those also *purification* takes place only
after a month (the full term). It has also been declared that ‘after six
years, the purification of the Śūdra comes after a month’; and in
another text—‘one month in the case of the eight-year-old child’.

*Objection*—“The rules regarding the several ages are obtained from the
verses that follow; why then should the ‘teething’, etc., have been
specified in the present verse?”

*Answer*— True; but it bus been answered here also for the purpose of
making the rules more intelligible.—(58)

‘*Anujāte*’—‘Younger than one that has teethed’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda; and Kullūka also, who is not
rightly represented by Buhler).

‘*Ca*’—This includes ‘one whose *Upanayana* has been performed’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 239), which adds that
according to this the impurity attaches, not only to the *Sapiṇḍas*, but
also to *Sagotras, Samānodakas*, paternal relations, maternal relations
and so forth;—‘*anujāta*,’ literally meaning ‘bora after,’ means ‘*one
born after* the *dantajāta*,’ this latter being the noun immediately
preceding the word;—the presence of ‘*ca*,’ implies the ‘initiated’
also; ‘*saṃsthīte*’ means ‘dead.’

It is quoted in *Hāralatā* (p. 1), which adds the following
notes:—‘*anujāta*’ is the child born after the child that has cut its
teeth, *i.e*., a ehilçl that has not cut its teeth,—‘*kṛtacūḍe ca*,’ the
‘*ca*’ is meant to include one whose Upanayana has been
performed,—‘*saṃsthite*’ on his dying,—‘*sūtaka*’ stands here for the
impurity *due to birth*, that *duo to death* having been separately
mentioned.

*Āpastamba* (2.15.3.4).—‘On account of the death of children who have
not completed their first year, the parents alone shall bathe—and those
who bury them.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.26-31).—In the case of the child dying immediately after
birth, or one who is still-born, the impurity of the family ceases
immediately; for such a child there is no cremation, nor
water-oblations; in that of a child that has teethed hut whose tonsure
has not been performed, the impurity lasts for a day and night; in that
of one whose tonsure has been done, hut no other sacrament, three days.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.18.23).—‘Impurity due to death lasts for three or ten
days; if the dead is a child less than two years old, the impurity
attaches to the parents only; and that due to the birth attaches to the
mother only. In the case of the death of children before teething, the
impurity is only for the moment; in that of those after teething but
before tonsure, it lasts for one night; in that of those after tonsure,
hut before Upanayana, for three days;—after that, for ten days.’

The qualifications of the^(‘)*Sapiṇḍa*’ shall be described later on.

‘*Till the collecting of the bones*’;—this is meant to indicate the
period of *four days*;—since there is the text—‘The bone-collecting of
one who has set up the fire shall be done on the fourth day’.

The alternatives here laid down are in consideration of the man’s
character and Vedic learning, or of his character only; as says another
*Smṛti* -text,—‘The Brāhmaṇa who is equipped with the Veda only, in
three days, and he who has no qualifications, in ten days.’ The period
of ‘one day’ is meant for the man who knows *three Vedas* and has set up
the Fire; that of ‘three days’ far one who knows *one Veda* only; and
that of ten days for one who has no such qualifications.

Gautama (14.44) has spoken of ‘immediate purity.’ But this is for a
special purpose; all that is meant it that Vedic Study shall not cease.
During the period of Impurity, several acts are discontinued,—*e.g*. for
ten days, the food of the two families is not eaten; the making of
gifts, the receiving of them, the offering af (of?) oblations and Vedic
Study are discontinued; so that ordinarily all these acts would cease
during the period; but so far as the Student of several Vedas is
concerned, if he were not to repeat them regularly, he would forget
them; hence in his case Vedic Study shall not cease.

Similarly it is only right that an alternative should be provided, in
consideration of the mourner’s livelihood. For instance, for the man who
lives by the ‘six acts’ (of giving and receiving gifts, of sacrificing
and officiating at sacrifices, and Reading and Teaching), the impurity
lasts for ten days; for him who lives by the ‘three acts’ (of receiving
gifts, officiating at Sacrifices and Teaching), it lasts for four days,
and for him who lives by’two acts,’ it lasts for three days. If, for all
these, the Impurity were to last for ten days, then, as the man would
not be entitled to receive gifts and officiate at sacrifices, his living
would become extremely difficult for him.

Some people hold that—“there are four age-stages, and four periods of
Impurity; so that each of the latter is to be taken along with each of
the former.”

But according to this view, there would be ten days impurity in the case
of the child that has teethed; while in the case of the death of the
initiated boy, it would be for a single day only; and this would be
contrary to usage and other Smṛti-texts.

In order to avoid this incongruity, the connection may be made in the
reverse order; *i.e*., the death of the *initiated* boy entailing *ten*
days, and that of the *tonsured* child four days, the *teething* child
three days, and a still younger child only one day.

Even so in view of the incompatibility (of this view) with the
Smṛti-text, that—‘in the case of the *tonsured* child, the impurity
lasts for three days’,—it would be necessary to regard the two (three
and four days) as optional alternatives; specially as the term ‘*sva*’
refers to ‘three days,’ and the period of^(‘)four days’ would apply to
the particular livelihood of the mourner, or to the particular day on
which the bones are collected. In this manner all this becomes
reconciled with the other Smṛti-texts, which, speaks of^(‘)one day, &c,’
If, on the other hand, the option were explained as based upon the
diversity of age,—then, with what would Menu’s declaration
regarding^(‘)conduct’ and^(‘)study’ be taken as optional?

From all this it follows that on the strength of Gautama’s assertion,
there is to be^(‘)immediate purification,’ only so far as Vedic Study is
concerned—for the man who, like the person possessing a ^(‘)granary’,
has other means of living than the receiving of gifts, and who is very
much learned in the Vedas. In the case of the other alternatives, of
‘three days’ and the rest, the purification in meant simply to qualify
the man for the receiving of gifts for purposes of a living. This is
according to the view of Gautama. If this were not his meaning, then, he
would have said simply—‘for the Brāhmaṇa learning the Veda,’—and not
‘for the purpose of avoiding discontinuance of study.’

Thus, though purification has been laid down in a general way, as to be
accomplished in a single day,—yet it should be understood as pertaining
to certain special acts only. So that the ordinary period for the
Brāhmaṇa being^(‘)ten days’ (according to 5.83), there is no need for
saying anything else; from which it is clear that the option should be
admitted in the manner described above. In the case however of ‘purity’
being immediate, in the case of new born infants, and the period of
impurity lasting for ‘three days’ in the case of tonsured
children,—sinece there is no option, the purity must pertain to all
acts.—(59).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“The commentators are of the opinion that the length of the period of
the impurity depends on the status of the mourner; and that a man who
knows the mantras only of one *Śākhā* shall be impure during four days,
one who knows a whole *Śākhā* (or two Vedas) during three days, one who
knows the Veda (or three Vedas) and keeps three or five sacred fires,
during one day. Medhātithi however mentions another interpretation,
according to which the four periods correspond to the four ages of the
deceased, which have been mentioned in the preceding verse. According to
this view, the Sapiṇḍas shall mourn for an initiated person for ten
days,—for one who had received the tonsure, four days, and so
forth.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 893), which explains the first
half to mean that the *Sapiṇḍas* are impure for ten days, and the second
half as laying down three other alternatives;—‘*Arvāk* (or as it reads
*ā vā*) *sañcayanāt asthnām*’ it explains as indicating the period of
*four days*, the fourth day being prescribed for the collecting of the
bones of the dead. Thus the four alternative periods are—ten days, four
days, three days and one day; and the rule regarding the restriction of
one or the other is thus laid down by *Parāśara*—‘The Brāhmaṇa equipped
with both the Veda and the Fire becomes pure in *one* day, one equipped
with the Veda only in *three* days, and one without qualifications in
ten days.’

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.29), which remarks that the four
periods here specified are meant respectively for the
‘*Kusūladhānyaka*,’ the ‘*Kumbhīdhānyaka*,’ the *Tryahaihika*’ and the
‘*Aśvastanika*’ (described in 4.7 above). It quotes Parāśara’s rule
(just quoted), but rejects it as unacceptable.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 391), and again on p. 426;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (pp. 226 and 229);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 116);—in
*Hāralatā* (p. 3) which reads ‘*āsthi*’ and explains it as meaning ‘four
days’;—and in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 37).

sciences, rituals and esoteric doctrines, and are also devoted to the
performance of religious rites.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘There is no impurity when Vedic Study is carried on,
when Homa is offered at both times and when the Vaiśvadeva-offerings are
constantly made. The Brāhmaṇa equipped with Fire and Veda becomes
purified in one day; those with lesser qualifications, in three and four
days. One without the Fire, in three days; the common Brāhmaṇa, in ten
days; one who lives upon pickings and gleanings is immediately purified;
for one whose sole possession is the *Gāyatrī* and who duly offers the
three twilight-prayers, and who does not live the life of the dog, the
impurity lasts for six days.’

Inasmuch as the present context is meant to provide information
regarding the exact signification of the term ‘*anvaya*’, ‘family’,—and
as the term ‘*bāndhava*’, ‘relation’ (of the proceeding verses) is meant
to be construed with the present text also,—the meaning of the present
verse is that persons born of the same family are called ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’
upto the person in the seventh grade. In view of the assertion—‘the son
shall make offerings to those to whom his fathers make them’.—which lays
down offerings to be made also by a person whose father is living; six
persons become recognised as ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’ (the seventh being the offeror
himself).

Further, according to the statement’—‘offerings are made to forefathers,
counting one’s own self as the seventh’—the grandfather, the
great-grand-father and other ancestors are called ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’; and yet,
while the six ancestors are called ‘*Sapiṇḍas*,’ the six descendants,
beginning with the son, are also called ‘*Sapiṇḍas*,’ Because the
‘offering of the ball’ is a single act, upon which, and in connection
with which, the title ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ becomes applicable,—the ‘son’ and
other descendants also become associated with this ‘act as performed by
the grandson, and other descendants respectively; consequently the
person to whom one makes the offering, and along with whom he becomes
the recipient of the offering—all these come to be called ‘*Sapiṇḍa*;’
and the reason for this lies in the fact that the ‘ball-offering’ is the
only indicative in the present case; just as in the case of the
assertion ‘you should come at conch-time (gun-time)’ the ‘conch’ is the
only indicative of the time that is meant. Thus it comes to this that
all descendants upto the seventh grade of the greatgrandfather of one’s
great-grandfather are his ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’; and similarly the descending
line of one’s descendants, and the descendants of his father,
grand-father and the rest. The degrees are to be counted from that
person from whom the two lines bifurcate. For instance, among persons
who have a common grandfather, the seven degrees should be counted from
that grandfather, and persons falling within those seven degrees would
be the ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’. Similarly in all cases.

In dealing with the question of ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’, all that the text speaks of
is ‘person born of the same family,’ and no mention of the caste is
made; consequently persons belonging to the *Kṣatriya* and other castes
also become ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ of the Brāhmaṇa. It is for this reason that on
the birth of such persons also the Brāhmaṇa remains ‘impure’ for ten
days; while in their own case the period lasts for twelve days (for the
*Kṣatriya*), thirteen for the *Vaiśya* and so forth. Thus then, in the
case of the birth or death of the person of a different caste, or in
that of the *Sapiṇḍa* of a different caste, the purification is governed
by the period prescribed for the caste of the person concerned.

In the case of the Kṣatriya and other castes, their
‘Sapiṇḍa’-relationship to the Brāhmaṇa extends to three degrees only; as
says Śaṅkha—“If of one person there are born several persons, of
different mothers and diverse castes, these are ‘Sapiṇḍas’, with varying
periods of purification; but the ball-offering extends over three
degrees only.” In this passage the term ‘of different mothers’ means
‘*born of mothers of different castes*’; the term ‘of diverse castes’
has also been added in view of the fact that persons born of mothers of
the *same* caste also are ‘born of different mothers’.—These are
‘*Ekapiṇḍa*’, *i.e., Sapiṇḍa*; but ‘with varying periods of
purification’; *i.e*., the purification of each person is in accordance
with his own caste; for instance, for the Brāhmaṇa in the case of the
birth, etc, of his *Sapiṇḍa* of the *Kṣatriya* and other castes, the
purification takes *ten* days; while for the *Kṣatriya*, in the case of
the birth, &c. of his *Brāhmaṇa Sapiṇḍa*, it takes twelve days;—there is
the further peculiarity in this case that ‘the ball-offering extends
over three degrees only’; *i.e*., it is offered to persons within three
degrees only.

Within the pale of their own castes however, for the *Kṣatriya* and
other castes also the ‘Sapiṇḍa-relationship’ extends over seven degrees,
exactly as for Brāhmaṇas; specially as in the words of Śaṅkha justed
quoted, we find the qualifying terms ‘*born* of *one person from
different mothers*’—it is only in relation to other castes that their
‘Sapiṇḍa-relstionship can be understood to extend over three degrees
only. This same fact is still more clearly stated in the following
*Smṛti*—text—‘In the case of impurity due to the death of those
relations of the Brāhmaṇa who are descendants from the *Kṣatriya*, the
*Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*, the purification of the Brāhmaṇa comes after
ten days, upto six, three and one stage respectively.’

In the case of the wives of different castes, if the husband is alive,
the purification is determined by the time laid down for the husband. To
this end it is said—‘In the case of birth and death among slaves, and
among one’s wives of lower castes, the purification would be similar to
that of the master or husband, but if the husband is not living, it
shall be similar to that of their fathers.’

In place of the fist quarter of the text (instead of the words ‘*sūte
mṛte tu dāsānām*—‘in the case of birth and death among slaves’) some
people read ‘*asavarṇāsutānām*’ (‘of sons born of other castes’). If
such be the reading, then such Śūdra-sons as live in the house of the
Brāhmaṇa-father would be controlled entirely by the ways of the father,
and hence their time of purification would be *ten days* in
consideration of their father’s caste.

The term ‘*dāsa*,’ ‘slave’, in the text just quoted are meant to be
those that have been hired; because for born slaves we have another
rule,—viz:—‘Artisans, mechanics, female and male slaves, and king’s
officers have been declared to be capable of immediate purification’.
Bat this ‘purification’ should be understood to consist only in their
touchability, and not as entitling them to the acts of offering gifts,
feeding Brāhmaṇas and so forth; and the reason for this lies in the fact
that all the names here mentioned are such as are based upon
*professions*; which gives rise to the following questions—(*a*) Is the
purification here laid down subversive of all the rules that have been
laid down before?—Or (*b*) does it entitle the man to all acts?—Or (*c*)
does it entitle him to a few of these only? And the conclusion that
suggests itself is that the man is entitled to just those acts that may
be necessary for the proper carrying out of the King’s business. Such
also is the usage.

*Objection.—“in* the present context we do not find any prohibition of
touching \[how then can the text just quoted be taken as pertaining to
*touchability* alone\]?”

But in another *Smṛti-text* we read—‘The touching of the body is
permitted after the bones have been collected;’ and also elsewhere—‘The
Brāhmaṇas become touchable in three or four days; while at birth or
death, purification comes in eleven days; in the case of the *Kṣatriya*
there is touchability on the sixth or seventh day, and their food
becomes pure in twelve days; in the case of the *Vaiśya*, touchability
comes on the eighth or ninth day, but their food is pure in a fortnight;
the *Śūdra* becomes touchable on the eleventh or twelfth day and the
purification of his food comes about in a month.’ So says *Hārīta*; and
yet another text also—‘The touchability of the different castes comes
about in three, four, five and six days respectively; the food of the
Brāhmaṇa becomes eatable in ten days, and that of the other castes two,
three and six days later’.

The several alternatives mentioned in the above texts are he taken as
based upon the exigencies of individual cases, as also upon the higher
or lower qualifications of the persons concerned; *e.g*. the hired
slaves of the Brāhmaṇa remain untouchable for time or four days,
while-their born slaves become touchable immediately. Similarly, in the
case of the other cutes also.

Wherever ‘immediate purification’ is mentioned, them should be bathing
with all the clothes on.

As regards the purification of material substances,—all details are
going to be explained later on.

Among girls also, the ‘*Sapiṇḍa-relationship*’ extends to three degrees.
As says Vaśiṣṭha—‘For women who have got sons it is known to extend to
three degrees.’ This limited ‘*sapiṇḍa-* relationship’ in the case of
women however refers only to Impurity; as regards *marriage* what its
extent should be has been already indicated before.

The final conclusion thus is that the seventh degree is the limit, and
the persona up to and including the sixth degree are ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’. This
is what is meant by the words—‘*it ceases with the person in the seventh
deree* (*decree*?).’

‘*The Samānodaka*’ *relationship*—*i.e. the name*
^(‘)*Samānodaka*’—‘*when the origin and the name become
unrecognisable*.’—‘Origin’—‘such a person is born in my own
family’;—‘*name*’—‘he is descended from the father named so and so, and
the grandfather named so *&*; so’;—when both these are
‘*unrecognisable*.’ That is, when either of these happens to be unknown,
then also, the name in question is not applicable.

In the case of persons within the limits of ‘Samānodaka-relationship,’
all that people should do is to enter a river or some other
water-reservoir, till the water reaches up to the navel,—they should
face the south and, having offered water with the right hand upward,
without looking back, should return home.—(60)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 893), as providing the
definition of the ‘*Samānodaka*’ relationship, and explains the meaning
to be that this relationship subsists among all those people who clearly
recognise a common ancestor;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.253);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 590);—in *Vyāvahāramayūkha* (p. 63) which,
construes ‘*Saptame*’ as ‘*Saptame atīte*,’ so that the seventh also
becomes included in ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ relationship;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
427);—in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 37), which says that ‘*vinivartate*’ is to
be construed with the second line also;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 230),
which says that from the point where ‘*Samānodaka*’ relationship ceases,
‘*Sagotra*’ relationship alone remains;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 104),
which quotes Medhātithi to the effect that all those who are descended
from the great-grandfather of one’s own great-grandfather are his
‘Sapiṇḍas’;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 96), which has the following note:—Six
ancestors beginning from one’s father are *his* ‘Sapiṇḍa,’ the seventh
ancestor is not ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’; and the reason for this lies in the fact
that one’s three immediate ancestors—father, grandfather and
great-grandfather—are entitled to receive the ‘piṇḍa’ from him, and the
next three ancestors—*i*. *e*., the father, grandfather and
great-grandfather of the great-grandfather,—are entitled to the
‘smearings of his piṇḍa;’ while the seventh ancestor is not entitled to
any share of *Piṇḍa*; it adds that the man himself is ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ of his
own six ancestors;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 52), which explains that the
‘Sapiṇḍā’ relationship ceases in one’s *seventh* ancestor, and
‘*Samānodaka*’ relationship extends upto that person who is known to be
descended from ‘my such and such ancestor,’ and from the point where no
such descent can be specifically pointed out, that relationship ceases
and beyond that all are ‘*gotraja*’ only;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla,
p. 256), which reproduces Medhātithi’s remark quoted above;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 181);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
209b).

*Viṣṇu* (22.5).—‘Sapiṇḍa-relationship ceases at the seventh degree.’

*Parāśara* (1.3.8).—‘In the case of descendants of a different caste,
the Sapiṇḍa-relationship (and the consequent impurity) ceases with the
fourth degree; one’s descendant in the fifth degree, becomes excluded
from the Sapiṇḍa-relationship.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 589).—‘Those beginning with the
fourth ancestor, are *Partakers of the Smearing*; those beginning with
the father, are *Partakers of the Balls*; the offerer of the hall
himself is the seventh; thus does Sapiṇḍa-relationship extend over seven
degrees.’

*Paiṭhīnasī* (Do., p. 590).—‘The Sapiṇḍa-relationship ceases beyond
three from the mother and five from the father.’

*Vṛddha-Parāśara* (Do., p. 589).—‘Sapiṇḍa-relationship ceases with the
seventh degree, in the case of their being all of the same caste; in the
ease of their being of different castes, it ceases with the fourth
degree.’

The same rule holds good regarding ‘*birth*’ among *Sapiṇḍas*. Just as
in connection with death several alternative periods of impurity have
been laid doom, in consideration of one’s livelihood depending upon the
six acts (of giving and receiving gifts and so forth), and also upon the
vastness or purity of one’s Vedic learning,—exactly the same holds good
regarding cases of birth also; all that is meant to be applicable to the
case of birth is *impurity* pure and simple, without any qualification
of time; so that no specifications being found to be indicated here, the
case of birth, through its own inherent aptitude, becomes connected with
all that has been said (in the way of qualifications and limitations) in
connection with *death*. On the other hand, if the words of the text
were taken to indicate the application, to the case of birth, of
impurity as specially limited by a particular period of time, then it
would be connected only with the period of ten days, which is the
principal alternative laid down; and in that case this same period would
apply to the case of Vedic Study &c. also. Or, by the closer proximity
of the mention of the alternative of the single-day-period, the case of
birth would become connected with this latter period only; and thus
having its wants supplied by this, it would have no connection with the
other alternative periods of ‘three days’ and the rest. And in that
case, even in the face of the limitations and restrictions due to
livelihood and study, the present text would lay down the same single
alternative in connection with both death and birth, and would,
irrespective of all qualifications of the persons concerned, become
conditioned by their caste only, and thus become incongruous and opposed
to usage.

“Under this explanation, the alternative periods of *three days* and the
rest would become applicable also to the women that have been delivered;
and this would be contrary to all usage.”

The answer to this is as follows:—This would be the case only if what is
laid down in the present verse (regarding the delivered woman) were an
optional alternative. As a matter of fact however, the rule laid down is
absolutely fixed. It is only thus that the use of the term *tu* “*but*”
becomes justified.

Then again, the term ‘*sūtaka*’ used in the text does not directly
denote *impurity*; it could only indirectly *indicate* the *impurity as
related to parturition* (which is what is directly express sed by the
word). But through indirect indication it would be far more reasonable
to make it express *untouchability*, which is more nearly related to
parturition. If all kinds of impurity were meant, then the author would
have used the word ‘*āśauca*’ ‘impurity’, itself; and the line would
have read ‘*āśaucam mātureva syāt*.’ From all this it follows that
another *Smṛti-text* having laid down three days (for both parents), and
the present text making no mention of any such period, what is here said
regarding the ‘parturient disabiliy’ attaching ‘to the mother only’ is
an optional alternative. So that between the father and the mother the
option applies to the father only.

The father becomes pure after having bathed. This is only by way of a
piefatory (prefatory?) statement; from what follows in the next verse
the father also remains untouchable for *three days*. (61).

Medhātithi and Govindarāja omit the first line of 61 and the first line
of 62; so that in the place of 61 and 62, they read only one verse made
up of the second lines of both 61 and 62.

This verse is quoted in *Hāralāta*, (p. 15), which explains ‘*evameva*’
as standing for ‘ten days’ and other periods;—and in *Śuddhimayūkha*,
(p. 37).

*Gautama* (14.14).—‘The rules regarding impurity caused by death of a
relation are applicable to that caused by the birth of a child also;—in
this case, the impurity falls on the parents,—or on the mother alone.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.1).—‘Referring to births and deaths, they declare
that the impurity of Sapiṇḍas lasts ten days.’

Do. (1.11. 19-23).—‘On a birth indeed, the parents become impure for ten
days; some declare that the mother alone becomes impure, because people
avoid only lying-inwomen; others say that the father alone becomes
impure, because the semen is the chief cause, the Veda speaking of sons
born without mothers. Hut the correct opinion is that both the parents
become impure, because they are equally connected with the event.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.20-22).—‘The rule regarding impurity should bo exactly the
same on the birth of a child, for those men who desire complete
purity,—or for the mother and the father alone; according to some for
the mother only; they quote the following text:—“On the birth of a
child, the male does not become impure, if he does not touch the
female.”’

*Parāśara* (3.31).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.10).—‘The impurity (on birth) attaches to the parents;
but most certainly and completely to the mother. On the day of the birth
however there is no impurity; since on that day the ancestors are born.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 896).—There is no impurity for the male, if he
has no contact with the female.’

While laying down purification after three days, the author permits the
purification by bathing, which has been spoken of above. If it be
asked—“why should this be stated?”—the answer is that it is stated in
the form an injunction; by way of a commendatory assertion, and not a
regular injunction, just as in the case of the Vedic passage
‘*jartilayavāgvā va juhuyāt*

‘*Having thrown out semen*’,—after emission daring the act of sexual
intercourse,—the man becomes pure by bathing.

‘*Hence, on account of seminal filiation*’;—‘*Seminal*’ means
*pertaining to the semen*;—*fitiliation* means *begetting of the child*;
and in the event of this, why should he not ‘*observe*’— keep up—‘*the
impurity for three days*.’ The impurity due to child-birth is not of the
same kind as that which attaches to the man who has emitted semen and
has not taken a bath; in fact it lasts for three days. The period of
‘three days’ mentioned here is a reiteration of the same as occurring in
the preceding verse. For this same reason the ‘*upaspṛśya*’ in the
present verse is taken to mean *bathing* and not merely *water-sipping*;
specially in view of the assertion that ‘*s??na*, ‘birthing,’ has been
enjoined for the man who has had *sexual* intercourse.

Some people hold that when a son is born to a man, he becomes touchable
on that same day. As says Śaṅkha—At the birth of a boy, before the
placenta has been severed, there is nothing wrong in the man receiving,
on that same day, the gift of sugar, sesamum, gold, cloth, clothes, cows
and grain,—so say some: and again—‘for this reason that day is sacred,
enhancing as it does the pleasure of the forefathers: and because it
reminds one of his ancestors, there is no impurity attaching to that
day.’ In fact some people-even go to the length of performing *śrāddhas*
on that day. From this it follows that in such cases there is no
impurity attaching to the father at all.

In fact the two *Smṛti-* texts just quoted are to be taken as providing
optional alternatives, in consideration of the man having, or not
having, means of living (other than the receiving of gifts).—(62).

(Verse 63 of other commentators.)

According to the interpretation of Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda, the two halves of this verse are distinct, the first half
laying down that the man who emits semen is purified by bathing, and the
second half that he who begets a child is purified after three days.
According to Medhātithi however, the first half supplies the reason for
what is asserted in the second half. (See *Translation*).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 606), which
explains ‘*baijika-sambandha*’ as ‘*janyajanakabhāva*,’ ‘the parental
relationship.’

The *Hāralatā*, which has both lines of (62) explains the meaning
as—‘The untouchability due to death pertains to all *sapiṇḍas*, and that
due to birth pertains to the parents of the child only, but the full
period (ten days) of ‘impurity’ attaches to the mother only, that
attaching to the father disappears immediately on bathing.

‘*Three three-day periods*’— *i.e*., nine days;—along with one day and
one night,—make up *ten days*. The period has been mentioned in this
fashion in view of metrical exigencies.

‘*Those who touch the corpse*’—*i.e*., those who wash and adorn the dead
body. Mere bathing is going to be laid down later on, for the other
persons touching the body, as also for those who carry it; as will be
made dear from the next verse.

All this refers to the *Samānodaka* relations as also to those who carry
the body for wages received. In regard to the carrying of the dead of
helpless and forlorn persons, we have another *Smṛti*—text, which
says—‘For such persons who do the excellent deed (of carrying the dead
body of a helpless man), there is nothing wrong, nor is there any
impurity involved, for them it has been ordained that they are
immediately purified by bathing in water.’ As regards the assertion of
the text under 5.100—‘He who carries the dead body of a Brāhmaṇa, who is
not his Sapiṇḍa-relation, becomes purified in three days’—what this
means we shall explain under that verse.

‘*Those who offer water*’— *i.e*., the ‘*Samānodaka*’ relations. In
connection with these, ‘immediate purification’ also is going to be laid
down under verse 77. Hence the two should be regarded as optional
alternatives.

What is said here is in connection with ‘sapiṇḍa’ relations and refers
to persons not engaged in Vedic study.—(63)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 64 of other commentators.)

“According to Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, the rule refers to such
Brāhmaṇas who for money carry a dead body to the cemetery according to
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, to Sapiṇḍas who in any way touch a corpse out
of affection;—Medhātithi thinks that it applies to all who touch or cany
out a dead body, be it for love or for money. Rāghavānanda thinks that
the text mentions three alternative periods of impurity, one day, three
days and ten days.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 883), which explains it as
laying down the period of impurity of ten days for those who touch a
dead body; it explains ‘*ahnā chaikena rātryā*’ as meaning ‘one day and
night,’ and ‘*tribhiḥ trirātraiḥ*’ as ‘nine days’;—thus ten days is the
period of impurity (for the Brāhmaṇa) touching the dead body of the
Brāhmaṇa; for the Brāhmaṇa carrying for money the dead body of other
castes, the period extends to that which has been prescribed for that
caste—says the *Viṣṇupurāṇa*;—*Aparārka* quotes the verse again on p.
893 to the effect that the period of impurity, for *Samānodakas* is only
three days.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 382), which also explains it as
laying down a period of ten days.

*Gautama* (14.23.10, 27).—‘On touching a corpse from an interested
motive, the impurity lasts for ten days. The duration of the impurity of
a Vaiśya and of a Śūdra (in the same case), twelve days, or half a
month, or a whole month, or as many days as there are seasons in the
year: The same rule applies to the higher castes. Or the impurity-lasts
three days.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.11).—‘For those who have touched a corpse as a duty,
and who desire immediate purification, such purification is accomplished
by Bathing and Breath-control.’

*Parāśara* (Mitākṣara, 3, 14).—‘Those twice-born persons who carry the
dead body of a Brāhmaṇa become purified immediately by bathing.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 883).—‘If a man, on payment, burns the dead
body of a person of a different caste from himself, the period of his
impurity will be the same as that prescribed for the caste of the dead.’

*Parāśara* (Aparārka, p. 883).—‘The Brāhmaṇa is not defiled by touching
or cremating a dead body: if he carries it and applies fire to it, he
becomes purified immediately by bathing.’

village till the stars become visible; and at night, till the appearance

In the case of miscarriage, the purification, that comes after as many
days as the months of pregnancy, can pertain only to the woman: us it is
the *woman* that is directly spoken of in the verse. The rule for the
purification, in this case, of her Sapiṇḍa-relation has to be sought
from other *Smṛtis* and from usage. Vaśiṣṭha (4. 34) however has laid
down the period of *three days* for all Sapiṇḍas—‘In the case of the
death of a child less than two years old, and also in the case of
miscarriage, the impurity lasts for three days.’

It is regarded as a case of ‘miscarriage,’ when it happens after three
months and before the tenth month; others hold that it is to be so
regarded when it happens before the ninth month. What is called
‘*srāva*’ (*lit*. *flowing out*) here is *discharge* *before the right*
*time*, and not necessarily the *flowing* *out* of a liquid substance.

In connection with miscarriage, Gautama also has declared that ‘the
period lasts for as many days as there have been months’ (14-15).

As a matter of fact, children born in the seventh month live; hence if
miscarriage takes place in the seventh month, the period of impurity is
full (ten days). But this is so only if the child is born alive;
otherwise it is to be as many days as there have been months.

For the woman in her courses it has been ordained that she is purified
by bathing after the flow has ceased; while another Smṛti text says that
she becomes pure in *three days*. On this point the final conclusion is
as follows: ‘Before three days, even though the flow may cease, she is
not pure; while after three days she becomes pure even though the flow
may not have ceased.’ In the text however, though the term used first is
‘becomes pure’, we find word ‘*fit*’ (*sādhvī*) used in connection with
the menstruating woman; and this means that so long as the flow has not
ceased, she is not *fit* for participating in the Vedic rites; and it
does not mean that she is *untouchable*; as it has been declared that
‘the first four days have been condemned.’ The construction thus is—‘The
woman in her courses, on the ceasing of the flow, by bathing, becomes
fit’—*i.e*., fit for participating in religious rites.

The term ‘woman’ has been used with a view to include women of all
castes; the foregoing verses having been explained as applying to the
Brāhmaṇa. The text has used the term ‘woman’ in this verse with a view
to guard against the idea that what is here laid down also applies to
the Brāhmaṇa only. In the following verses also, where there is nothing
to indicate the restriction of a rule to any particular caste, it is to
be understood as applying to all castes; as for instance, the next verse
which speaks of ‘persons whose tonsure has not been performed.’—(65).

(Verse 66 of other commentators.)

“Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda think that this rule refers to miscarriages
which happen during the first six months of pregnancy; and that from the
seventh month, whether the child lives or not, the full period of
impurity must he kept. Nārāyaṇa moreover asserts that in the first and
second months the impurity shall last three
days”.—Buhler.—‘*Sādhvī*’.—‘Becomes pure’ (Medhātithi and
Kullūka);—‘chaste’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.20), which explains the second
half to mean as follows:—‘The woman in her courses becomes pure—*i.e*.,
fit for religious functions—on bathing *after the cessation of the
menstrual flow*; but as regards touchability, she becomes fit for it by
bathing on the fourth day, even though the flow may not have ceased
entirely.

The verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 369);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(p. 3);—in *Hāralatā* (p. 68), which says that, the plural number in
‘*rātribhiḥ*’ indicates that miscarriage is a source of purity only when
it occurs in the third and subsequent months of the pregnancy, and that
the mention of the ‘woman’ in the second line makes it clear that the
impurity due to miscarriage also attaches to the wife only, and not to
the husband;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 25a).

*Gautama* (14.17-18).—‘For miscarriage the impurity lasts for a number
of days, equal to the number of months from conception;—or for three
days.’

*Baudhāyana*, (1.11.31).—‘On miscarriage, the female remains impure for
as many days as months that may have elapsed since conception.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.72).—‘The woman in her courses becomes pure by bathing, on
the fourth day.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.20).—‘On miscarriage, purification is brought about by
the lapse of as many nights as the months (that may have elapsed since
conception).’

*Ādipurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 901).—‘If there is miscarriage within six
months of conception, then purification is brought about by the lapse of
days equal in number to that of the months; after six months the
purification follows the ordinary rule of the caste. For the *Sapiṇḍas*,
the purification is immediate.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 901).—‘On the death of a child less than two
years old and on miscarriage, the *Sapiṇḍas* are impure for three days.’

*Marīci* (Aparārka, p. 901).—‘On miscarriage, for the Brāhmaṇa, the
impurity lasts three days; for the Kṣatriya, four days; for the Vaiśya,
five days, and for the Śūdra eight days. On miscarriage, the mother
herself remains impure in accordance with the number of months, while
the father and others remain impure for three days.’

*Vṛddha-Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 901).—‘On miscarriage, the woman herself
is impure for as many days as the number of months; the man is purified
by simple bathing; but after three days if the pregnancy had advanced.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Aparārka, p. 901).—‘Till the fourth month the miscarriage
is called “*Srāva*,” *Flowing out*; during the fifth and sixth months,
it is called “*Pāta*” *Falling out*; after that it is “*Prasūti*,”
*child-birth*; and the impurity due to this last lasts for four days.’

The genetive endings in this verse some people explain as having the
sense of the Nominative, according to Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* 3,3,83; and in
that case the meaning would be—‘the person whose tonsure has not been
performed is purified in one day;’ and it has already been explained
that some options in this connection are also based upon the age and
condition of the person observing the impurity; and the present verse
lays down specific rules in accordance with the general principle there
enunciated.

Others, however, explain the genetive ending as denoting relationship;
and in this case they have to supply some words; the meaning
being—^(‘)the Sapiṇḍa relation of persons whose tonsure has not been
performed etc;, etc.?’

This latter view is what is in keeping with usage.

Another Smṛti text has declared immediate purification; and the same
text has laid down the exact scope of that rule—^(‘)Till the appearance
of teeth, it is immediate: till the performance of the Tonsure, it comes
after one day; and in the case of those whose Tonsure has been
performed, it lasts for three days.’—(66)

*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which remarks that the second half of the

Medhātithi offers two constructions:—(1) By one the verse is made to

only; till tonsure, for one night; till initiation, three nights; after

dying before teething, the purification is immediate; after tonsure, in
one day; before initiation, its relations become purified in three days.
Before the naming ceremony, it is immediate.’

teething, the impurity due to their death lasts three days.’

*Kaśyapa* (Aparārka, p. 910).—‘In the case of children dying before

impurity lasts one night; on that of a Kṣatriya, three days; of a
Vaiśya, three days.

......In the case of the Brāhmaṇa dying after tonsure, the impurity
lasts for three days; of the Kṣattnya, six days; of the Vaiśya, nine

six, nine and twelve days respectively.’

impurity lasts for three days in the case of the death of the boy, and

The child whose sacramental rites have not been performed, and since
whose birth less than two years have elapsed, is called ‘*less than two
years old*’. Such a child, when it dies, ‘*the relations should place
outside*’—the village —‘*under the ground*,’ that has been dug out.

Another *Smṛti* -text contains the word ‘*nikhavet* (?)’. should bury’.

‘*Having decked*’—with ornaments befitting the dead. The ‘*decking*’,
mentioned here in connection with the child ‘few *than two years old*’,
should be understood, on the strength of usage, to apply to those also
whose sacramental rites have been performed.

‘*Clean*’—where there are no bones. That is, the ground that is clean by
reason of the absence of heaps of bones,—under such a ground should the
child he placed. As a rule, the crematorium abounds in heaps of bones;
hence what the present text means is that the child should be buried in
a place other than the crematorium; and it does not mean that in this
case the rite of ‘bone-collecting’ shall not be performed: because this
later fact is already implied by the absence of burning in the
case.—(67)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 68 of other commentators.)

‘*Asthisañcayanādṛte*’—‘Place free from bones’ (Medhātithi, also
Mitākṣarā);—‘without the rite of bonecollecting’ (Kullūka, who quotes
Viśvarupa’s explanation which agrees with Medhātithi’s).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which says that this
refers to the case of the death of a child who has had his tonsure
performed during the first year;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.2) which explains
the meaning to be that ‘the child should be decked with garlands and
sandal-paint and should be buried in a clean place, away from the
burning grounds, hut outside the village,—which should he free from
bones.

It is quoted in *Hāralatā* (p. 121), which has the following
notes:—‘*ūnadvivārṣikam*’, one whose tonsure has not been performed
,—‘*alaṅkṛtya*’, having endowed the dead body with rings, clothes,
flowers, garlands and so forth, they should bury it in some pure spot
outside the village; and even though the body would soon become
decomposed and hence the rite of *picking of the, bones* might he
possible, it should not be done.

‘*Like a log of wood*;’—this signifies absence of attachment,
indifference.

The morning is that in thin case no *Śrāddha*, nor any water, is to be
offered; the prohibition of ‘water-offering’ implying that of the
*Śrāddha* also, through the relation of whole and part. It is thus that
we have to get at the omission of *Śrāddha*, which is in accordance with
usage.

Others explain this to mean the prohibition of burial laid down in other
*Smṛti* -texts. And in this case there would be option.

‘*Keep aloof*’—abstain from all religious acts prescribed in the
scriptures.—(68)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.2), which explains ‘*araṇye

they should take no further notice of him, in the way of performing his
*Śrāddha* and other after-death rites.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 870), which explains the meaning to he
that, the child less than two years old, *which has not had its
Tonsure*, should be either buried or thrown into the water, without any
after-death rites;—and again on p. 911, where it is said that the
digging &c. are meant for the child who has had his Tonsure done during
the first year. It is difficult to reconcile the two statements.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which also says that, these
two verses refer to the case of the child who has had his Tonsure
performed during the first year;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 122), which
explains ‘*araṇye*,’ ‘in forest,’ as meaning in ‘uncultivated ground,’

‘*Like a log of wood*;’—this signifies absence of attachment,
indifference.

The morning is that in thin case no *Śrāddha*, nor any water, is to be
offered; the prohibition of ‘water-offering’ implying that of the
*Śrāddha* also, through the relation of whole and part. It is thus that
we have to get at the omission of *Śrāddha*, which is in accordance with
usage.

Others explain this to mean the prohibition of burial laid down in other
*Smṛti* -texts. And in this case there would be option.

‘*Keep aloof*’—abstain from all religious acts prescribed in the
scriptures.—(68)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Upto three years of age*’;—this prohibition applies till the end of
the third year; and not from the fourth year upwards. It is in this
sense that some people read an ‘*ādi*’, the line being read
as—‘*trivarṣādeva kartavyā*’. Such also is the ordinary usage.

‘*For one whose teeth had appeared it may be done optionally*.’—By
association with the ‘water-offering’, *burning by fire* also becomes
permitted.

Objection—“When there is *option*, one may do what he likes; under the
circumstances, who would ever have recourse to that alternative which
involves much effort and expenditure of wealth? Thus then, the laying
down of such a course of action is absolutely useless.”

The answer to this is as follows:—What is mentioned here is for the
parents, as distinguished from all other persons; the offerings that are
made are for the benefit of the deceased; and bring of the nature of an
‘occasional duty,’ it is one that must be done, as we have explained
before. So that the option mentioned in the present verse is dearly
understood as containing, on the one hand, the prohibition of a
necessary duty; while, on the other, it permits its performance on the
ground of its being beneficial to the deceased. So that if one omits the
act, it does not involve the transgression of an injunction: while by
performing it, one confers a benefit upon the deceased; so that there is
no incompatibility between the Injunction and the Prohibition.—(69)

‘*Whose sacramentary rite has been performed*;’—*i.e*, those who have
been accepted verbally, but have not been actually married; at the death
of such women, their^(‘)*marital relations*’—on her husband’s side, &c.,
&c.

‘*Their paternal relations*’—on the father’s side—are
purified^(‘)*according to the rule prescribed before*’—in verse 66;
*i.e*., in three days; this rule being laid down with reference to a
particular caste.

Others have explained the second half as referring to the rule that
‘uterine brothers and sisters are purified in ten days’ (the word
‘*sanābhi*’ being taken to mean ‘uterine’). The view of these persons is
as follows:—It has been laid down that a girl should be given away in
her eighth year: so that one who has teen given away is not. spoken of
as ‘one whose tonsure has teen performed’,—just as the ‘initiated boy’
is not so spoken of; and in as much as no other rule has been laid down,
the only right course to adopt is to observe the impurity tor *ten
days*.

Others again have read (the second half) as—^(‘)*ahastvadatta-kanyāsu
bālāsu ca vishodhanam*’; and people have explained this to mean that,
even in the case of a girl that remains unmarried till she is nearly
fifteen years old, the impurity shall last for one day only; and this on
the ground that there is no justification for rejecting the direct
injunction and observing a longer period of impurity.

Our answer to this is as follows:—What is the use of the expression
‘*bālāsu ca*’, when it has been already asserted that^(‘)upto the
appearance of teeth, the purity is immediate’? It is not right to have
this assertion set aside by the present later declaration: because the
present declaration is a general one, while the former is more
specialised. Hence the ‘one day’ rule, even though laid down, can only
be taken as referring to children till the performance of their Tonsure;
specially as a general statement is always dependent upon (and
controlled by) particular ones. For these reasons the suggested reading
of the second half of the verse must be rejected as not. emanating from
the sage. But it may be taken as refering to *touchability*. There is
un-touchability due to the birth or death of a child, exactly as in the
case of grown up men; and it is only with reference to this that there
could be the assertion that—^(‘)there is purity (*i.e*., touch-ability)
after one day in the case of unmarried girls and young children,
(*i.e*., these become touchable in one day)’; and it is in this sense
that the Locative ending (in ‘*bālāsu*’ and ‘*kanyāsu*’) be comes
justified as being the correct one: since it is a regular case-ending.
If the words were taken in any other sense (*e.g*., as meaning^(‘)at the
death of girls and hoys, &c.’), it would be necessary to have elliptical
construction and to take the Locative ending in the^(‘)absolute’
sense:—‘girls and hoys having died, the purity of those living comes
about after one day’; and we could not get at the sense that the
impurity spoken of results from the touching of the dead; specially as
the former (the seme obtained by construing the line as Locative
Absolute) has its sphere of application elsewhere, in the ease of burial
under-ground; and no *touching* is possible in the case of the body
being placed under the ground.

“Since the assertion is a general one, wherefore is it restricted to a
particular case.’”?.

As a matter of fact, we find a rule regarding the *sipping of water* in
the same connection; and in connection with this, it is only the said
kind of *hatch* that is possible. It is for this reason that people do
not consider it desirable to touch the child that has touched a
menstruating woman; and this may be regarded as the qualifying factor in
the present case; is has been declared by Gautama in his Smṛti; it is
only right for such a person to set up the fire; hence it is only right
that it should be taken as pointing to the time of setting up the
fire.—(71).

(Verse 72 of other commentators.)

‘*Yathoktena kalpena*’—‘According to the rule declared in verse 67’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Nandana);—‘just like the husband’s
relatives, *i.e*., after three days’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 907), which supplies the
following explanation:—In the case of ‘*asaṃskṛta*’—*i.e*.,
unmarried—women, the ‘*bāndhavas*’—*i.e*., their relations on the
husband’s side—become pure in three days; but their *sanābhayaḥ*—*i.e*.,
relations on the father’s side—become pure according to the aforesaid
rule. It is because the relations on the father’s side are separately
mentioned by means of the word ‘*sanābhayaḥ*’ that the generic term
‘*bāndhavāḥ*’ is taken in the special sense of ‘relations on the
husband’s side’. But there can be no such relations in the case of
*unmarried* women; hence the women meant here must be those that have
been verbally betrothed, but not yet formally married.—‘*Sanābhayaḥ*,’
the relations on the father’s side, are purified according to the rule
that has been laid down in connection with the death of a boy before
*Upanayana*,—*i.e*., the impurity ceases after three days. The analogy
between the two cases is based upon the principle that for women
‘marriage’ takes the place of the *Upanayana*; so that the *unmarried
girl* stands on the same footing as the *uninitiated boy*.

The verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.24), to the effect that in the
case of girls who have been betrothed, but not married, the relations on
the father’s side are purified in three days. Here also ‘*bāndhava*’ and
‘*sanābhi*’ are explained as in *Aparārka*; and it is added that the
‘ten-days’ rule could not be rightly applied before marriage.’

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 608), in the same sense,
and ‘*bāndhavāḥ*’ is explained as *patisapiṇḍāḥ*, and ‘*sanābhayaḥ*’ as
‘*pitṛsapiṇḍāḥ*’,—and *yathoktena kalpena* as the ‘three days’ rule’.

It is also quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 264) in the sense that in the
case of girls that have been betrothed, but whose marriage-rites have
not been. performed, the *sapiṇḍas* of her husband are purified in three
days, while the *sapiṇḍas* of her father are purified by the said rule,
*i.e*., by the rule declared in the first half of the verse. It adds
that ‘betrothal’ must be a necessary condition, as before that the
unmarried girl win have no relations ‘on the husband’s side’; and that
her father’s *sapiṇḍas* to only three degrees are meant, because of the
express declaration of Vaśiṣṭha that ‘for unmarried girls the
*sapiṇḍa-relationship* extends to only three degrees.’

This is quoted in *Hāralatā* (p. 49), whieh adds the following
notes:—‘*Asaṃskṛtānām*,’ unmarried,—‘*bāndhavāḥ*’ relations on the
husband’s side—‘*yathoktena*,’ as described in the first line of the
verse, *i.e*., they are purified in three days;—the first half refers to
the girl dying after betrothal, as before betrothal, the girl can have
no ‘relations on the husband’s side’; her ‘*sanābhayaḥ*,’ *i.e*.,
relations on her father’s side, also become pure in three days.

‘*Salines and salts*.’—The term^(‘)*salines*’ stands for nitrate of
potash and such substances, and^(‘)*salts*’ for rock-salt and other
salts. These they should not eat.

Or, the term ‘*saline*’, ‘*kṣāra*’, may be taken as qualifying,
‘*lavaṇa*’, ‘salt.’ In that case the prohibition (applying to only
*saline salts*) would not apply to rock-salt.

The ‘bathing’ laid down is to be done in a river or a tank or such other
reservoirs of water as are not regarded as specially ‘sacred’; and it is
to be done without scrubbing the body.

‘*Meat-food*’—is prohibited during the period of impurity, on the basis
of other *Smṛti* texts; where we read—‘They shall not have recourse to
women, they shall not scrub their body and they shall not eat meat.’ The
*Gṛhyasūtra* however says—‘For three days they shall remain without
food, or still live upon food obtained by purchase.’

‘*Should sleep*’—upon the bare platform, without company.

Another Smṛti-text has prescribed abstention from sexual intercourse
during impurity due to *births* also.—(72).

*Viṣṇu* (23.39-41).—‘Living in a foreign land, if one hears of a birth
or a death, his impurity lasts dining those days that may remain of the
prescribed period of impurity; if he hears of it just after the lapse of
the prescribed period of impurity, and before the lapse of one year, he
becomes pure in one night;—after that by bathing.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.21).—‘In the ease of one dying in a foreign land, the
impurity lasts during the remaining days of the period; if no days
remain, then during three days; if one year has elapsed, one becomes
pure by offering water to the dead.’

*Pāraskara Gṛhyasūtra* (3, 10.44-45).—‘If one dies while absent on a
journey, his relations shall sit on the ground from the time that they
have heard of the death, offering water until the period of impurity has
elapsed. If that period has already elapsed, then through one night, or
three nights.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.35).—‘If a person dies in a foreign country, and his
*Sapiṇḍas* hear of his death after ten days, the impurity lasts for one
day and night.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 904).—‘If the death of a relative in foreign
lands is heard of within three fortnights, the impurity lasts three
days; up to six months, for one night and the days preceding and
following it; up to a year, for one day; after that one becomes pure by
bathing.’

*Viṣṇu* (Do.).—‘If it is heard of before the lapse of three fortnights,
the impurity lasts three days; before six months, for a day and night;
before one year, one day,—in the case of a man dying in foreign lands.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.).—‘The son, even though he be living in distant lands,
on hearing of the death of his parents, shall remain impure for ten days
beginning from the day on which he hears of it.’

*Gautama* (14.44).—‘If infants living in a distant country, or a
renunciate, or a n on- *Sapiṇḍa* die, the purification is
instantaneous.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.36).—‘Gautama declares that if a person who has kindled
the sacred fires dies on a journey, his *Sapiṇḍas* shall again celebrate
his obsequies and remain impure for ten days.’

*Parāśara* (3.10).—‘If one hears of the death of a *Sagotra* in a
foreign land, he is not impure either for one day or for three days; he
becomes purified immediately by bathing.’

‘*Foreign country*,’—means *another village*, &c., as before.

‘*Vigatam*’—dead.

‘*Within ten days*’.—This is only by way of illustration: what is meant
is the period of impurity that has been prescribed in each case;—the
remainder of that period would be the period to be observed in the
special case mentioned. The repeated mention of ‘*ten days*’ is for the
purpose of filling up the metre.

The period of impurity due to birth and death is determined by their
origin; so that the periods of ‘ten days’ and the rest are to be counted
from the day on which the birth or the death may have taken place, and
not from the day on which it may become known to the relations. As a
result of this, if the guest happen to know of the birth, &c., having
occurred in the house, he should not take his food in that house, even
though the master of that house himself may still be ignorant of it.
Thus in both cases (of death and birth) the counting is to be done from
the day of origination.

Thus those who are subject to impurity for ‘ten days’ shall remain
impure for the remainder of that period; and for those who are subject
to a period of ‘three days’, purification is obtained immediately, by
bathing along with all the clothing that may be on them.—(74).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 75 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 385), in support of the view
that if one cause of impurity should happen during the period of
impurity due to another cause, then the former should be regarded as
over by the end of the latter.

*Videśa* or *Deśāntara* is thus defined by ‘Vṛddha-Manu’ quoted in
*Aparārka* (p. 905):—‘That which is interposed by a great river (a river
falling directly into the sea) or by a mountain, or where the language
is different.’

It is quoted in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 70);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
232), which explains ‘*vigatam*’ as ‘dead’ and adds that this rule
applies to cases of *birth* also, and that ‘ten days’ stands for the
full period of impurity under normal conditions;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p.
36);—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 32) which has the following
notes:—‘*videśastham*’ in another country, *i.e*., from where the news
of death cannot come quickly,—‘*anirdaśam*,’ before the end of ten days.

In regard to ‘*videśa*’, *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 71) quotes Rudradhara
as saying that even though there be no intervening mountains or rivers,
if the distance between two countries is more than 60 *yojanas*—*e.g*.,
Tirhut and Prayāga,—they are ‘*videśa*’ to each other, but not so
between Tirhut and Kaśi, the distance between which is only 30
*yojanas*.

In cases where the period of impurity ordained lasts for ten days or

one day, or less,—if this period has elapsed, one has simply to bathe
along with his clothes: as is going to be laid down later—(Verse 77.)

‘*When a year has elapsed*’—one becomes pure ‘*by touching
water*’,—*i.e*., by bathing. From what has been said elsewhere regarding
‘touching water with the hands and feet &c.’, it is clear that the whole

Here also the mention of ‘ten days’ is meant to stand for the period of
impurity ordained in each individual case. The meaning thus is
that—‘before the expiry of the period of impurity ordained for a
particular ease, if another cause of impurity should come about, then
purification comes with the lapse of the remainder of that period; and
the second period of impurity is not to be counted from the day on which
the cause shall have arisen.’ Says Gautama (14.5)—‘If an impurity should
occur again during the interval, the purification comes with the
remainder of the former.’

‘Birth and Death’ being mentioned in a compound,—and it being not easy
to find out in which order of sequence these are to be taken,—and
intervention being possible by unlike causes of impurity also,—it is to
be understood, on the authority of usage, that what is meant is
intervention by a *like* cause of impurity (*i.e*. of impurity due to
death by another due to death and so forth). It is in this sense that
the use of the term ‘another’ becomes more justifiably significant.

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ also is meant to stand for *persons observing the
impurity*.

In another *Smṛti-text* it has been laid down that—‘if it happens at the
close of the night, then it is in two days; and if it happens at dawn,
then three days’; and having begun with the statement—‘when the Brāhmaṇa
dies, the impurity lasts for ten days’,—it goes on to say—‘if no one
dies or is born in the interval, he becomes pure after the remaining
days.’ And this takes no account of any distinction between like and
unlike sources of impurity.—(78).

(Verse 79 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 386), which notes that the
period of ‘ten days’ here mentioned stands for all periods of impurity
as laid down in the several cases,—and not for that of ‘ten days’
only;—and again on p. 388.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 622);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II,
p. 237), in the sense that when there is a commingling of two causes of
impurity, the later one lapses with the earlier;—again on p. 244 to the
same effect—*i*. *e*., the period of impurity due to a later cause
becomes contracted within the limits of that due to a previous
cause;—and again on p. 247 to the same effect;—and in *Hāralatā* (p.
61), which says that the qualification ‘*punaḥ*’, ‘again’ applies to
*death* only, and draws the following conclusion:—‘If during the ten
days of impurity duetto a death, another death or a birth should occur,
then the impurity ceases after the end of the said ten days due to the
former death;’ it goes on to say. that such is not. the case if *death*
occur during the period of impurity due to a *birth*, as the impurity
due to death is more serious than that due to birth, and hence cannot
merge into the latter.

*Gautama* (14.6).—‘If during a period of impurity, another death occurs,
the relatives shall he pure after the lapse of the remainder of the
former period.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.17-18).—‘If a birth and a death occur together, one
and the same period of ten days shall serve for both. If other births or
deaths happen before the completion of the ten days of the first
impurity, that first period will suffice; provided the new course of
impurity occurs before the end of the ninth day.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.23-25).—‘If during a period of impurity, another death or
birth occurs, the relatives shall be pure after the expiry of the
remainder of that first period. But if one night only of the first
period of impurity remain, they shall be pure after two days and nights.
If the second death or birth occurs on the morning of the day on which
the first period expires, they shall he pure after three days and
nights.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.35-38).—‘If during the period of impurity due to birth,
another birth occurs, then purification comes after the expiry of the
first period of impurity. If the second occurs when only one night
remains of the first period, then purification comes after two days. If
it occurs on the morning of the last day of the first period, then after
three days. Similarly on the death of a relative during the period of
impurity due to death.

*Yājñavalkya* (3.20).—‘If another birth or death happen during a period
of impurity, one becomes purified on the lapse of the remaining daws.’

*Aṅgiras* (Aparārka, p. 898).—If during a period of impurity due to
birth, a death occurs,—or during a period of impurity due to death, a
birth occurs,—then, the impurity is to he observed in accordance with
the death, not with the birth.’

*Ṣaṭtṛṃśan-mata* (Do.).—‘If during an impurity due to death, a birth
occurs, then purification from the impurity duo to the birth comes after
the lapse of the period of impurity due to death; the birth is not
purificatory of the impurity due to death.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 899).—‘When two equal causes of impurity
coalesce, the impurity should cease with the former; if they are not
equal, then with the second; such is the declaration of Dharmarāja.’

*Śaṅkha* (Do., p. 900).—‘If after the mother’s death the father dies,
then purification comes after the lapse of the impurity due to the
father’s death.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘If a cause happens lengthening the period of an impurity,
the impurity should cease with what happens later. If during a three-day
period of impurity, a ten-day impurity should occur, then purification
comes with the end of this latter.’

*Hārīta* (Aparārka, p. 900).—‘If an impurity due to death occurs during
an impurity due to death, purification comes with the lapse of the
previous impurity. A shorter impurity can remove another only when the
latter is a short one.’

*Prajāpati* (Do.).—‘If a son happen to be born during an impurity due to
another birth, then the father’s purification is immediate; he being
purified by the lapse of the previous impurity. When several impurities
coalesce, purification comes on the lapse of that which is the more
serious; when there is coalescence of impurity due to birth and another
due to death, that due to death is the more serious.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘There are two parts to every period of impurity;
if a fresh cause of impurity happen within the first part of a previous
impurity, then the purification comes on the lapse of the previous
impurity; if however it happen after that, then it comes on the lapse of
the second impurity. Similarly when during the impurity duo to one
death, another death happens. If during the impurity due to death, a
birth occurs,—or during the impurity due to birth, a death occurs,—then
purification comes on the lapse of the impurity duo to death.’

*Uśanas* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 622).—‘If during a shorter impurity, a
longer one happens, the purification cannot come with the lapse of the
former; it must take its own time.’

*Devala* (Do.).—‘When circumstances prolonging the impurity occur,
purification comes on the lapse of the succeeding one; but if the second
impurity occurs before the fifth day of the first one, then purification
comes on the lapse of the first one.’

*Parāśara* (3.28-29).—‘If during the ten days of impurity, another birth
or death should occur, the Brāhmaṇa shall remain impure till the expiry
of those ten days.’

‘*Learned*’—Who has studied the Vedic text.

‘*Companion*’—who, through friendship, has been living with one. Or
‘*upasampanna*’ may mean *endowed with good character*.

What has been said before (Verse 70) regarding the case of
‘fellow-students’ pertains to those who have not yet got up the entire
Veda.

In lexicons the term ‘*upasampanna*’ appears as a synonym for ‘dead’;
but in view of the long period of impurity laid down (which would not be
compatible with the case of a *stranger*), the former explanation is the
better of the two.

Others construe the text otherwise—explaining it to mean that ‘the
impurity lasts for three clays in the case of the *learned maternal
uncle*’ and ‘for a night along with the two days in the case of the
pupil, etc.’

The term ‘*relation*’ stands for the wife’s brother, the son of the
maternal aunt and so forth.

When we connect the ‘maternal uncle’ with^(‘)the night along with the
two days’,—then, since this period would be already applicable to the
case of the maternal uncle by reason of his being a ‘*relation*’, the
separate mention of him should he taken as making the rule compulsory in
his case; and this would mean that in the case of other *relations*, it
would be discretionary.—(80)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 81 of others.)

‘*Upasampanne*’—(a) ‘who lives with one out of friendship or on
business’ or (b) ‘endowed with good character’ (Medhātithi);—(c)
‘neighbour’ (Nārāyaṇa);—(d) ‘dead’ (suggested but rejected by
Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.24), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Upasampanna*’ means either ‘related by friendship or
neighbourliness’ or ‘possessed of good character’;—the ‘*mātula*’
includes the maternal cousin and other relations of that kind, and the
‘*bāndhava*’ stands for one’s own ‘*bāndhava*’ as also those of his
father and mother;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 129), which explains
‘*npasampanna*’ as ‘living in one’s own house’, *i.e*., if a Vedic
scholar living in one’s house happens to die etc.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 610), which explains
‘*Śrotriya*’ as standing for one who has learnt the same rescensional
text as the person himself,—‘*Upasampanna*’ as one who is endowed with
friendliness or neighbourliness;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 431), as laying
down the rule relating to the case of the highly qualified *Śrotriya*,
or such near relations as the maternal uncle and the like; it explains
‘*upasampanna*’ as one endowed with friendliness or with good
qualities;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 76), which adds the explanation:—‘on
the death of a Vedic Scholar belonging to another family in one’s own
house,—or on that of a Vedic Scholar who is *a near* *neighbour*
(‘*upasampanna*’) etc.’—and in the case of the mother’s uterine brother,
if the death takes place in another place, the impurity lasts for two
days and one night,—‘*Śiṣya*’, one who, though initiated by some one
else, has learnt, from one a portion of the Veda, or the subsidiary
sciences—in this case also the impurity lasts for two days and one
night,—‘*ṛtvik*’ one who has officiated at one’s sacrifices,—‘bāndhava’,
blood relation.

The name ‘*rājan*’ is really applied indirectly to the man of a
particular caste as endowed with the qualifications of *anointment* and
the rest; that it is so is clear from the clause^(‘)*in whose realm he
lives*.’ In fact when the word signifies the lord of a country belonging
to a particular caste, it does so only by indirect indication, and not
by direct denotation.

‘*Till the light*’—*i.e*., it continues along with the light. That is,
if the death occurs during the day, the impurity lasts during the day
only, and it does not go on into the night; similarly if the death
occurs at night, it lasts during the night only, and does not extend to
the day. The fact that the text has used this peculiar
expression—‘*sajyotiḥ*’, ‘*till the light*’—in the present context (when
*only* day, and *only* night are meant),—is indicative of the fact that
whenever the term ‘day’ or ‘night’ is used, it means *both day and
night*; *e.g*., in verses 5.66 and 5.59. in 5.64 also, where the term
‘night’ is used in addition to the term ‘day’, it is added only for the
purpose of filling up the metre.

At night, the ‘light’ is that of fire, as we rend in the Brāhmaṇa-text
bearing upon the *Agnihotra*—‘The night becomes resplendent with the
light of fire, not with the light of the Sun.’

In the case of the ‘*non-learned*’—who does not study the
Veda—‘*teacher*’—it lasts during the whole day; it does not extend to
the night, even when the cause of impurity happens during the night.

“How can a ‘non-learned’ man be a ‘teacher’? In fact it is only one who
has learnt the Veda along with its subsidiary sciences that is entitled
to do the work of *teaching*.”

True; but a mere *expounder* is also called a ‘teacher.’ Hence what is
meant is that ‘in the case of the person who has, somehow, learnt the
subsidiary sciences (without learning the Veda) and expounds them, the
impurity lasts during the day.’ That this must be the meaning is
indicated by the fact that there is a distinct rule reference to the
Teacher who is properly qualified, or to the Initiating Preceptor, who
is the principal object of reverence.

Some people connect the negative prefix in ‘*non-learned*’ with the term
‘teacher’; and explain the rule laid down as referring to ‘the learned
man who is the teacher of other persons, and bears no relation to the

(Verse 82 of others.)

‘*Anūcāne tathā gurau*’—‘A *guru* who expounds the Veda along with the
subsidiary sciences’ (Govindarājā, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the *guru
and* the person capable of expounding the Veda’ (Nārāyaṇa);—Medhātithi
construes ‘*anūcāne*’ with ‘*aśrotriye*’, and explains it to mean ‘one
who, though not learned in the Veda, is yet conversant with the
subsidiary sciences’;—Nandana (and also ‘others’ in Medhātithi) read
‘*agurau*’, and explains ‘*anūcāne agurau*’ ‘one who is learned in the
Vedas and its subsidiaries, but is not one’s *guru*’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 215), which explains ‘*Sajyotiḥ*’
as that *impurity* which lasts ‘as long as the light’, of the sun, or of
the stars;—in *Mitākṣarā*, which also explains the meaning to be that
the impurity lasts as long as the light; *i*. *e*., if death has
occurred during the day, then it lasts till sunset, while if it has
occurred during the night, then as long as the stars are visible;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 613), which offers the same explanation,
and in the same words, as Mitākṣarā;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 435), which
explains the term ‘*Sajyotiḥ*’ as ‘lasting as long as the light’, and
adds—‘during the day, it lasts till sunset, and during the night, till
sunrise’;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 76), which adds the following
explanation:—That Kṣatriya king in whose territories one lives, if such
a king, who is not a Vedic Scholar, dies, then the impurity is
‘*Sajyotiṣ*’, *i*.*e*., if the death occurs during the day, it lasts as
long as the sun is visible, and if it occurs during the night, then as
long as the stars are visible,—if the said king is an expounder of the
Veda, the impurity lasts the whole day and night,—‘anūcāna’ is one who
has studied the Veda and is capable of expounding it,—similarly if the
‘*guru*’ dies, the impurity lasts the whole day and night, ‘*guru*’ is
one who has taught a little of the subsidiary sciences.

The alternative rales—limiting the period of impurity to ‘three days’,
‘four days’ &c.,—have been laid down above, in consideration of the
character and learning of the persons concerned; and the present verse
is added with a view to preclude those alternatives from the *Kṣatriya*
and other castes. The mention of ‘ten days’ in regard to the *Brāhmaṇa*
however is a mere reiteration.

In this connection the following question is likely to arise—“What is
the text that restricts the period of impurity for the *Kṣatriya* to
*twelve days* (or of the *Vaiśya* to fifteen days, and so forth)
compulsorily, on the strength whereof the present verse is taken as
precluding the other alternatives from them?”

This present text itself serves to indicate the time mentioned as
applying to those castes. And in the face of this text, the other
periods of ‘ten’ days and so forth, wherever mentioned, are understood
to be merely indicative of the period specified for each caste. As a
matter of fact, however, even in the presence of the present verse, the
mention of ‘ten days’ need not be taken to be indicative (as just
stated). For even though the section as a whole may pertain to all four
castes, yet the alternatives mentioned can pertain only to that caste
for whom the period of ‘ten days’ has been laid down. In another
Smṛti-text it is with special reference to the *Brāhmaṇa* that it has
been asserted that—‘the *Brāhmaṇa* may resume Vedic study after one
day’; and it is to this that all the other alternatives mentioned in
other Smṛti texts have to be taken as optional. In any case, on the
eleventh day there is no impurity at all.

The author of the *Vivaraṇa* says that in the present verse special
significance is meant to be attached to the use of the term ‘day’ (and
it is the *day* that is meant, as distinguished from the *night*); so
that there is no impurity on the tenth *night*; and hence it is only
right and proper that invitations to the *śrāddha* on the eleventh day
should be issued on the previous day. When a person is going to set up
the Fire, the impurity shall be wiped off by the vigil kept daring the
previous night.

This however is not right. If the term ‘day’ meant the *day* only, then
on the other days also there would be no imparity daring the *nights*.
It might be argued that those intervening *nights* would (all within the
period of impurity by virtue of the general rule that ‘impurity due to
death *lasts for ten days*’ (5.59). But what is the authority for
denying a similar significant to the term ‘day’ in this context also?

Is is for these reasons that we have explained that throughout this
context the word ‘day’ stands for the *day and night*. It is for this
reason that in the preceding verse, where the day only is meant, we have
the epithet ‘*whole*’, ‘*kṛtsnam*’ added to it.—(82).

six years and two months of age,—for the survivor who is ignorant of the
Veda and has not set up the fires, but has passed through all the
sacramental rites, the impurity in the case of the Brāhmaṇa lasts for
ten days;—it adds that if death occurs before sunrise, then the
preceding day is to be counted among the ten,—if the survivor is an
Agnihotri or Vedic scholar, it is over in a single day;—and in

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Some people may entertain the following notion:—“The various
alternatives that have been laid down regarding the period of impurity
extending to three days, *&c*., all stand on an equal footing with the
alternative of ‘ten days,’ and their adoption is not regulated by
considerations of character and study, etc.; so that the observing of
the longer period being open to me, why should I have recourse to the
alternative of ‘one day’, which would entail the trouble of resuming my
studies sooner? I shall have recourse to the alternative of ‘ten days’,
and shall enjoy the pleasure of having nothing to do for a longer
period.”

It is for the benefit of such a person that the author, moved by
sympathy, makes it clear that the optional alternatives are regulated by
other considerations; and that they do not all stand on the same
footing. In what way they are regulated has been already shown by us.

If this be not the meaning of the present advice, and if it mean
something else,—what possibility would there be of any prolongation of
the period that has been specifically fixed for each individual? And it
is only with such a possibility that there could be room for the advice
contained in the present verse. What harm could there be in the author
making still clearer what he has already said before (regarding the
regulation of the optional alternatives)?

Some people hold that—even after the prescribed number of days have
elapsed, purification is not accomplished until bathing and other rites
have been performed; as it is going to be asserted that ‘the *Brāhmaṇa*
becomes pure after touching water, etc.’ (Verse 98); and some one may
think that so long as he remains impure he would not incur any sin by
the omission of religious duties, and hence he may not proceed to take
the bath or other rites;—and it is in view of such cases that we have
the injunction that ‘*one should not prolong the days of impurity*,’—the
meaning being that the stipulated days having elapsed, one should not
delay the external purifications.

As regards the assertion that—“the use of the term *day* implies that
there is no impurity on the *night* of the tenth day,”—it has already
been pointed out that this view is not correct. Says Gautama (14.6)—‘If
during one impurity another source of impurity should arise, there is
purification after the remainder of the former’; and having said this,
he thought that people might be led to think that if the second impurity
should arise about the end of the last night, there would be
purification after that night, and in order to guard against this he has
added—‘if it happens about the end of the night, then after two nights’
(14.7) \[From which it is dear that the lost *night* also falls within
the period of impurity\].

‘*Nor should he interrupt the rites performed in the fires*.’—This is
said in view of the fact by reason of impurity all the rites prescribed
in the *Śruti* and the *Smṛti* become precluded. The meaning is that the
rites that are performed in the fires,—such as the Evening-libation and
the rest—should not be *interrupted*,—*i.e*., shall not be omitted.
‘*Interruption*’ means *omission, non-per* *formance*.

But this does not mean that the impure man should himself perform the
rites; since it is added—‘*he who performs the rites*, *even if he be a
Sapiṇḍa, would never be impure*’; which means that ‘even a
Sapiṇḍa-relation would not be impure, to say nothing of other persons’;
says the *Gṛhyasūtra* also—‘They should perform in the house-fire the
obligatory rites, with the exception of the *Vaitāna* -rite’; and
then—‘others would perform these.’ This does not refer to the mere
offering of libations that is done in connection with the setting up of
the fires, but to the performance of the rite in all its details; since
it is only for these that the employment of other agents is possible,
since the principal libation itself, which consists in offering certain
substances, can be offered by the householder himself. Hence the rites
that are precluded (daring impurity) are those of the
*Vaiśvadeva-offering* and the *Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices. Of
other nets, such as the telling of beads, the saying of Twilight Prayers
and so forth,—the preclusion of these has nowhere been indicated; and
all these are obligatory. Hence what the present taxt does is to permit
the performance of other acts; specially as another *Smṛti* text has
prohibited such acts as ‘the offering of libations and Vedic study.’
Thus then, the distinction (as to what acts are precluded and what not)
is based upon the obligatory or voluntary character of the acts
themselves; specially as the voluntary act tending to the accomplishment
of desired ends should never be done, since impurity deprives the man of
the title to perform all such acts.

“But the impure man cannot be entitled to the performance of the
obligatory acts either.”

As a matter of fact, *purity* does not constitute an essential factor in
the rites; and though an obligatory act may be done even in a slightly
deficient form (due to the lack of *purity*, for instance), such is not
permissible in the case of voluntary acts done with a view to definite
ends. It might be argued that they also might be performed, on the
strength of the present text itself. But this would not be right; for
all that the present text permits is getting certain rites performed by
proxy; and as this in itself would be a deficiency, it would be
admissible in the case of the obligatory rites only, and not in that of
voluntary ones.

With regard to the *Vaiśvadeva* offering however, there is a difference
of opinion. Some people quote the following *Smṛti* -text—‘At a birth or
a death, one shall not pour libations into fire, even with dry grains or
fruits, nor should he perform any sacrificial rites.’

From all this it follows that one should offer the following the
Twilight-libations, the *Dūrśa-Purṇamāsa* sacrifices, the Annual
*Śrāddha*, the *Śrāddha* offered in the month of Āśvina and so forth. As
for the Upākarma, its performance depends upon the lunar asterism and it
need not be done on the full-moon-day.—(83.)

(Verse 84 of others.)

‘*Pratyūhenṅāgniṣu kriyāḥ*’—Medhātithi has been misrepresented here, not
only by Buhler, but by Kullūka also. There is nothing in Medhātithi to
show that *Sandhyopāsana* should be omitted for ten days. Nor is there
any difference in the interpretation of Medhātithi and that of Kullūka
and others. (See *Translation*.)

‘*Sanābhayaḥ*’—‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda);—‘*Sahodara*’, ‘uterine brother’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 891), which adds the following
notes:—With a view to remaining idle, without having to perform his
religious duties, one should not prolong the days of impurity; nor
should he abandon those necessary acts that are prescribed to be
performed in the *śrauta* fires,—*e.g*., the Agnihotra offerings; the
meaning is that all those should be done even during the days of
impurity;—the second half is added in anticipation of the objection that
“in view of the rule whereby *impure* men are not entitled to the
performance of religious acts, it would be right to abandon the acts
during the period of impurity.” What is meant is that it is quite true
that the *impure* m an should not perform religious acts; but on the
strength of the special texts (like the present one) hearing upon
certain Well defined acts, one would be justified in concluding that he
is *not* ‘impure’, so far as the performance of these acts is
concerned.—The use of *Atmanepada* form ‘*kurvāṇaḥ*’ makes it clear that
the actual *performer* of the religions acts is *not impure*—even though
the person dead or born be a very near relation of his,—in fact he is
quite pure. Inasmuch as this absence of impurity refers to the
*performer* himself, it follows that so far as officiating at the
performance of other persons is concerned, the near relations of the
dead or the born must be regarded as *impure* and unqualified.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.17), in support of the view that there
is no impurity regarding the performance of those religious acts that
are compulsory, the voluntary ones, however, which are done for the
purpose of gaining reward, should not be performed during impurity;—and
it adds that since the text specifically mentions the acts done ‘in the
fires’, it follows that the ‘five great sacrifices,’ which are not done
in *fire*, should cease during impurity.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 254) as affording justification
for the coalescing of ‘impurities’ due to more than one cause;—in
*Hāralatā* (pp. 7 and 25), which notes that the expression ‘*tat karma*’
implies that the impurity means incapacity to perform such acts as
Fire-kindling, gifts, Homa and so forth, and adds the following
notes:—‘*aghāhāni*’, days of impurity, those should not be prolonged by
the Agnihotrin, for whom its curtailment is justified by distinct texts;
and he should never observe the full period of ten days,—even dining the
curtailed period, he should not entirely stop the offerings into the
Fires, he should have this done through Brāhmaṇas belonging to other
*gotras* and hence not suffering from the same disabilities,—and the
reason for this lies in the fact that in the performance of the said
acts of disablity does not attach even to the *Sapiṇḍa*,—what to say of
persons of other *gotras*?

It is quoted also in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 278), which explains
‘*sanābhayaḥ*’ as *Sapiṇḍa*,—‘*tatkarma*’ as *officiating as a
priest*,—the disability due to impurity does hot attach to him, if no
person of other *gotras* is available for the work,—such is the
implication of the particle ‘*api*’.

The ‘*divākīrti*’ is the *cāṇḍāla*; that it is so is clear from the fact
that he is mentioned along with the worst untouchables, and also from
the use of the name in the *Mahābhārata*, in course of a conversation
between the Cat and the Mouse—‘at that time the *Divākīrti* became
oppressed with fear’ (where it is the *cāṇḍāla* that is clearly meant).
It cannot stand for the *barber* here; for the barber is among the
touchables, and also because he is one whose food may be eaten (by the
*Brāhmaṇa*). As for the rule laying down the necessity of bathing after
a shave, this cannot be put forward in the present context, as the
bathing in this case is necessitated by the consideration that, while
one is shaving hairs are bound to fall on the body, and as, on falling
from the body, they are unclean, it is necessary that one should bathe.

‘*Tatspṛṣṭinam*’, ‘*the toucher thereof*.’—This compound is to be
expounded as—‘*tasya spṛṣṭam, tadasyāsti*’. The men who touch those
mentioned above have also got to bathe.

Some people argue that, as the persons mentioned are not all in equal
proximity to the term ‘*tatspṛṣṭinam*,’ ‘*the toucher thereof*,’ this
refers to the ‘*dead body*’ only, and not to the ‘*Cāṇḍāla*’ and the
rest. But others hold that since all are mentioned in the same sentence,
and since the term occurs at the end of all the other persons mentioned,
all these are present before the mind, and hence referred to by the
pronoun ‘*thereof*‘; so that the construction intended is that all the
terms up to ‘*śaram*’, ‘*the dead body*’, form one copulative compound,
and then compounded with ‘*spṛṣṭinam*’, ‘*toucher*’; and hence when the
term ‘*the toucher thereof*’ comes up, all the things spoken of by all
the members of the copulative compound come to the mind. There is, on
the other band, nothing to indicate that the term ‘*toucher*’ is to be
connected with the ‘*dead body*’ only; for the simple reason that it is
equally connected with the ‘outcast’ and the rest also. In fact, all
that is clearly indicated is that the term ‘*toucher*’ is connected with
some other term that has gone before; in a copulative compound however,
each term is regarded as denoting all the things spoken of; and hence
all these latter are equally closely related to the term ‘*toucher*’.
Another construction that might be suggested is to construe the term
‘toucher thereof’ with the term ‘dead body’, and then with the other
terms. But in this case, there would be nothing to justify the
connection of the term ‘toucher’ with the ‘outcast’ and the rest.

From all this it follows that it is only on the strength of usage that a
right conclusion can be arrived at.—(84)

(Verse 85 of others.)

‘*Tatspṛṣṭinam*’—‘One who has touched these, *i.e*., the *Divākīrti* and
the rest’ (Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana); ‘one who has touched a
corpse’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is.quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 921), which adds the
following:—Even though through its proximity to the term ‘*śava*’,
‘*tatspṛṣṭinam*’ would appear to mean ‘one who has touched a *śava*’,
yet inasmuch as the ‘*Divākīrti*’ and others mentioned before also
belong, like the corpse, to the category of ‘unclean things’, it is only
right that one who touches the person that has touched *all those*
should bathe. This agrees with Medhātithi.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3. 30) to the effect that even when
between the man and an unclean thing, there interposes a *living thing*
(like the man who has touched the unclean things) the man has to bathe.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 258) to the effect that the man who
touches one who has touched the *Divākīrti* and the rest, should bathe;
*i.e*., the touch of an unclean thing defiles also when it is indirect,
being interposed by a living object (like the man touching the Divākīrti
&c.).

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 202), which explains
*Divākīrti* as ‘Chaṇḍāla’;—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 54), which
reproduces the note made by *Madanapārijāta* is quoted in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 257), which explains ‘*divākīrti*’ as
‘Chaṇḍāla’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 796);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*. (p.
327), which explains ‘*divākīrti*’ as ‘chaṇḍāla’;—in *Ācāramayūkha* (p.
42);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 159 and 468), which explains
‘*tatspṛṣṭin*’ as ‘one who has touched a dead body’.

‘*Unclean things*’.— Those just mentioned are to be understood as meant
here, because of their proximity.

Those *mantras* that are addressed to the Sun are called ‘*Solar*’ and
the mantras meant are ‘*udutyam jātavedasam*, &c. &c.’

The *Pāvamānī verses*.—*The* verses ‘*svādiṣṭaye*, &c. &c.’ occurring in
the ninth *maṇḍala* of the Ṛgveda.

‘*According to his inclination*’ and ‘*according to his capacity*’ mean
the same thing; two words have been used for the purposes of metre.

In as much as the ‘mantras’ and ‘verses’ are mentioned in the plural, at
least three verses should be recited; and as regards more, they may be
recited only if other and more important duties do not suffer thereby.
Then again, since the text speaks of ‘*mantras* and the term
‘*Pāramānī*’ also refers to *verses*, purification is brought about as
soon as one has gone beyond three verses, even though the hymn may not
be completed.

The *dog* also has to be included among the ‘*unclean things*’; as it
also is *unclean*. In the present context Gautama has declared—‘Of the
dog also; whatever it might pollute, say some’ (14.29-30).

‘*Attentively*’;—without allowing his mind to wander about; he should
fix it upon contemplating the deity. Or, ‘*Prayataḥ*’ may mean that ‘at
a time when one is busy with worshipping deities, if he should happen to
touch an unclean thing, he should do what is here laid down,—and not
otherwise’.—(85).

being that ‘whenever one happens to *see* any of the unclean things just
enumerated, he shall do *ācamana* and then recite the verses
prescribed.’

day (when the bone is dry).

‘*Ādiṣṭa*’ means ‘*ādeśa*’, ‘instruction’; and the term ‘*person under
instruction*’ denotes the *Student*, by reason of his connection with
the instruction that he receives regarding his observances. The present
text prohibits the making of water-offerings by one who is still in the
state of the Student, to such *Sapiṇḍa* relations as may happen to die
*during that period*. As for those that have died before, the offering
of water to the forefathers and Gods has already been prescribed for the
Student also.

‘*Till the completion of his pupilage*;—*i.e*. till the performance of
the ‘*Samāvartana*’ ceremony; and it does not mean any forced completion
of the stage in the interval.

On returning after having finished his observances, he shall make a
water-offering to each of the dead relations on one day; and he should
observe ‘impurity’ for three days.

As regards the making of water-offering to his mother, this is necessary
for the Student also; and such an offering does not interfere with the
proper fulfilment of his observances. In support of this they quote
another *Smṛti* -text—*viz*. ‘The person undergoing instruction does not
commit a wrong in making a water-offering.’—(87).

(Verse 88 of others).

This rule does not apply to the case of the mother (Medhātithi),—father
and mother (Govindarāja),—father, mother and ācārya (Kulluka).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 876), which adds the following
notes:—‘*ādiṣṭī*’ is the ‘Religious Student,’—‘*āvratasya samāpanāt*’
means ‘till the *Samāvartana* ceremony has been performed’;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 3.5) which adds that the Religious Student is called
‘*ādiṣṭī*’ by reason of his receiving such *ādiṣṭa, ādeśa*, injunction,
as ‘Thou art a Religious Student, drink water, do your duty’ and so
forth;—that this refers to the death of persons other than the Father
and others.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 405) as pertaining to cases other
than the death of the ‘mother and others—it explains ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ as
‘Religious Student,’ but adds that some people explain the term as ‘one
who is undergoing expiatory penance.’ The second half means that on the
expiration of the ‘*vrata*,’ he shall make the water-offering and remain
impure for three days.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayansindhu* (pp. 195 and 392) to the effect that
after the *Samāvartana* ceremony has been performed, the Religious
Student shall observe an ‘impurity’ for three days, for the death of
persons that may have occurred during his studentship;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 313), which explains ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ as the
Religious Student;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 201), which has the following
note:—‘*ādiṣṭa*’ stands for the observances prescribed in connection
with Vedic study, and ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ stands for the Religious Student, as
also for other persons that may be keeping certain observances; so long
as the course of the observance has not been finished, the man should
not offer

the death-oblations even to his Preceptor;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*, (p.
295), which says that *Mitākṣarā* has explained ‘*ādiṣṭī*’ as the
Religious Student;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 216).

The water-offering is withdrawn from those born in vain and from intermixture, from those who are addicted to asceticism and from those who have abandoned themselves.—(88)


(A) Well, Gautama (14.12) has said—‘In the case of those dying from hunger, by a weapon, by fire, by poison, in water, in prison, or from a precipice,—it is only when it is unintentional.’ While in the verse just quoted it is said simply, without any qualification ‘Those dying at the hands of the Cāṇḍāla &c.’ And on account of the necessity of reconciling this with what has been said in the other Smṛti text regarding the case of ‘dying in water’ &c., it must be ‘intentional death’ that is meant. And the idea arises that by reason of ‘association,’ the same should be the case with the others also.


(B) On the other hand, the verse quoted uses the term ‘sinful’; and all sinful act has been prohibited; he who does what is prohibited is called ‘sinful’. And a man becomes the ‘doer’ of an act through his own initiative, as also through the urging of another person. Now, death ‘from lightning, and the fanged and horned animals’ could never belong to the former category (i.e. this could never be intentional); and no one is ever urged by others to such death; nor are these means of dying employed by suicides, as holes, water and sword etc., are, and it is only if these were so, and the man were to kill himself by having recourse to these, that he could be the ‘self-sufficient agett (agent?),’ of the act of ‘dying.’ The truth therefore is that the man who comes by such death is understood to have been sinful in his previous life,—as is learnt from the scriptures; just as the possession of ‘black teeth’ and the rest. If it be asked—‘what is the use of this fact of the man’s having been sinful in the past being indicated?’ But in the case of persons with deficient limbs etc.,; their previous connection with sin is clearly indicated; and the expiatory rite to be performed in the case has been laid down by Vaśiṣṭha, as consisting, in the case of some men, of the performance of two Kṛcchras, and in that of others, of something more.


(C) In reality however, the suicide having died, can have nothing to do with the performance of any rites. Or, if he be regarded as having commited a grievous sin, then, any person who may have entered into any kind of relationship with him—marital, or friendly, or sacrificial,—would also have to be regarded as sinful. But such is not the usage of cultured men. For as a matter of fact, people having relationship with suicides are not looked down upon in any way; nor do they perform any expiatory rites.


(D) Some people, having read, in another Smṛti text, the words—‘those killed by cows and Brāhmaṇas etc.’—read the words ‘those who have abandoned themselves’ apart by themselves, and seem to take up an entirely different position.


The right view is that intentional suicides are what are meant;—why?—because of their being spoken of as ‘sinful.’ The man who intentionally proceeds to set into activity the causes leading to his own death, wilfully disobeys the law that ‘no man shall by his own desire, cut off his life-span and it is only right that such a transgressor should be spoken of as ‘sinful.’

The term ‘born’ is to be construed separately with each of the two terms
with which it is compounded. He is said to be ^(‘)*born in vain*’ who
does not worship Gods, Pitṛs or Men; *i*. *e*. he who does not lead the
life proper for uny of the four stages of life, even though he is
capable of doing so; one who is excluded from all offerings and
invitations. Having referred to the man ‘who for one year does not lead
the life proper for any stage,’ the scriptures speak of a great sin
attaching to persons doing this for any length of time. This is so
because with the exception of the Student and the Renunciate, all the
others have to cook food for other people; and it is only cooking for
one’s own self alone that has been prohibited.

‘*Born of intermixture*;’—*i.e*., the *Āyogara*’ and other persons born
of an improper and inverse mixture of the several castes; that the issue
of improper mixtures is meant is indicated by its association with those
‘born in vain,’ which implies lowness of birth. As regards the issue of
legal mixtures, even though these also are ‘born of intermixtures,’ yet
these are not meant here, because they belong definitely to their
mother’s caste and are entitled to all that pertains thereto. Further,
in ordinary usage children of legal mixtures are not spoken of as being
of ‘mixed origin’; *e.g*. in 10.25, where the issues of ‘mixed origin’
are described. The term also includes (*a*) the children of such widows
as have not been ‘permitted’ to beget children, born of the intercourse
of several men, and (*b*) the children of prostitutes; the children of
women begotten by a person other than their husbands are not included in
this category, if there has not been intercourse with several men.

Some people hold that this prohibition refers to *Sapiṇḍa* relations who
are as described, and not to their sons; while in the case of those who
have ‘*abandoned themselves*,’ it applies to their sons also.

This however is not right; as the text makes no distinction among those
mentioned.

*Asceticisms*; *i.e*., of heretics, such as the ‘*Bhagala*,’ the
‘*Raktapaṭa*’ and the rest. That these are meant is indicated by the
plural number and by the fact that it is the heterodox heretic alone
that is excluded. These are regarded as ‘heterodox’ by reason of their
observances &c., being different from those of the orthodox ascetics.

‘*Those who have abandoned themselves*;’—*i.e* ., those who, even before
their life’s span has been run out, give up their bodies (by committing
suicide). \[It is only such suicide that is reprehensible\]. It is
considered quite desirable in the case of old men suffering from
incurable diseases given up by the physicians; as has been thus
declared:—‘If an old man,—incapable of purification and memory, who has
passed beyond the reach of the physician’s art,—kills himself by falling
down from a precipice, or entering into fire, or by fasting, or by
drowning in water,—in his case there is impurity for three days; his
bones being collected on the second day, on the third day the water
offering-should be made, and on the fourth day the *Śrāddha* should be
performed’. Suicide is regarded as desirable also in the case of persons
suffering from leprosy and such other diseases; as has been said in
connection with men who, though still in the Householder’s state, have
lost all energy,—‘Bent upon entering the Great Path, they do not wish to
live on uselessly.’ That man is called ‘devoid of energy’ who is
incapable of doing purificatory acts, as also saying the Twilight
Prayers *&c*. Then again, in texts deprecating suicide, the words used
are—‘if one whose body has not been emaciated, or who has not lost all
energy, should kill himself &c. &c.’; which implies that it is permitted
for those who are not such as here described.

Other Smṛti-texts prohibit the water-offering for other persons also. It
has been thus declared—‘Those killed by kings, those killed by horned or
fanged animals, or by serpents, and those who have abandoned
themselves,—to these no *Śrāddha* is to be offered; and water,
ball-offerings and other offerings that are made to the dead, all this
does not reach them, it becomes lost in the intervening regions. Through
fear of popular blame, one should make the *Nārāyaṇa* offering; and for
the sake of these also food-grains, along with the additional fee, shall
be given.’

Elsewhere again—

‘Sinful men meet death from the *Cāṇḍāla*, from water, from serpents,
from Brāhmaṇas, from lightning and from fanged animals.’

It is also laid down that—

‘For incendiaries, for keepers of baths and makers of ornaments and for
professional mourners, there is purification after the performance of
two *Taptakṛcchra* penances. Hence for these no after-death rites shall
be performed by others; even the name of such persons, or of their
family, should not be pronounced. For truly fearful is the uttering of
the name of such a great sinner, who has gone to the worst hells.’

It is in connection with the acts mentioned here that Saṃvartn has
prescribed the ‘*Sāntapana*’ penance; and Parāśara has laid down the
‘*Taptakṛcchra*’; and Vaśiṣṭha has prescribed the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ along
with the ^(‘)*Taptakṛcchra*’. But these differences may be ignored.

With reference to what has been said above regarding ‘the death of
sinners’ resulting from ‘the Cāṇḍāla, from water &c. &c.,’ there arises
the following question—“Does this rule, regarding the non-performance of
the *Śrāddha* and the performance of penance, pertain to the Cāṇḍāla who
kills himself intentionally?—or to one who is killed through
carelessness, without intention?”

Why should this question arise?

> \(A\) Well, Gautama (14.12) has said—‘In the case of those dying from

From this it follows that what is meant is *intentional* death.

> words—‘those killed by cows and Brāhmaṇas etc.’—read the words ‘those

From all this (A, B, C and D) there arises the above-mentioned doubt—as
to what is the right view.

> The right view is that *intentional suicides* are what are

“But it has been said and pointed out above that the causes of death
spoken of do not resemble the sword and other things used by suicides;
so that the intentional killing of oneself could not be meant.”

Our answer to this is as follows:—If a man does not guard himself
against a danger, he is regarded to be as good as having brought it upon
himself. So that if a man wanders about alone in a forest infested with
*cāṇḍālas* and robbers,—even though he may not have the wish that they
should kill him, yet—there is disobedience of scriptures on his part,
since he acts in a way that invites danger, and he does nothing to avert
that danger. Similarly with the man who goes to swim in the river, or
enters a boat of doubtful capacity rowed by incompetent boatsmen. Under
such circumstances, if by the loss of vigour, or by the turning over of
the boat, the man should happen to die, it would be only right to regard
him as having committed a sin. On the contrary, if persons were to bathe
in water, whose depth they have duly ascertained by means of sticks
etc., and of the presence wherein of alligators and other animals they,
are ignorant,—and were to be carried away by any such animals, no blame
would attach to them. Similarly if one gets into a boat, which is
well-fastened, and rowed by capable rowers, and proceeds to cross a
swift stream,—if, on the sudden rising of a strong wind, the boat happen
to be tossed on a whril (whirl?)-pool and capsize, and the man become
drowned,—he would not have transgressed the scriptures at all. Similarly
again, if one did not carefully avoid places known to be infested with
snakes, and being bitten by a snake were to die, he would have acted
sinfully; not otherwise. Similarly if one does not run to a safe
distance, on seeing a sharp-horned cow or an elephant, and become
killed, he is rightly regarded as sinful. Similarly again if, when it is
raining heavily and lightning is flashing, if one wanders about in
desolate places and does not take shelter in a village or town,—his
action is reprehensible. While if the lightning should, by chance,
happen to fall upon a man who is in the village, there would be nothing
sinful on the part of the man. For these reasons it is always right and
proper that the man should do all that has been laid down (for his
safety).

The prohibiting of ‘water-offerings’ should be taken as applicable to
all kinds of after-death rites; for such is the view propounded in
another *Smṛti* -text.—(88)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

One who has renounced the scriptures and has taken to wearing such
things as the human skull, red garments and so forth, on the bans of
heterodox theories of life and morals, is a ‘*heretic*.’ Those women who
have ‘*joined*’, Such a person,—*i.e*. who have adopted his
distinguishing murks and are under his control.

‘*Those who behave too freely*.’—When a woman renounces the customs and
usages of her family, and ullowing free scope to her desires, has
recourse to one as well as several men,—her behaviour is called ‘free.’

The ‘injury’ to the husband consists in giving him poison etc.; and that
to the child in the womb consists in abortion.

‘*Those who drink wine*;’—*i.e*. those who drink what is prohibited.

On this subject some one makes the following observations:—

“The prohibition of wine-drinking is found in the words ‘*brāhmaṇo na
pibet surām*’, (‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not drink wine’); and though the
words apply to all members of the caste, yet the particular gender used
is indicative of the fact that the prohibition applies to males only,
and not to females. Though both the male and the female belong to the
same caste, yet there is a distinct difference between the masculine and
feminine genders. So that when the text uses the masculine form
‘*brāhmaṇaḥ*’, what possibility is there of the prohibition applying to
the female, who is not mentioned at all? For instance, when it is said
that ‘for the sake of a son one should make the *Brāhmaṇī* drink’ a
certain substance, it is not understood to mean that the *male* Brāhmaṇa
should be made to drink it. In the same manner when a text makes use of
the masculine form, what it asserts cannot be predicated of females. It
is true that in some cases, significance is not meant to be attached to
the particular gender used;—*e.g*., in the text ‘the Brāhmaṇa should not
be killed’, where the prohibition is understood to apply to the killing
of the *female* Brāhmaṇa also. But what happens in this latter case is
that the direct signification of the Accusative case-ending marks out
the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ to be the predominant factor by reason of his being
what is most intended to be ‘got at’ by the preadicate; and as a rule in
the case of the predominant factor no significance is attached to the
gender, or the number or any other factor, except what is expressed by
the basic noun itself. *E.g*. the injunction ‘wash the cup’ is not taken
to mean the washing of only *one* cup. In the case under discussion,
however, the prohibitive text is in the form ‘*Brāhmaṇena surā nu peyā*’
(‘wine shall not be drunk *by the Brāhmaṇa*’,) where the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*
appears as the Nominative, and as such, an accessory in the fulfilment
of the act denoted; so that in the case of the prohibition in the
form—‘The Brāhmaṇa shall not drink wine’—also, the nominative being
denoted by the verb (with its conjugational ending), is expressed by the
basic noun (‘*brāhmaṇa*’) and comes to be taken as something conducive
to the fulfilment of the act denoted by the verb; so that the nominative
ending in this text is to be construed on the same lines as the
Instrumental in the preceding text; and it has to be taken as a
subordinate factor. And in connection with a subordinate factor, all
that is expressed by the word has to be taken as significant; for
instance, in the case of the text ‘*paśunā yajeta*’, (‘sacrifice with an
animal’), it is the *male* animal that is always sacrificed (and this on
account of the Instrumental ending marking out the *animal* as the
subordinate factor).”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—In such cases as the one under
consideration whether a certain thing form the predominant or the
subordinate factor is not determined by the Accusative or Instrumental
case-ending, but upon its being or not being already known. That is to
say, what is not already known, that alone can form the subject of the
Injunction, and this is to which due significance is meant to be
attached; and this for the simple reason that it is denoted by a word
which can have no other denotation; while what is already known from
other sources, and is mentioned for the sake of the In junction, has to
be taken as subserving the purposes of the Injunction in exactly the
same form in which it has been denoted by the previous word. In the
sentence ‘the Brāhmaṇa should not be killed’, all that the Injunction
directly signifies is the *prohibition* of the act of killing, and
everything else (mentioned in the sentence) is such as is already known
from other sources. Even so however, due significance has to be attached
to what is expressed by the basic nouns (in the sentence), as otherwise,
their very use would come to be meaningless. But the gender, the number
and other elements, which are denoted by the case-endings,—it is just
possible that these are used simply because they are invariable
concomitants of basic nouns (which cannot be used by themselves without
a case-ending); and hence sometimes these latter are meant to be
significant, sometimes not. As regards the killing of the Brāhmaṇa, no
man requires to be urged to do it by an Injunction; as he is urged to it
by his own hatred of the man he kills; and all men are, by their very
nature, prone to do this act But as regards the *prohibition* of it,
unless it were directly enjoined, it could not be got at by any means;
specially as it could not be obtained from any other source. So that,
since it is not in any way conducive to the fulfilment of an act, nor is
it the qualification of anything so conducive, hence, even though it
were to be included under the nature of man, it could not be connected
with the context. Consequently, for the purpose of connecting it with
the context it is necessary to attribute to it the character of the
*topic*; and when the prohibition in question has been made the topic of
the Injunction, it is no longer necessary to make the denotation of the
verb the topic. Thus then, the topical character having been wrested by
the Prohibition, what is denoted by the verb naturally loses that
character. The performance of the act (denoted by the verb) is such that
its performance is secured through ordinary tendencies (of men); so that
for its own accomplishment it does not stand in need of being embraced
by any Injunction; and all that it needs is the capacity (and desire) of
the man to do the act; and this, act of *killing*, being got at by other
means of knowledge, establishes the man’s capacity for doing the act; so
that it is through a qualification of the man that it becomes correlated
with the sentence. Thus it is quite in keeping with the theory of words
denoting only correlated entities. The act, along with its
qualification, thus not forming the topic of this Injunction, man’s
tendency to it has to be explained as being due to ordinary wordly
causes. As a matter of fact, in the case of killing, such tendency and
motive power is present, in the form of the man’s passion; and certainly
no restrictions of gender or number pertain to passion; or the activity
might be due to the man’s hatred.

From all this it follows that the word, whose denotation does not form
the topic of the Injunction, on the ground that it is already known,
renounces its denotative power and indicates a sense that is determined
by other means of knowledge. And in as much as gender and number are
not, even by import, signified by the word, how can any significance be
attached to them? It being necessary to speak of what is denoted by the
basic noun, it has to be spoken of with the help of some number and it
cannot be used entirely by itself; and it is for this reason that gender
and number are added.

On the point at issue thus the conclusion is as follows:

The man, who has determined to take upon himself the character of the
agent of the act of killing, is urged (by the prohibition) to what is
signified by the negative word. So that in a prohibitive sentence, no
significance need attach to the use of the Accusative ending, which
therefore may be ignored. Even sentences where we find the Instrumental
Ending, or even the Nominative—*e.g*., ‘wine shall not be drunk by the
Brāhmaṇa’, or ‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not drink wine’,—what is denoted by
them being already got at from other sources, they do not form topics of
the Injunction; and hence they are taken as spoken of only by way of
reference. In the case where the Accusative comes in as a qualification
of the motive, the Nominative and the Instrumental endings are always
taken along with the Accusative. Even when the Accusative is directly
used, that which is not already known from other sources forms part of
the enjoined (predicate), and, as such, is regarded as duly significant;
for example in the case of such texts, as ‘*bhāryām upagacchet*’ (‘one
should have recourse to his wife’), ‘*apatayam utpādayet*’ (‘one should
beget a child’) \[where due significance attaches to the singular number
in ‘wife’ and ‘child’\]. The ‘wife’ is not a a thing acquired in the
ordinary worldly manner; as she can be acquired only by means of the
marriage-rites. Nor is it a thing that has been definitively described
in an Injunction, which would strictly restrict it to what is enjoined
therein; as there is in the case of such texts as —‘*āśvinam grahṇāti*’
(‘holds the cup dedicated to the Aśvins’), ‘*maitrāvaruṇam grāhṇāti*
(‘holds the cup dedicated to Mitra-Varuṇa’), and
‘*daśaitānadhvaryurgṛhṇāti*’ (‘the Adhvaryu holds these then’) \[where
the exact character of the cups has been prescribed by the texts laying
down the dedication\], and the cups taken up are of the precise number
mentioned in the texts; consequently, their number being known, they
become connected with the in junction of the *washing*, in sequential
accordance with that number. Now in this case, there being no other
sentence, and the sentence in question itself being the originative
injunction, there are no grounds for rejecting the directly expressed
*number*; so that any rejection of what is expressed by the
self-sufficient denotative power of words could proceed only from the
mind of man. Similarly in the case of the text ‘*paśunā yajeta*’ (‘one
should sacrifice with an animal’), the Injunction pertains to the
*sacrifice*, which is of the nature of something to be accomplished; so
that when we proceed to seek for the means by which it could be
accomplished, all that is mentioned in the injunctive text,
qualification and all, comes to be regarded as the object of the
Injunction; specially because the function of the Injunction cannot be
regarded as having been fully fulfilled only by the laying down of what
is signified by the root ‘*yaji*’, ‘to sacrifice’; why, then, should not
the words be taken in the sense that is indicated by their own
denotation as helped by the denotation of other words connected with
them?

Persons versed in the science of “Pramāṇas” however regard the text as a
self-sufficient Injunction; and in this they only repeat what has been
said by other people. What we have said is easily understandable; and it
does not demand any very keen acumen to grasp it. It is the very essence
of things. The science is useful only so far as the Injunction is
concerned; anything more than that is a mere show of learning, a purely
exaggerated description. Such description is of use only in a case where
the Injunction does not supply all the information needed; as for
instance, in the case of the injunction regarding the ‘laying of
pebbles’, there being several articles such as butter, oil, salt and the
like, that are helpful towards wetting,—it being doubtful as to which of
these is to be used in the wetting of the ‘pebbles’, it is the
description (of Butter as ‘longevity itself’) which leads to the
conclusion that Butter should be used. Or again, in the case of the
‘*Ratri-sattra*’, the performance of sacrificial rites during the night
being unheard of anywhere else, the subsequent description of the ‘men
obtaining honour’ helps to indicate the propriety of such performance by
one who is desirous of acquiring honour or fame. In the case in question
however the sentence (which in Adh. 11, verses 92 *etc*. prohibit wine
for the Brāhmaṇa) is complete in all respects, at the mention of
‘*Brāhmaṇas*’; so that all needs having been fulfilled, the only purpose
served by the description is ‘commendation.’ It might be argued that
what is said under 11.96 is treated on the same footing as the assertion
that ‘the sinful man comes by accomplished happiness’,—so that the
prohibition of wine-drinking comes to have a footing, though a partial
one, as referring to the male only. But there would be no force in this;
because *females* also are entitled to partake of the butter and other
substances, which have been left after the offerings to the Gods have
been made; and they are permitted to recite Vedic texts also at the
Darśa-pūrṇamāsa and other sacrifices; such texts, for instance, as
‘*videyakarmāsi*, &c., &c.’ Even such Injunctions as ‘one should make
the performer of *Śrāddhas* drink wine’ indicate that wine is permitted
for women.

Nor is any such distinction (between *male* and *female*) made in the
case of ‘Brāhmaṇa-killing.’ So that upon the question here raised, the
final conclusion is that the prohibition of winedrinking pertains to the
whole caste—(89).

Some people think that the term ‘*his own*’ qualifies the ‘Teacher’
only; and it serves to exclude the Teacher’s Teacher, would be thought
of as deserving the same treatment, according to what has been said
above under 2.205.

Others again explain ‘his own’ as standing for one’s *relations*.

But in this latter case, it would seem unnecessary to mention the
‘father’ and the ‘mother.’ But it may be explained as emphasising the
obligatory character of the rule as regards these particular
*relations*.

‘*Monitor*’, ‘*Guru*’,—is one who has been described in 2.149.

There is no harm done to his observances by carrying the dead body of
these persons; and what the text means by this specification is that
there is interference in the observances by the carrying of the dead
bodies of persons other than these—(90).

The term ‘*City*’ stands for the village &c. also.

The *Śūdra* has been mentioned first, because it is an inauspicious
subject. And this reversal of the order indicates that the term
‘*respectively*’ indicates that the *Vaiśya* should be carried by the
western, the *Kṣatriya* by the northern and the *Brāhmaṇa* by the
Eastern gate.—(91)

Though the terra ‘*rājan*’, ‘king’, is denotative of the
*Kṣatriya-caste*, yet, on account of the reason being stated in the
words that ‘they occupy the position of sovereigns’, it follows that it
indicates the ruler of countries. This we shall explain fully under the
next verse.

‘*Those who are keeping a vow*;’—*i.e*., those who are observing a vow,
and undergoing such penances as those of the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ and the
like.

‘*Performers of sacrificial sessions*;’—*i.e*., those who are performing
the ‘*Gavāmayana*’ sacrifice, or those who have been initiated for the
other sacrifices also. Says Gautama (14.1)—‘For sacrificial priests, for
one who has been initiated and for the Student.’

In support of this we have the laudatory statement (in the second line).
‘*Position of Sovereigns*;’—*i.e*., the kings—‘*occupy*,’—maintain,—The
‘*position*’—place—‘*of* *sovereigns*’—of rulers of men; and the other
two—the keepers of vows and performers of sacrificial sessions—have
attained the character of Brahman.

‘*Taint of uncleanliness*’— *i.e*., impurity.

Others have explained the term ‘*Sattriṇaḥ*’ to mean persons who are
constantly making gifts. But in its primary denotation, the term refers
to a particular form of sacrifice.—(92).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.48).—(Same as Manu.)

*Gautama* (14.1.45-46).—‘The *Sapiṇḍas* become impure by the death of a
relative during ton days, except those who are officiating as priests,
who have performed the initiatory sacrifice and the religious student.
Kings remain always pure, lest their business be impeded,—also the
Brāhmaṇa, lest his daily study of the Veda be interrupted.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.1).—‘Referring to deaths and births, they declare
that the impurity of *Sapiṇḍas* lasts ten days; except for officiating
priests, men who have performed the initiatory ceremony of the
Soma-Sacrifice, and students of the Veda.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.48-55).—‘Nor do kings become impure, while engaged in the
discharge of their duties, nor devotees fulfilling a vow; nor sacrifices
engaged in a sacrificial performance; nor workmen while engaged in their
work; nor those who perform the king’s orders, if the king desires them
to be pure; nor can impurity arise during the installation of the
monument of a deity, nor during a marriage ceremony, if those ceremonies
have already begun; nor when the whole country is afflicted with a
calamity; nor in times of public distress.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.27.28).—‘For officiating priests, for those initiated
for a sacrifice, for those engaged in sacrificial work, for those
engaged in a sacrificial session, for the religious student, for the
person engaged in charities, for the knower of Brahman,—also during a
marriage, during the giving of charities, during a sacrifice, during
war, in times of public distress, and in times of great
trouble,—purification is instantaneous.’

*Parāśara* (3.20-22).—‘Mechanics, artists, physicians, slaves and
slave-girls, barbers, kings and Vedic scholars have been declared to be
such as are purified instantaneously; so also the man keeping a penance,
one engaged in a sacrificial session and the twice-born person who has
taken the Fires. There is no impurity for the king, or for the person
for whom the king desires it to cease, or one who is going to engage in
battle, or in a charity, or one who is in distress, or the Brāhmaṇa who
has been invited.’

*Ādipurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 615).—‘The work done by the painter and
other artists is such as is not known to others; hence in the doing of
their own work, they are always pure. The work that is done by the cook
is such as is not known to others; hence the cook is always pure. What
is done by the physician cannot be done by any one else; hence for
purposes of touching, the physician is always pure. The work that the
male and the female slaves do with ease, no one else can do; hence they
are always pure. The work that the king does—how can any one even dream
of doing? Such being the case the king is always pure, in the matter of
births and deaths. The driving of elephants and such other works as are
done by the royal servants cannot be done by others; hence these are
always pure.’

*Pracetas* (Do.).—‘Mechanics, artists, physicians, male and female
slaves, kings and royal servants are declared to be such as become
purified instantaneously.’

*Vṛddha-Parāśara* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 616).—‘There is no impurity for
kings, or for religious students, persons engaged in sacrificial
sessions, persons initiated for a sacrifice, and all those for whom the
king wishes it There is no impurity due to birth or death, for those
engaged in penance or charity.’

*Hārīta* (Do., p. 617.).—‘The Kṣatriya engaged in battle, the Vaiśya
seated among cows, the Brāhmaṇa engaged in a sacrificial session and the
religious student are always pure.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.).—‘There is no impurity during marriage or sacrifice
or trouble or journey or pilgrimage.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘In the installation of a god’s image, in the
performance of a communal sacrifice, during Śrāddha and such rites, or
during *Pitṛyajña*, or in the giving away of the daughter,—there is no
impurity.’

*Aṅgiras* (Do.).—‘There is no impurity due to birth or death on three
occasions—during a sacrificial performance, during marriage and during a
sacrifice to gods.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 919).—‘After the Initiatory Ceremony at a
sacrifice, and during the performance of the *Kṛcchra* and other
penances, there is no impurity, even on the death of the father. The
impurity comes after the completion of the performance and lasts for
three days. So also for religious students.’

*Jābāla* (Do., p. 920).—‘For the religious student, the king, the
ascetic, the artist, the initiated person, during a sacrifice or
marriage or a sacrificial session,—there is no impurity,’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘For the priest who has accepted the Honey-mixture
in connection with a sacrificial performance, if a cause for impurity
arises, it dues not apply to him. So also for the person who has been
initiated for a sacrifice, till the Final Bath. Nor is there any
impurity for the calm ascetic firm in Vedānta, etc., etc.’

‘*Majestic*’—*i.e*., that seat whose character is grand, glorious; this
‘majesty’ consists in the fact that it is seated upon this throne that
the man is enable to carry on the work of protecting the people; and
herein lies his sovereignty over men. This is what is meant by the
clause—‘*and the reason for this lies in his occupying that position*’;
and what this means is that mere caste does not entitle the man to the
consideration that the rule implies; what entitles him to it is his work
of protecting the people. The term ‘*āsana*’, ‘*position*,’ also does
not mean here a *seat* or a *couch*; it stands for the duties incumbent
upon one who takes his seat upon it. It is for this reason that the
older writers have explained the present rule to mean that there is no
impurity in the case of any person who is capable of protecting the
people, even if he be a *non-Kṣatriya* by caste.

‘*For the purpose of protecting the people*.’—The meaning of this is
that all the observances relating to impurity are not to cease, but only
those that would be incompatible with the proper fulfilment of his duty
of protecting the people; for example, the giving of food-grains out of
his granary during times of scarcity, and so forth, the performance of
rites for the allaying of celestial, atmospheric and terrestrial
portents. Further, it becomes incumbent upon the king to attend to such
business as may be brought up suddenly by gentlemen; or, when it becomes
necessary for him to speak out for the purpose of settling disputes and
religious doubts that may arise among twice-born persons in the higher
stages of life.—(93).

(Verse 94 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.27), in support of the view,
that the rule that ‘no impurity attaches to the king’ holds only with
regard to such acts of making gifts, receiving and honouring people and
hearing suits as are essential for the safety of the people; and it does
not apply to the performance of the ‘Five Great Sacrifices’ and other
religious acts.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 616);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(p. 70), which explains ‘*māhātmika sthāna*’ as the *seat of judgement*,
in connection with which there can be no impurity;—and in *Hāralatā* (p.
110) which explains the meaning to be ‘for the king who is occupying
*the position of God, the Lord of all things*’, ‘*māhātmikasthāna*’,
there is immediate purification,—not so for one who has lost his
kingdom; as the ground for the immediate cessation of impurity lies in
the fact that he occupies the judgment seat when he comes to the work of
administering justice and protecting the people.’

‘*Ḍimba*’, ‘*Riot*’, is fighting done by many people, without weapons;
‘*Āhava*’ is battle.

In the case of persons killed in these, there is immediate purification.

‘*Lightning*’—This has been already explained.

‘*Pārthiva*’—the lord of the Earth, who may belong to any of the four
castes.

Also in the case of one who, even apart from battle, has been killed in
water, or by tusked animals,—for the sake of cows and *Brāhmaṇas*.

‘*Also for the person for whom the King desires it*;’—*i.e*. the person
who has been deputed by him to do a definite work.

*Question*:—“Why should this be so? In the case of the king himself,
immediate purification has been ordained only in reference to his work
of protecting the people; how then could the impurity of any and every
person, without any restriction, cease merely by the king’s desire?”

\[The answer to this is supplied by the next two verses\].—(94).

(Verse 95 of others.)

‘*Dimbāhava*’—a riot, or a fight without weapons (Medhātithi);—infants’
(Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 916), as laying down additional
cases for ‘immediate purity’; it explains ‘*dimbāhava*,’ as ‘weaponless
fight’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 317), which takes
‘*āhavahata*,’ ‘killed in battle’ and remarks that this refers to
persons who have been killed ‘when fleeing from battle’, as otherwise
there would be no justification for the offerings to the dead described
in the Mahābhārata.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Gautama* (14.9-12).—‘The relations of those who are slain for the sake
of cows and Brāhmaṇas become pure immediately; also those of men
destroyed by the anger of the king; of those killed in battle; likewise
those of men who voluntarily die by starving themselves, by weapons,
fire, poison or water, by hanging themselves or by jumping from a
precipice.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.47, 52).—‘The relatives of those who have been killed by
jumping from a precipice, or by fire or by fasting, or by water, in
battle, by lightning, or by the king, do not become impure; nor those
who perform the king’s orders, if the king wishes them to he pure.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 907).—‘The relatives of those killed in a riot, or
those of suicides, or of those who have been drowned in river or killed
by wild animals, become purified instantaneously.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘For the relations of those killed in rots, or by
lightning, or by the king, or in the saving of cows and Brāhmaṇas, they
have declared instantaneous purification; but some sages have declared
that the impurity lasts three days.’

*Parāśara* (3.29-30).—‘For the relations of persons who have died for
the sake of Brāhmaṇas, or in the saving of prisoners or cows, and those
who have died in battle, the impurity lasts for one night.’

*Sumantu* (Aparārka, p. 917).—‘For those killed by jumping from a
precipice, or by ûre or water, or in battle,—those who die in foreign
lands, the renunciate—those killed by fasting, those killed by
lightning, or those who have committed suicide by going on the Great
Journey,—water-offerings may be made, and the purification is
instantaneous.’

*Kāśyapa* (Do.).—‘The relations of those killed by fasting or by
lightning, or by entering fire or water, by fall from a precipice, or in
battle, or in foreign land,—or of embryos, or of infants that have
teethed,—are purified in three nights.’

‘*Śastra*’, ‘*weapon*’, is that by which people are slain, killed; hence
by the present rule, also for the man who is killed by pieces of stone
or a club or such other things, sacrificial performances become
completed.

‘*Āhava*’, ‘Battle is so called because in this men are *challenged*
(*āhūyante*) to fight, through mutual rivalry.

‘*Manner befitting the Kṣatriya*;—*i.e*., never turning his
back,—fighting in the defence of his people, or under orders from his
master.

‘*Sacrificial performances*’—such as the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest;—‘*become instantly completed*’—finished. That is, the man becomes
endowed with the merit proceeding from the due performance of the
sacrifices.

Impurity also in their case is the same; *i.e*. it ceases immediately.

Some people construe the term ‘*sadyaḥ*’, ‘*instantly*’, with the word
‘*killed*’; and according to this what is said here would apply to the
case of only that man who actually dies on this battle-field, and not to
one who is moved away from there and dies on some other day.

This point however is open to question.—(97).

After the completion of the prescribed period of impurity—of ten days,
&c.—there is something more that has got to be done.

‘*Touching Water*’ stands for *bathing*, as we have already explained
before.

‘*After he* *has* *performed the rite*.’—This goes with the *Kṣatriya*
and the other two that follow; and the ‘rite’ meant is only *bathing*,
none other being found to have been prescribed. The meaning thus is
that, ‘having bathed, they should touch the conveyance and other
things.’

Others however explain the term ‘*rite*’ as standing for the *Śrāddha
ceremonies*; the meaning being that all become pure after having
performed the *Śrāddha-ceremonies*, but the *Brāhmaṇa* after he has
‘touched water’, and the *Kṣatriya* and the rest after touching the
conveyance and other things.—(98).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 99 of others.)

‘*Apaḥ spṛṣṭvā*’.—‘Having touched water; *i.e*., having bathed’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘washed hands’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.29), which adds the following
explanation:—‘*Kṛtakriyaḥ*’ should be construed with each of the four
terms, ‘*vipraḥ*’, ‘*kṣattriyaḥ*’, ‘*vaiśyaḥ*’ and ‘*śūdraḥ*’; the
meaning being—‘the Brāhmaṇa, having passed through the period of
impurity, having performed the rites, and having bathed, becomes pure by
touching water with his hands;’ the term ‘*spṛṣṭvā*’ is to be taken in
its literal sense of *touching*, and not in that of either *bathing* or
*sipping water*; as it is only the former that would be compatible with
the ‘conveyance and weapons’;—it suggests also another
explanation:—‘*kṛtakriyaḥ*’, ‘after having duly made the offerings of
water and other things during the period of impurity, the Brāhmaṇa
becomes pure by touching water, this being a substitute for the bathing
which is ordained for ending all forms of impurity; and the *kṣatriya*
becomes pure by touching the conveyance and weapons and so forth.’

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 427);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
278), which says that “according to *Mitākṣarā*, ‘*kṛtakriyaḥ*’ means
‘having bathed at the end of the period of impurity’”—also in II, p. 337
where it refers to the same opinion of *Mitākṣarā* and quotes *Hāralatā*
as explaining the term to mean ‘having performed the rites of the tenth
day;’—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 154), which explains ‘*kṛtakriyaḥ*’ as ‘who
has finished the rites of the tenth day’;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 194) which
explains ‘*kṛtakriyaḥ*’ as ‘who has completed the rites of the tenth
day’, and ‘*apaḥ spṛṣṭvā*’ as standing for the mere *touching of water*,
and not for *bathing*, ‘*pratoda*’ as ‘what is known as *pāñcnī*,
‘*raśmi*’ as the yoking-rope and ‘*yaṣṭi*’ as the ‘bamboo stick and so
forth’;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 226), which explains ‘*kṛtakriyaḥ*’
as one ‘who has performed’ the bath and other ceremonies at the end of
the period of impurity.

<details><summary>Bühler</summary>

099	(At the end of the period of impurity) a Brahmana who has performed the necessary rites, becomes pure by touching water, a Kshatriya by touching the animal on which he rides, and his weapons, a Vaisya by touching his goad or the nose-string (of his oxen), a Sudra by touching his staff.

(Verse 101 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.14), which deduces the
following conclusions from this and the next verse:—If, through
affection for the dead, one after having carried the dead body, lives in
the house and takes his food there, then he remains impure for ten
days;—if he remains in the house but takes no food there, the impurity
lasts for three days;—if he only carries the body, but neither remains
in the house nor takes food here, then the impurity lasts for one day
only;—in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p.17);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 220);—in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 59), which explains ‘*bandhuvat*’ as ‘through
affection and adds that if it is done merely as a meritorious act, then
there is mere bathing.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 413), which notes that the rule
pertains to the carrying of the dead body of a person belonging to the
same caste as oneself;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 631), which
deduces the same conclusions as *Mitākṣarā*, and adds that it refers to
the dead of the Brāhmaṇa’s own caste; for those of different castes, the
rule is laid down by Gautama, that the impurity is to be regulated
according to the rules pertaining to that caste;—and in *Smṛtitattva*
(II, p. 293), which explains ‘*bandhuvat*’ to mean ‘through affection’,
and deduces the same conclusions as *Mitākṣarā*, and adds that in the
case of ‘relations’ if one carries the dead body only with a view to
acquiring spiritual merit, the man remains impure for *three days*, even
though he may not live in the house or take his food there.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 883), which adds that from the rest of
the verse it is clear that what is said here applies only to that case
where one does not take his food in the house of the dead;—in *Hāralatā*
(p. 82), which has the following notes:—‘*nirhṛtya*,’ ‘having carried
and burnt,’—‘*bandhuvat*,’ through affectionate regard;—this implies
that if it is done by way of helping a helpless person, then this rule
is not applicable,—‘*māturāptān*,’ uterine brother or sister or maternal
uncle and so forth;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 320) which adds
that this rule applies to ages other than the Kali.

immediately by bathing; on carrying and burning the dead body of a
Brāhmaṇa who has no *sagotra* and no relations, one becomes purified by
breath-suspension.’

*Aṅgiras* (Panlśaramadhava, p. 631).—‘If one somehow carries the dead
body of one who is not his *sapiṇḍa*, he becomes pure the same day by
bathing in his clothes and touching fire.’

not sleep or eat in the house of a person under impurity, he is impure

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.26), which explains ‘*jñāti*’
as ‘mother’s sapiṇḍa’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 918), which adds that this
applies to one who follows the dead body intentionally, and not to one
who happens to go with it by mere chance;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 212).

This verse is quoted in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 22), which explains
‘*jñāti*’ as ‘one belonging to the same caste,’ *not* a *sapiṇḍa*, and
adds that ‘eating of butter’ means fasting.

It is quoted in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 225), which explains ‘*jñāti*’ as
‘mother’s sapiṇḍa’;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 332);—in *Hāralatā* (p.
86) which has the, following notes:—‘*Pretam*,’ a Brāhmaṇa dead,—if one
intentionally follows he becomes pure by touching fire and eating not
butter, this is what is meant, and *not* that the impurity ceases on
this alone, because even without following the dead body, the death of a
relative involves an impurity for ten days; the following of a
non-relative (‘ajñāti’) however involves only the touching of fire and
eating of butter, and no further impurity.

One should not have a dead Brāhmaṇa carried by a Śūdra, while his own people are there. For it would be an oblation into fire, defiled by the touch of the Śūdra, and as such not conducive to heaven.—(l 03).

‘*Have carried*’—have taken out.

‘*While his own people are there*’—*i.e*., men of the same caste. The
use of the term ‘*oblation into fire*’ implies that the body should not
also be burnt by the *Śūdra*.

The specification of the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is not emphasised; for the
*Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* also the Śūdra’s touch is defiling; hence
what the supplementary statement indicates is that the prohibition
applies to the case of these two also.—(103).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 104 of others.)

According to Nārāyaṇa this rule is meant for Brāhmaṇas only; but
Medhātithi says that the ‘*vipra*’ is mentioned only by way of
illustration; the rule applies to all the three higher castes.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.20);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 634), which reproduces the remark made in *Mitākṣarā* that
the phrase ‘*sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu*’ is superfluous, in view of the assertion
(in the second half) that the touching of the body by the lower castes
is ‘*asvargya*,’ which would imply that the body should not be so
touched, irrespective of the presence or absence of the dead person’s
‘own people’;—and in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 17).

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 395), which also adds the same
remark;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 120) which says —‘*sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu*’ means
that if possible the dead body of a Brāhmaṇa should be carried by
Brāhmaṇas alone, in the absence of Brāhmaṇas by Kṣatriyas, even by
Vaiśyas in the absence of Kṣatriyas, and by Śūdras only when there are
no Vaiśyas—‘*asvargyā*,’ this also refers to cases where twice-born
persons are available.
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Viṣṇu* (19.1).—‘One must not cause a dead member of a twice-born caste
to be carried by a Śūdra; nor a Śūdra by a twice-born person.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 634).—‘When a sacrificer dies, the Śūdra
shall not carry his dead body; that dead person for whom the Śūdra
carries fire, grass or wood, remains a *ghost* for ever and becomes
defiled by sin.’

‘*Wisdom*’ and the rest are mentioned only by way of illustrating the
purification by lapse of time; the sense being—‘just as these are the
means of purification within their own spheres, so is *Time* also, and
the efficacy of this latter should not be doubted.’

Of the several things mentioned here, what is efficatious under what
circumstances shall be explained in the present context itself; and the
efficacy of other things shall be described in particular places.

‘*Wisdom*’—spiritual knowledge; such as is taught by the *Sāṅkhya-Yoga*.
This serves to set aside Ignorance, and removes attachment and other
impediments, whereupon wisdom becomes free from all defects. This is
what is going to be described under 108, where it is said—‘Intellect
becomes purified by wisdom.’

‘*Austerity*;’—the *Kṛcchra*, the *Cāndrāyaṇa* and the rest. This serves
to remove the taint of major and minor sins.

‘*Fire*’—is the means of purification of earthen-ware vessels and such
other things as have been mentioned as being ‘purified by
re-baking’(121).

‘*Food*;’—*i.e*., the eating of such pure things as milk and roots.

This also serves to purify in the same manner as Austerity.

The fact of ‘*clay*’ and ‘*water*’ being the means of purification is
well-known, That of the ‘*mind*’ is going to be described under 108.

‘*Smearing*;’—*i.e*., cleaning and whitewashing with such things as
cowdung, lime and the like.

‘*Wind*’— purifies pieces of grass and wood lying on the roads, which
happen to be touched by the *cāṇḍāla* and such others.

‘*Actions*;’—e. g., the saying of Twilight Prayers and such other rites.
It has been declared under 2.102 that ‘one should stand saying the
morning prayers, thus he removes the sin committed, during the
night’;—what this means we have explained under Discourse II.

Though ‘Austerity’ also is an ‘action’, it has been mentioned separately
for the purpose of emphasising its importance. In fact, in the
srciptures ‘Austerity’ is generally mentioned separately; *e.g*. in
Yājñavalkya, Ācāra 221—‘*Karmaniṣṭhāstaponiṣṭhāḥ*’—(104)

purification. For those who do what should not he done, charity is the
means of purification; the river is purified by its current; of things
requiring purification, it is brought about by clay and water; for the
twice-born, renunciation is the purifier; for Vedic scholars,
austerities; for the learned, tolerance; for the body, water; for those

Those who are learned are purified by tolerance; ‘they are never
affected by hatred, jealousy or ill-will; hence even when sin is
rampant, they remain ever pure. ‘Tolerance’ is the property of the Mind
which consists in having the same consideration for all.

Of ‘liberality’ also the efficacy in removing the sin of doing what
sought not to be done has been described under 11.139, where it is
declared that ‘murder is wiped off by charity’.

In the section dealing with ‘secret sins’ also it has been declared that
for the expiation of secret sins, one should repeat the sacred texts.

For persons well-versed in the Veda, ‘*austerity*’; which, in their
case, consists in repeating the Vedic texts and also cultivating
knowledge; as it has been declared that—‘for the Brāhmaṇa, learning is
the real austerity’ (11.235). As regards the ‘*kṛcchra*’ and other
penances, they are, means of purification for all men, not only for
those versed in the Veda.—(106).

When the banks of a river with water shallowed down becomes defiled by
unclean things, its water becomes purified by the current of the same
river, when it has regained its current strong enough to demolish its
sides. The brinks of rivers are not purified in the manner in which
other ground is purified “by means of five things” (Verse 123).

Or, it may be that the text has declared that ‘the river is purified by
its current’ in view of the idea that people may have in regard to the
river having become defiled on account of un clean things flowing along
its current; and the meaning is that it should not be thought that,
inasmuch as the river has become contaminated by the flowing along of
unclean things coming from all sides, it can never, become pure.

The woman who has not been found to have had carnal intercourse with any
man, but continues to think of the beauty and good qualities of other
men, is regarded as ‘*of undean mind*’, and such a woman becomes
purified by ‘*menstruation*’; *i.e*.,; by the flow of blood during her
courses.

‘*Renunciation*’ shall be described in Discourse VI, and by this are
Brāhmaṇas purified. And no mere mental process removes the sin that
they, in their ignorance, may have committed in the shape of having
entertained thoughts for the killing of small insects and so
forth.—(107).

(Verse 108 of others.)

This verse is quoted in ‘*Parāśaramādhava*’ (Ācāra, p. 536), which adds
the following notes:—Some people have understood the last quarter of the
verse to mean that it is the Brāhmaṇa only, not the Kṣatriya or the
Vaiśya, that is entitled to ‘Renunciation’; and in support of this there
are several *Śruti* and *Smṛti* texts.—Others however have held that all
the four stages are meant for all the twice-born persons; and the texts
that prohibit Renunciation for the *non-* *Brāhmaṇa* should be
understood as prohibiting only the wearing of the dull red garment and
the taking of the staff (which have been laid down in connection with
the life of the Renunciate).

The verse is also quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 116), in
support of the view that the woman’s sin of evil intentions is removed
by her menstruation—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 249);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 792);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 13b).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ‘personality’ entitled to the performance of acts consists of the
following factors—

1.  The person himself, *i.e*., the Inner Soul,
2.  the Internal Organ, *i.e*., the mind,
3.  the Intellect
4.  and the Body, the receptacle of experiences.

The Sense-Organs being material, do not constitute a separate factor. Of
these factors some are purified by one thing, and some by other; the
statement that ‘Time purifies everything’ being purely valedic tory.

‘*Limbs*,’ standing for the parts, indicate the *whole*, the *body*; the
sense being that ‘by water’—*i.e*., by bathing—‘the body becomes
purified.’

The ‘mind’—described (in Discourse I) as consisting of ‘the existent and
the non-existent’—becomes contaminated by evil intentions; and it
becomes pure by ‘*truthfulness*’—*i.e*., by good intentions. In a
previous verse (104) the mind has been spoken of as a ‘means of
purification’; but that has to be taken in an indirect sense; and the
present text can not mean that ‘words’ (truthful) are the means of
purifying the mind; and the Śruti also speaks of ‘the *word* being
prompted by the Mind, whence the word uttered by one who is
absent-minded becomes fit for demons and not for the gods.’

‘*Learning*’—produced by the proper study of the Sāṅkhya and the
Vedānta;—and ‘*austerity*’— in the form of the *Kṛcchra* and the
rest;—when endowed by these the ‘soul proper’ becomes purified. The
term—‘*bhūta*’ (in the compound ‘*bhūtātma*’) means *proper, real*;
*i.e*., that which is really the soul, the object of the notion of the
‘ego’ as free from the notion of ‘I’, and not the material entity
consisting of the *body*.

‘*Buddhi*’ is ‘*cognition*’—which is regarded as contaminated when it
appears in the form of a thing that is non-existent, or when it does not
take any account of the distinction between the real form of the thing
cognised and the apparent form in which it is cognised when, during
dreams and such conditions, it is obsessed by wrong notions of
things;—or ‘*Buddhi*’ may stand for that faculty of the personality
which is the product of the unexpiated portions of his past misdeeds,
and which may, by virtue of each single sin committed in the past, beset
that personality in the form of Ignorance, appearing in the shape of the
notion of diversity, or in the shape of the non-discrimination between
the Soul and the material attributes, which operates in the form of
attachment to children, wealth and such things, and becomes the source
of extreme longings.—This ‘*Buddhi*’ becomes pure by ‘*know*
*ledge*;’—*i.e*., proper understanding of the means of cognition as
indicating the self-luminous character of all cognitions. *Cognition* is
distinct from the *Object cognised*, by reason of the latter having a
shape, and it being impossible for the former to become modified, into
that shape; and hence it becomes purified by the conviction that it is,
by its very nature, unmodifiable.

The term ‘learning’ in the previous clause stands for the *knowledge of
what is taught by the Veda*; and its capacity for purification is of the
same kind as described under 11.246—‘as the fire, in one moment, etc.’

Being purified in the above manner, the person reaches the regions of
Brahman. Such is the four-fold purification. And what is intended to be
expressed is eulogy of such purification as leading to the fulfilment of
the highest ends of man in the matter of his births and other
ciruumstances.—(108).

‘*Of various things*;’—*i.e*., of substances that are used by man, in
the form of products that are igneous, earthy, liquid, solid, isolated,
compact.

This verse points out the difference of what is going to be described
from the purification described above. In the foregoing Section the most
important purification was shown to be that of the Soul, that of
substances deserving attention only because of their being used by the
personality; while in the present section the reverse is the case.

‘*Listen to the rule*’.—This verse is meant to avoid the two sections
being comfounded.—(109).

     M G: candragopa-; This may be the Buddhist author Candragomin who is said to have authored a large number of texts, according to Tāranātha: "in all he composed four hundred and thirty-two separate works, of which ... one hundred and eight were treatises on secular knowledge" including "fine arts, grammar, logic, medicine, prosody, dramaturgy, dictionary, poetics, astronomy, etc." (trans. Chimpa & Chattopadhyaya, pp. 206-7). Possibly Medhātithi is noting that he did not want to follow the example of Candragomin to be too prolix.

The name ‘*Igneous substances*’ is applied to all those substances that
melt at the contact of fire; *e.g*. silver, gold, copper, iron, lead,
zinc and so forth.

^(‘)*Gems*’—things of the nature of the rock-crystal. ‘*Ashma*’ is
*stone*; and what is made of it is called ‘*ashmamaya*’.

‘*Sarvasya*,’ ‘*of everything*’—This has been added for filling up the
metre; the justification for it being found in there being two kinds of
stone—that quarried from mountains and that obtained from river-beds.

‘*By ash*’;—since both *ash* and *clay* serve the same purpose, they are
to be regarded as optional alternatives; while ‘water’ is meant to be
used along with each of these two.

“What is the use of these?”

The removing of stains and smells. It has been declared that—‘the
purification of the unclean thing consists in the removal of its stains
and smell’;—and again‘so long as from the object besmeared with an
unclean substance, the odour and stain do not pass off &c. &c.’

Both ash and clay are, by their very nature, non-greasy; hence
purification is brought about by these in the case of oily effects.

The ‘purification’ of the ‘impure’ thing consists in making it fit for
use by removing its defects.

“If this is so, then it should be necessary to describe in detail the
impurity attaching to things—in some such form as ‘such and such a
substance becomes *impure* when in contact with such and such a
substance’.—‘But these are worldly things; and all this would be known
from ordinary usage.’—Not so; because from ordinary usage, the thing is
known only in a vague general form. Further in ordinary usage what is
called ‘impure’ is only what has become disgusting by being contaminated
by urine, ordure and blood; while what is meant by ‘impure’ in the
present context is that which is *unfit for touching* &c. and it is
only from the scriptures that it could be learnt whence this unfitness
arises. Then again, a man is called *pure* when he does not fall into a
mistake in regard to what belongs to others. From all this it is clear
that no useful purpose can be served from what is thus known, from
ordinary usage, regarding the signification of the term in question.
Though it is generally known that what has been contaminated is
*impure*, yet it cannot be known by what particular thing a certain
thing becomes contaminated.—‘But how can the exact signification of a
term be ascertained from scriptures, when, ‘as a matter of fact, what
the scriptures provide is the knowledge of *what should be done*, and
not the meaning of a certain word, which latter is what is done by the
work of Pāṇini; that this is so follows from the fact that the *Smṛtis*
of Manu and others are based upon the Veda (which deals only with the
Duties of Man)’.—Our answer to this is as follows:—In the case in
question, we do infer an injunction in the form—‘one should not make use
of a substance that has become contaminated by such and such a
substance’; and there would be nothing incongruous in the notion that
the substance by whose contact the thing becomes unfit for use is the
cause of contamination. Similarly as regards *purification* also, we can
recognise its basis in some such injunction as—^(‘)when a thing has
become contaminated, it may be used after it has gone through the
prescribed process of washing &c.’; and yet such an injunction would not
mean that ‘purification should be done’. For if it did this, then, he
who would not do it would incur sin. What happens is that in the case of
ordinary secular acts, it being possible for the man in need to make use
of any kind of vessels, pure or otherwise,—the Scripture lays down the
restriction that ‘if need arises, one should make use of such vessels,
and not of others If it is to be treated as a *restriction*, then it
would be incumbent upon only one who seeks prosperity; and every other
man would be free to do as he chose; just as in connection with the
question of the correct forms of words, though the correct and incorrect
forms are both equally expressive, yet there is the restriction which
indicates that the use of the correct form brings merit, while that of
the incorrect form is sinful \[and this means that only people seeking
merit need use the correct form\].’—This would be true only if there
were no text prohibiting the use of *unclean* vessels. But when there is
such a prohibition, how could anyone make use of the vessel that has not
been purified? As for the rules regarding purification, these only
represent exceptions (to the prohibition of unclean vessels, the meaning
being, that if the unclean vessel has been purified, it may be used).
How then could there be any prosperity arising from what is a mere
*exception*? Since all that it means is that if one acts according to
the exception, he does not incur the sin of transgressing the
prohibition.

“Or again, the Smṛti may be taken as dealing with the explanation of the
meanings of words,—resembling the Smṛti that deals with the correct and
incorrect forms of words. As for the notion that ‘the works of Manu and
others have their basis in such Vedic texts as deal with the subject of
what *ought to be done*’, we ask—who has said that this is so? As a
matter of fact, our presumption of the basis for the assertions of Manu
and others depends upon the merit of each individual case. For instance,
in the case of the *Aṣṭakā*, which is of the nature of a *rite*, we
presume its basis in the form of a Vedic text enjoining what *ought to
be done*; but in a case where the assertion deals with things as they
really exist, the corresponding basic text, also must be of the same
kind, dealing with an accomplished entity. As regards the subject of the
exact meanings of words, the idea regarding the priority of a particular
denotation may always be derived from usage; as in this matter there is
no question of anything *to be done*. In the case in question however
(where there *is* a question of something *to be done*), it is not
possible to derive any knowledge from mere usage. Specially because
*purification* being something that can he brought about only by means
of Vedic texts, how could it ever be made dependent upon usage? If it
were, then all injunctions on the subject would be absolutely
futile.—‘But we have such in junctions as that of Pāṇini, to the effect
that one should make use of correct, and not incorrect, forms of words’
(where also there is no act to be done, nothing to be brought into
existence).’—This is not Pāṇini’s injunction at all; all that his rule
says is ‘this is correct, not that’; though it is true there is a rule
like what has been quoted in the works of the authors of the
*Dharmasūtras* all this may be learnt in detail from the *Abhidhānāsara*
).—‘In this Smṛti itself we find such injunctions as that—(1) claimants
to property shall divide it in such and such a manner, or that (2) the
eldest brother shall take four shares (9.153), or that (3) the eldest
brother shall take &c. &c. (9.105). The proper denotation of the
injunction has been declared to extend to *directing* and other factors
also.

In fact the denotations of the words are in the form of *injunctions*
and *direction*, and other factors are only supplementary to the
injunctions; for in all these cases the notion derived from the words is
in the form of *urging to activity* (towards a certain end).’—But what
sort of *urging* could there be in the case (1) of causes and effects,
or (2) of the pronouncing of blessings, or (3) of *opportunity* (all
which are sometimes expressed by the injunctive affix)? Nor could the
*taking* (of the four shares, mentioned in the texts just quoted) form
the object of an injunction; since it is what is liable to be done by
reason of the eldest brother being desirous of taking all he can.—‘But
the desire, of the eldest brother would lead him to take his own as well
as the other brothers’ shares, and hence the said injunction serves to
restrict what should be taken by each.’—As a matter of fact however,
there being no possibility perceptible of any one demanding more than
his prescribed share, there is no room for any restrictive
injunction.—‘Well, on account of the prohibition, the text may be taken
as a preclusive injunction.—This would be all right; but in that case,
if at the time of division itself, any of the brothers were to take
something in excess of his prescribed share, with the acquiescence of
his brothers, he would be incurring sin, even though the permission of
the brothers would be there. Nor could the text be taken as indicating
the man’s ownership over a certain share of the thing concerned; because
the coming into existence of ownership has been already mentioned in the
injunction of *receiving* one’s share; and what the prohibition does is
to point out that over everything else, apart from the prescribed share,
the man has no rights of ownership. But even so, if one were to
transgress this prohibition and take possession of an excessive share,
his ownership would certainly come into existence. It is for these same
reasons that ownership has been held to be produced even by *stealing*
and such acts. And for the time, apart from possession, no such idea is
entertained as that this man has no ownership over the thing.

“Thus then, it being found that the text in question cannot be taken
either as an Injunction, or a Restriction, or a Preclusion, all that the
*dividing* means is the apportionment of the shares—‘so much is the
share of this person und so much of that.’ Consequently the injunctive
in ‘*vibhajeran*’, ‘should divide’, must indicate *opportunity*; and
that the term ‘should take’ only refers to what actually happens in
ordinary worldly practice; just as in the injunction ‘the hungry man
should eat’, or ‘for the sake of the acquisition and safeguarding of his
property one shall seek the help of the king.’ Gautama has distinctly
enumerated (in 10.39) the sources, of ownership as—‘Inheritance,
purchase, &c., &c.’

“Thus then, since we have such direct Smṛti-injunctions as those of the
*Aṣṭakā* and the like (which are something *to be done* and hence fit
subjects for injunction), what is said in them regarding Impurity and
Purity can only be taken as laying down something that is entirely of a
sanctificatory character; and since this also has its basis in a (Vedic)
Injunction, it may be regarded as prescribed by that injunction itself.
So that it is only from the scriptures that it can be determined what is
*impurity* and what is *purity*. For this reason it is necessary that
the nature of impurity also should be fully explained.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—This has been explained under 135
below, where ‘fat, semen, &c.,’ of men have been mentioned as
constituting ‘impurities’; and the specifying of ‘men’ is only
illustrative, as is clear from other *Smṛti* -texts, of all such animals
as the dog, the cat, the ass, the camel, the monkey, the crow, the
village-hog,the village-cock, the rat, the jackal and other carnivorous
animals and birds, also nailed animals and the mungoose; and ‘fat’ and
the other things include also *the flesh* and the *hair*.

What is meant by the declaration of ‘purification’ (in the present
verse) is that whenever the substances mentioned become contaminated by
urine and such things they have to be sanctified in the manner laid
down; and this need not be done when they are to be used in their
natural condition. Because gold and other things are not *impure* by
their nature,—when alone they could need purification whenever they
would be used.

Or, the verse may be taken as laying down the purification in connection
with a visible act, but with a view to an invisible (trancendental)
result: just like the laying down of the rule that ‘one should eat
facing the East’

In this latter case however, the mention of ‘purification’ would be
incongruous.

As for the ordinary clearing and washing of vessels before eating those
are done on account of usage, and not by virtue of the Smṛti-rule
regarding purification (which pertains to only such articles as have
become defiled by the touch of the unclean thing).

As regards the other things that are ‘untouchable’ by man—such, for
instance, as the *Cāṇḍāla* and the like—or garlic, onion, wine, meat and
so forth,—these also are sources of defilement of substances.

What particular form of purification shall be used in the case of the
contamination by what unclean thing,—for this it is necessary to look
out for usage and other Smṛti-texts. Details on this point have
been.‘supplied by Hārīta, Āpastamba, Parāśara and other sages; but all
these passages we have not quoted here, for fear *of* having to write
too much, in the manner of the philosophical writer Chandragomin.—(110).

This rule applies to two particular metals, gold and silver, when they
are free from stains; as for other metals, copper and the rest, their
cleansing is to be done with washing with powdered bricks and such
things, just as in the case of their bring defiled by leavings of food.
There is no stain in a vessel in which milk or water has been drunk. As
regards the case where parts of the vessel become stained by the
leavings of meat, butter, milk and such things, the author is going to
lay down distinct means of cleansing—‘By that from which they sprang
&c.’ (113). Then again, since the text has spoken of the removal of
‘smells and stains’, we should make use of such cleansing substances as
may be capable of removing a particular stain; and it is not necessary
to make use of ash and water in all cases. Hārīta mentions several such
cleansing substances, as ‘powdered wheat, rice, peas, barley,
kidney-bean and lentil’; and he proceeds to say—‘even when gold and
silver vessels are not stained, if they have been touched by a Cāndāla,
or by a menstruating woman, they should be cleaned with ash twenty-one
times.’

Śaṅkha however has declared thus—‘Of metal vessels defiled by a dead
body or blood or semen or urine or ordure, there should be either
alteration or scrubbing or washing twenty-one times with ash’. There
should be ‘alteration’ in the case of vessels long immersed in urine
&c. ‘alteration’ means the destruction of the original name and form
and the bringing about of another shape and name;—‘scrubbing’ means
scratching with a sharp weapon or with stone.

Another Smṛti-text has prescribed’ (l) melting, (2) heating and (3)
hammering.’—When the vessel has been put into the melting-pot by the
goldsmith, it becomes pure ‘burning’, *i.e*., being pat into fire by
goldsmiths ‘hammering *i.e*., heating and then placing on the anvil and
hammering, in the melting-pot it bring declared that ‘all mines are
pure.’

‘*What is produced out of water*’—the conch-shell, the rock-crystal and
the like. For the *stained* conch-shell there is purification by the
paste of white mustard, or by cow’s-urine and water, or by milk. We read
in another *Smṛti*—‘The couch-shell is purified by water; if it is
defiled and oily, then by milk and water, and by the paste of white
mustard.’

‘*Anupaskṛtam*’ ‘*enchased*’, *i.e*., the chasings in which are not
filled (with unclean things), not very much defiled. This goes with
every one of the things mentioned; hence in the case of every one of
these being defiled with the touch of dry unclean things or of the
caṇḍāla and the like,—even though there be no stain,—the purification is
to be as described before, in accordance with other Smṛti-texts.—(111).

This is a purely commendatory description.

In the series of commendatory passages beginning with the words
‘*agnirvai varuṇam*’ and ending with ‘*abhyākāmyata*’, the origin of
gold and silver has been described; the meaning of which is that—‘Agni
approached Varuṇa, *i.e*., water, in the manner of a male approaching a
female, and had sexual intercourse with it, and out of this sprang gold
and silver.’

For this reason the purification of these is done by means of their
‘source’; *i.e*., by fire when there is much defilement, and algo by
water.

Another reading is ‘*Sayonyā*’; in which case the meaning is ‘by that
which has the same source as themselves’, *i.e*., by ash. And in
accordance with this view cleansing by means of clay is also sometimes
permitted.

The ‘*purification is best done*’.— (112).

‘*According to suitability*’.—According to what may be suitable to a
particular thing; *i.e*., that substance should be used for cleaning
which is best fitted to remove the dirt from the object to be cleaned.
It is for this reason that in another *Smṛti* we find it stated
that—‘things made of tin and lead are to be cleansed by means of
cow-dung and chaff.’ Similarly—‘Brass-articles smelt by the cow, or
defiled by the food-leavings of the Śūdra, or defiled by dogs and cows
become cleansed by means of alkaline substances.’ It is with a view to
this that we have the various varieties of alkalines, such as those
prepared out of gruel, or of pomegranates and so forth.—(113).

‘*Liquids*’—Substances that have the tendency to *flow*; *e.g*.,
clarified butter, oil, gruel and so forth; when small quantities of
these,—not more than a seer—are defiled by the cow and other
things,—their purification is done by means of, ‘*utpavana*’,—*i.e*.,
the removal or throwing away, of a portion of the original contents. In
another *Smṛti-text* it has been declared as follows:—‘Utpavana is done
by means of two blades of Kuśa, with the hymn—‘*pavamānaḥsuvarjanaḥ*,
&c.’

Others have explained ‘*utpavana*’ to mean ‘make to overflow’; the
meaning being that another similar substance is to be poured into the
defiled liquid till the vessel becomes filled to overflowing and a
portion of the liquid flows out.

What is here prescribed is to be done in the case of direct
contamination.

In the case of small quantities, the liquid has to be thrown away.

When, on the other hand, it is the vessel that is contaminated—and there
is no direct defilement of the liquid itself—it should be removed into
another vessel. In the case of liquids becoming contaminated by the
contact of food-leavings, it has been declared ‘clarified butter should
be placed in water and Vedic mantras recited’; and it is clear that the
things have to be poured into another vessel, which latter is to be
placed in water; for if the oil itself were placed in water, it would
not remain fit for use. Similarly in the case of clarified butter also.

The said ‘*utpavana*’ is meant for *liquids*. But when liquids come into
contact with urine and other unclean things, to this extent that their
own odour and colour cease to be perceptible,—they have to be thrown
away.

As regards such liquids as have been boiled, Śaṅkha has prescribed
*re-boiling* also.

This same purification pertains to even urine and other unclean liquids,
when they are to be used by the Śūdra and others. But in this case
‘*utpavana*’ would mean only ‘overflowing’. As Vaśiṣṭha has said—‘for
things on the ground it is like water’.

^(‘)*Solids*’—hard substances; such as cooled clarified butter, curds,
sugar-candy, cakes and the like. In the ease of these, if the portion
that is defiled is thrown away, the remainder becomes purified. Śaṅkha
has declared—‘In the case of dry substances, by the removal of
contamination’.

Or, the term ‘*saṃhatāḥ*’ may stand for things composed of several
components; such as, couch, seat, bed and the like, which are
composites, composed of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous
constituents.

But in all cases, purification is obtained by the removal of
contamination.

In the case of contact with a dead body, or with unclean things that
have dried up, that part which has come into direct contact with such
things is to be washed and the rest of the thing is to be sprinkled with
water.

In the case of *wooden articles*—*i.e*., things made of wood only, such
us a scat, a board and the like made of wood—if these are contaminated
by the touch of a dead body, or a *cāṇḍāla* or Śūdra,—there should be
*scraping*.

Others hold that scraping is to be done only when the thing touches
*Ordure*; in which case, the stain and the smell have got to be removed
by scraping, and the rest of the thing is to be washed and sponged with
clay and water.

On contamination by a dog and such things, there should be washing, as
in the case of *ordure*.

In the case of the wooden bed and such things made up of wood and ropes
&c (and not of wood *only*), purification is secured as in the ease of
‘solids’ or ‘composites’.—(114).

These two verses are to be taken as citing examples in illustration of
what has been laid down in the *Śruti*.

When the cups, the spoons and other sacrificial vessels have been used
in one performance, they become smeared with clarified butter and other
offering-materials employed at that performance; and with a view to
avoid the contamination of the fresh performance by such stains and
smearings, these have to be removed by means of hot water; and this
cleansing has to be done in the manner prescribed for each case:
sometimes by hand, sometimes by kuśa-grass, sometimes by the threads at
the end of one’s garment, and so on.

The purification here mentioned is in connection with sacrificial
performances; in the event of the vessels becoming defiled with
food-leavings etc., the cleaning is to be done in the same manner as in
the case of ordinary vessels. In as much as we have the Vedic
declaration—‘they do not become unclean by Soma’.—it is understood that
in the case of other defilements, the ordinary purification is to be
done.

The exact shapes of the ‘*graha*’ the ‘*chamasa*’ and the ‘*sphya*’ are
to be ascertained from persons versed in sacrificial lore.—(115-116).

Grains are declared as to be regarded to be ‘in large quantities’ when
they are more than one ‘*droṇa*’ in weight (about thirty-two seers).
Others hold that they are to be regarded as ‘much’ in relation to
particular men and to particular time and place; *e.g*., for one who is
in a poor condition, even a ‘*kudava*’ (a quarter seer) may be ‘much’;
similarly under certain conditions, grain is regarded as ‘much’, only
when there is a large accumulation. Says Baudhāyana (*Dharmasūtra*
1.5.47)—‘One shall employ the method of purification after having duly
considered the place, time, the man himself, the substance, the use to
which ft is going to be put, its origin and condition.’

Some people would apply the same rule to *cloth* also.

Though things have been declared to be ‘many’ when they are three and
more, yet, since the text has used the *plural* number in the term
‘*alpānām*’, ‘*those in s* *mall* *quantities*’, we take it that upto
(and including three), they are to be regarded as of ‘small quantity’.

‘*With water*’ (in the second time)—This is purely illustra tive; hence
the doth is to be washed with that liquid which may be able to remove
the contamination that has defiled it. This has been already explained
before. The term ‘*sprinkling*’ has been used for the purpose of
emphasising the use of water, the sense being that‘the sprinkling is to
be done with *water* only.’ It is on account of this difference that the
term ‘*with water*’ has been used twice.

If even by washing the stain in the cloth does not go, then that much of
it should be cut off, or the whole should be cut off,—as laid down by
Gautama (1-33).—(117).

what is indicated by ‘*bahūnām*’ ‘large quantities’, is that quantity

‘*Leather*’,—*i.e*., goat-skins and such other skins as are touchable;
and not the skin of the dog, the jackal or such animals as are by their
nature unclean.

The same rule holds good regarding also things made of the said leather,
in the shape of shoes, armour and the like.

In the present context, wherever Che original constituent cause is
mentioned, it includes the product also; and *vice versa*. So that the
rule laid down in connection with ‘wooden articles’ is applicable to
*wood* also. Vaśiṣṭha, having described the purification of wooden
articles, proceeds to speak of ‘wood, bone and earth’; and if the cause
did not include its product, how could the author apply the purification
(prescribed for *wooden articles*) and not for w *ood* ) to the *wood*?
In fact the inclusion of the product by the cause is only right, since
the notion of the latter does not certainly cease in regard to the
former.

‘*Vaidala*’ stands for the *bark of trees* and other like things.

In another *Smṛti-text* this same purification in laid down for
feathers, *kuśa*, skins, *chowries*, grass, cane, hair, and
tree-bark’—Here ‘feather’ stands for the *peacock’s feathers*, and
things made of them, such as umbrellas, hair ornaments and so forth;—the
term ‘*pavitra*’ stands for *kuśa*, and also for doth made of
*kuśa*;—the term ‘*grass*’ stands for *palm-leaves*; according to the
assertion that ‘the palm is known as the *king among plants*’; and the
part of the wood (*i.e*., ‘*ṭrna*’, which is part of ‘*tṛṇarāja*’)
denotes the whole, like the term ‘*deva*’ denoting the name
‘*Devadatta*’;—‘*hairs*’—*i.e*., of the cow, the horse and the goat, not
of man; as the latter, when fallen from the body, are untouchable; for
in the present context all the purification mentioned pertains to cases
where a thing has been defiled by the touch of another substance, and
not where the thing is unclean by its very nature; that this is so is
indicated by the fact that exactly the same purification has been laid
down for cloth and grain.

Vegetables have to be dealt with in the same manner as grains. That is
just as *sprinkling* and *washing* are the means of purifying grains,
while they are still in the form of grains, and have not undergone
embellishment by means of *thumping* and the like acts,—so also are they
for the purifying of vegetables also. Hence the present rule pertains to
*uncooked* vegetables only. As for *cooked* vegetables, even though they
are spoken of as ‘vegetables’, yet some other method of purification has
to be found for them; as it has been said—‘by clean water and by the
flame of fire’ and be forth. For vegetables taken out of large heaps, as
also for gruel, cow’s milk and the rest, *sprinkling* and *heating on
fire* hate been specially laid down by Hārīta;—and similarly, for all
grains in pods, scrubbing and pounding and so forth.

All this is for the purpose of removing all doubts in the event of their
being touched by foot, as it has been said that ‘all things in large
quantities are pure.’—(118).

‘*Uṣa*’ is *saline earth*.

The ‘*soap-berry*’ and other things mentioned are well-known.

When the stuffs spoken of are stained by an oily substance, they have to
be rubbed over with the powder of the things mentioned, and then washed.

‘*Silken-stuff*’, ‘*kauśeya*’, is a particular kind of doth; so also the
‘*aṃśu-paṭṭa*’; the ‘*āvika*’, is *woolen stuff*. In connection with
this latter *Hārīta* has declared that ‘woolen articles are purified by
the sun.’ But this should be understood as pertaining to such stuffs as
are constantly worn, and hence come into contact with the bodies of
several persons; and not when they have become defiled by foreign
contamination.

By reason of all these being ‘cloth’, it might be thought that
‘sprinkling and washing’ would be the means of purifying them; and the
present text prescribes the methods for moving the stains of oil, &c.

‘*Kṣauma*’, ‘*Linen*’, includes *jute stuff* also. (119).

‘*Palāla*’, ‘*straw*,’ is the name applied to corn-stalks used in the
making of mats and such other things

‘*Grass*’,—*i.e*., *kuśa*, ordinary grass, and so forth.

“In connection with the mention of ‘wooden articles’ (114), it has been
remarked that the mention of the *product* implies the *cause* also;
under the circumstances, why should ‘wood’ be mentioned in the present
verse?”

It is mentioned for the purpose of emphasising the fact that
*sprinkling* alone is what should be done. And it is in virtue of this
that until the cause contamination is very serious, people do not have
recourse to scraping the wood. In the event of its being touched fay the
Cāṇḍala and such unclean persons, the purification is brought about ‘by
means of the rays of the sun, of the moon and. wind’; but in the case of
things made of wood,—such as the ladle and the like,—if the
contamination is slight, people desirous of using them in connection
with food &c., should have recourse to sprinkling and scraping.

‘*Sweeping*’—is the dealing of the house, which consists in removing of
the stains of smoke and such things.

‘*Smearing*’—*i.e*., rubbing the floor with cow-dung, lime or some such
thing.

All this should be understood to be necessary in the ‘case of the whole
wall of the house becoming defiled by the touch of a dead body, *a
cāṇḍala*, a menstruating woman and such persons; while in the case of
only a portion of the wall being defiled, only that part should be
*smeared*. Bat in the case of defilement by a dead body falling on the
roof, walls should be scraped, rays of the sun should be made to enter
the house, and the inside should be exposed to flames of fire; and in
some cases *re-building* also has been laid down. All this comes under
the term ‘*clearing*’.

Of earthen articles, there should be ‘*re-baking*’. That is, when it has
been touched by a man with unwashed mouth, it shall be heated on fire;
actual *rebaking* is to be done only in the case of its bring defiled by
such undean things as a *wine-keg* and the like. When however it is
touched by the wine itself, it should be thrown away. This is what has
been thus declared by Vaśiṣṭha (3.59)—‘An earthen article is not
purified by rebaking, if it has been touched by wine, mine, ordure,
spittings, pus and blood’.—(121).

*Viṣṇu* (23.56).—‘A house is purified by scouring it with a broom, and
smearing the ground with cow-dung, and a book by sprinkling water over
it. Land is cleansed by smearing it with cow-dung.’

*Gautama* (1.29).—‘Metals should he scoured; things made of clay should
be thoroughly heated by fire; those of wood should be planed; and cloth
made of yarns should be washed.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.8.34).—‘Earthen vessels must be heated.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.13.21-25).—‘Grass placed on unconsecrated ground should
he washed; grass defiled out of one’s sight should he sprinkled; small
pieces of fuel should be purified in the same manner; large pieces of
wood should be washed and dried; but a large quantity of wood should be
sprinkled with water.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.14.1, 2).—‘Earthen vessels touched by impure persons
must he exposed to the fire of *kuśa* grass; those defiled by stains of
food-leavings should be exposed to another burning.’

*Āpastamba* (1.17.9, 10).—‘If he eats out of an earthen vessel, he shall
eat out of one that has not been used; if he gets a used vessel, he
shall use it after having heated it thoroughly.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.49, 58).—‘Objects of metal should be scoured with ashes;
those of clay should be thoroughly heated by fire; those of wood should

following:—“A woman is purified by her courses, a river by its current,
brass by ashes, and an earthen pot by another burning.”’

*Viṣṇu* (23, 16, 18, 33).—‘Grass, fire-wood, dry cow-dung and leaves arc
cleansed by sprinkling of water; these same when defiled without stains,
by washing, when there is a small quantity of them; earthen vessels are
cleansed by a second burning.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.187-188).—‘Earthenware is cleansed by a second burning;
the ground is purified by sweeping, burning and lapse of time, by cows
walking over it, by sprinkling and scraping. The house is cleansed by
sweeping and smearing.’

*Uśanas* (Aparārka, p. 263).—‘Earthenware smeared with food-leavings
should be washed; those touched by such leavings should be sprinkled.’

*Devala* (Do. 7, p. 265).—‘The ground is cleansed in five ways—by
digging, by burning, by smearing, by washing and by rain.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘The ground is purified in seven ways—by digging, by
filling, by burning, by rain, by smearing, by cows passing over it and
by lapse of time; ground is pure everywhere except whore it bears
perceptible traces of impurity.’

*Baudhāyana* (Do.).—‘When a house has been defiled by the touch of a
corpse, its walls should be scraped, sun’s rays should be made to enter
it and it should be touched by burning fire. Solid ground should be
smeared; that with holes should he ploughed over; wet ground should have
all impurities removed and then covered over.’

*Saṃvarta* (Do.).—‘When a house has been defiled by the presence of a
dead body in it, all earthen vessels and cooked food should be thrown
away; then it should be smeared with cow-dung, and goats should be made
to smell it, then the whole of it should be sprinkled by Brahmaṇas with
*kuśa* and water.’

*Marīci* (Aparārka, p. 266).—‘If an outcast enter a house, it is
purified by smearing; if he dwells in it, then it should be burnt or
demolished.’

*Sprinkling*—with cow’s urine or water; or by milk, as laid down in some

‘*Scraping*.’—Scratching with some weapon and then throwing away the
scraped earth, according to Gautama’s direction that ‘of land there
should be throwing away’ (1.32).

‘*By these five*.’—This re-iteration is with a view to indicate that the
methods may be used singly or collectively. ‘*Smearing* without
‘*cleaning*’, is a means of purifying a spot which is not supplied with
a dust-inn. If the ground is stained with urine or ordure, there should
be *scraping* and *sweeping*. In the case of river-banks and forests,
there should be sprinkling with water.

‘*Lodging of cows*’—making the land a cow-pen for a single day.

All this should be done in the case of land lying near the
cremation-ground. In the case of land containing bones and skull, a
portion of the earth should be taken out and thrown away to another
place; also where all these may not be visible, but where their
existence and subsequent appearance may be suspected.—(122).

The use of the term ‘eaten’ indicates that the text pertains to *food*.

‘*By birds*’—*i.e*., parrots and other birds that are eatable—what has
been eaten out of (rendered a ‘leaving’). This does not apply to what
may have been eaten by the crow, the vulture and other such birds; as in
connection with this extensive expiatory rites have been prescribed
under the text ‘what has been licked by a bird &c., &c.,’ which lays
down the expiration to be performed in the case of food which, by
itself, is quite pure. Thus it is that there is no purification for food
that has been eaten out of by the cow, in connection with the eating of
which a similar elaborate expiation has been laid down. Though such may
be the law, yet it is necessary to find out other Smṛti-texts and usage
bearing upon the subject. As a matter of fact, when food, larger in
quantity than ten cupfulls, has been defiled by the crow and other such
birds, what cultured people do is to throw away just that portion of it
that has been touched, and make use of the remainder after having
purified it; but if it is less than ten cupfulls, they throw it away.
Here also the peculiar circumstances of each case have to be taken into
consideration.

In another Smṛti-text, food defiled by the black birds has also been
prohibited.

‘*Blown upon*’—with breath from the mouth, or over which a piece of
cloth has been shaken for the purpose of being dusted.

^(‘)*Sneezed at*’—that food on which some one has sneezed.

^(‘)*Hair*’—of men from their heads.—^(‘)*Insects*’—small organisms;
some of these, born out of moisture in the house, if they fall upon the
food while living, they do not defile the food; just as is the case with
flies. The present purification is laid down for the case where *dead*
insects tall on the food. Those insects, on the other hand, that are
born out of impure sources, or which live upon dirt, they defile the
food, even when living. Says Gautama (17.89)—^(‘)What is defiled by hair
and insects is ever uneatable.⁹ When the food happens to be covered by a
large number of these, the whole of it should be thrown away.

In the case of large heaps of food, if a small portion of it happen to
be contaminated by impure insects, that much alone of the food has to be
thrown away and the remainder is purified.

In the case of contamination by hair, another Smṛti has laid down that
the food shall be touched by vessels of gold, silver, *kuśa* and gems,
along with water. In certain works *heating* also has been prescribed.

Some people have taken this verse as laying down a rule for the
purification of *land*. But they go against—(*a*) other Smṛti-texts,
(*b*) usage and (*c*) the direct meaning of the text.—(123).

‘*Avodhūtam*’—‘blown upon with the mouth, or blown upon with a piece of
cloth’ (Medhātithi);—‘dusted with cloth’ (Govindarāja);—‘moved by the
wind from a cloth, the foot or the like’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘defiled by the
dust of a broom or of the air moved by the wings of a bird’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 105), which
explains ‘*avadhūtam*’ as ‘touched by the dust raised by the shaking of
a cloth’,—‘*avakṣutam*’ as ‘touched by drops of saliva dropped in
sneezing’;—it adds that if the food has contained hair or insects during
cooking, then it must be thrown away.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 458), which adds that the ‘bird’
here meant is one that is among the *eatable* ones; it explains

upon’;—in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 2), which explains ‘*avodhūtam*’ as ‘over
which cloth has been dusted’;—and in *Smrtisāroddhāra* (p. 244) which
gives the same explanation of ‘*avodhūtam*’ and says that
‘*mṛtkṣepaṇam*’ includes *water-sprinkling* also.

*Viṣṇu* (23.38).—‘Food nibbled at by a bird, smelt at by a cow, sneezed
on. or defiled by hair, or bv insects or worms, is purified by earth
scattered over it.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.22-23).—‘Food defiled by contact with a garment, hair or
insects shall not be eaten;—but it may be eaten after taking out the
hair and the insects, sprinkling it with water, dropping ashes on it,
and after it has been declared by the Brahmaṇa to be fit for eating.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.189).—‘Food smelt by the cow, or defiled by hair, flies
or insects, should have water and ashes or earth sprinkled over it, for
purifying it.’

*Baudhāyana* (Aparārka, p. 266).—Blue fly, ordure, insects, bugs are
defilers of food. On seeing hair, insect, nail, etc., in food, that part
of the food where they are found should be thrown away, and the
remainder should have ashes and water sprinkled over it; and it may be
taken, after it has been recommended.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 266).—‘If a fly or hair is found in the food, or if it
is sneezed at or blown upon, one should touch it with ash and then eat
it.’

*Āpastamba* (Do.).—‘That food wherein is found an insect that has
touched impure substances.’

*Śātātapa* (Do., p. 267)—‘Food containing hair or insects, or smelt
upon, or defiled by flies, or seen by a newly delivered woman, or by a
woman in her courses, or by a heretic,—is purified in the following
manner: sprinkling water over it, taking out a little of the food, the
rest one may eat. Or he may touch it with ashes or with water, or by
gold and silver.’

*Baudhāyana* (again, Aparārka, p. 267).—‘If cooked sacrificial food is
defiled by crows and other things, the portion defiled should be taken
out. Honey and water become purified by being poured into another
vessel; similarly oil and clarified butter.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘On food being smelt or seen by undesirable persons, or
on its being defiled by the presence of hair or insects, it should be
touched by water, with gold, silver, ashes, copper, emerald, cow’s hair,
deer-skin or *kaśa*,—sprinkled with *mantras*, taken round fire, exposed
to the sun; thus does it become purified.’

*Parāśara* (Do.).—‘Food cooked when exceeding a *Droṇa* in quantity
should not he thrown away, even when defiled by dogs or crows; it should
he offered to Brāhmaṇas and then used according to their advice.’

*Jamadagni* (Do.).—‘Cooked food, one *Droṇa* in weight,—if defiled by
dogs or crows, should have a handful thrown out, and the rest becomes
purified by heating on fire and sprinkling with water;—same with cooked
food enough for lasting one day, when defiled by dogs and crows, or by
the presence of hair and insects.’

*Baudhāyana* (Do., p. 268).—‘Finding skin, hair or nails in the food,
one shall throw about a handful of it, and sprinkling water and
scattering ashes over it, again sprinkling water, one may eat it after
having obtained the recommendation of Brāhmaṇas.’

‘*Unclean*’—Untouchable.

“If that be so, then what is not eatable by the person concerned, that
alone will be a source of contamination for him; e g., wine and spirit
would be^(‘)unclean’ for the *Brāhmaṇa*, but not for the *Śūdra*.”

This is not right; because substances intended as offering-materials at
a sacrifice are ‘not eatable’, before the offerings have been made; and
yet they are not^(‘)untouchable As for wines and spirits, even the
*touching* of these has been prohibited, for the *Brāhmaṇa*. So that
that thing may be regarded as a source of contamination for a man the
*touching* of which has been prohibited for him. So that what is true
is, not^(‘)what is *not eatable* is *untouchable*,’ but that ‘what is
*untouchable* is *not eatable*.’

‘*Tainted*’—besmeared; contaminated.

‘*So long*’,—this prescribes repetition of the act.

‘*Earth and water*’;—all this to be is used only if there is need for
it; and the *need* would consist in the removing of the smell and stain.
So that in the case of the touch of such unclean things as are dry, or
in the case of the contamination having

taken place long ago,—since the smell and stain would have been removed
by the lapse of time,—washing with earth and water should have to be
done once only.

“The use of earth and water is for a visible purpose,—since it is only
by their use that the stain is removed and the thing is purified; what
then is the use of the phrace ‘*as long as &c*.’?”

The explanation is as follows:—The qualifying phrase has been added with
a view to exceeding the restricted number of applications, specifically
laid down in such texts as —‘ once to the urinary organ, thrice to the
anus &c, &c.’ (3.448); the sense being that if the removal of the stain
&c., of the excretions be found to be impossible by the restricted
number of applications, the said restrictions are to be ignored and more
applications used. All that the mention of the exact, number of
applications means is that even if the smell and stain be removed by a
less number of applications, the prescribed number must be made up.

‘*Earth and water*’ have been mentioned only as indicating things that
may be used as a means of purification. Hence even though the
contaminating substance may have been washed off by water, yet it should
be rubbed with saline substances, so that not a trace of the substance
may he visible.

‘*Disappear*’—go off, cease.

‘*Caused by it*’—caused by the *unclean* substance. Hence there would be
no contamination if the smell of such substances as musk and the like
did not disappear from clothing &c. But in the case of a thing painted
with *kuṅkuma* and such substances, if any portion of it should happen
to be contaminated by an unclean thing, then the *kuṅkuma* also has to
be removed from that portion; and this for the simple reason that the
*kuṅkuma* also is in contact with the unclean thing; specially there
also the^(‘)smell and taint’ are present. If however the colour of
*kuṅkuma* happens to be attached to one’s body, and it cannot be removed
by rubbing, then purification may be attained (even by the use of earth
and water).—(124).

‘*Pavitram*’—pure.

The mention of the gods is by way of commendation.

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ includes, according to usage, all castes.

‘*What is not seen*’;—a thing that, though lying in an unprotected
place, is yet not actually seen to have been contaminated by the touch
of the dog, the crow or such other things. The mere presence of such
animals should not be made the ground for suspecting actual defilement,
until it is actually perceived. Similarly there can be no harm in a man
partaking of food prepared in the kitchen by cooks and others who may
have done the cooking without having themselves undergone a cleansing
process \[if anything unclean is not actually perceived\].

In this connection, no one should entertain the idea that—‘there would
be nothing wrong in the partaking of food if the defilement were
entirely unknown.’ As this would be contrary to what has been declared
(in 5.20) regarding the sinfulness of eating certain things
*unintentionally*.

Thus the conclusion is that a thing is to be regarded as *pure* in
connection with which no contamination is known by any of the recognised
means of knowledge. But when, even in the absence of definite proof,
there be even the slightest and most far-fetched suspicion regarding
contamination, the thing concerned should be washed with water. *E.g*.
when from among a large number of dishes and cups lying in the same
place, if even *one* has been seen to be contaminated by the touch of
the dog or some such thing, all the rest of them also should be washed
with water.

To this same category (of ‘*what is not seen*’) belongs also ‘*what is
commended by word*.’ That is cultured men should be made to pronounce
the thing to be *pure*. They say that things become pure by the
Brāhmaṇa’s word. The *present tense* in ‘*praśasyate*’, ‘*is
commended*’, has the force of the *Injunctive*.

Some people explain the^(‘)commendation’ here spoken of as follows “When
the person going to make use of a certain thing has seen it being
defiled, even if he does not himself see it being purified, he should
believe it to have been purified if cultured people assure him that it
has undergone purification.”

This however is not right. Since the assertion of a trustworthy person
has nowhere been spoken of as being unreliable, to assert it here would
be a needless repetition.

Others have explained the term ‘*what is washed with water*’ as meant to
be an example,—and the ‘*unseen*’ and the ‘*commended by word*’ as the
two whose purity is here enjoined; the sense being—‘Just as what is
washed with water is pure, so also should be regarded *what is not seen*
and *what is commended by word*’

“If everything is *pure*, in which no contamination is cognised by
either Perception or Inference or Verbal Authority,—then why should the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* have been prescribed (under 5.21) as to be performed for
the expiation of the sin of having partaken of defiled food, without
knowledge *?*”

What has been said under 5.21 is in connection with what is *At for
being eaten*; while the present text deals with *purification* in
general. Or, a distinction may be drawn between the two declarations,
either on the ground of one referring to cases of more serious
defilement than the other, or on the ground of one referring to times of
distress and the other to normal times.—(125)

This is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 469) as laying down the means of
satisfaction where defilement is only suspected;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
454), which adds the following note:—‘*adṛṣṭam*’ is ‘that which has
never been known to be suspected of defilement’,—‘*vācā
praśasyate*’—when a thing has been suspected of being defiled, if the
Brāhmaṇas declare ‘may this be pure’, it has to be regarded as
pure;—such being the explanation, it adds, provided by *Dīpakalikā* and
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 818);—in *Nityācāropradīpa*
(p. 102) which explains ‘*adṛṣṭam*’, as ‘not perceived to be defiled’,
*i.e*., where no defilement is known to exist by any means of
knowledge,—‘*nirṇiktam*’, washed, when suspected of being
defiled,—‘*Vācā etc*.’ if even after washing, there is some compunction,
this is removed when the thing is commended;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p
292);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 459) which says that ‘*brāhmaṇa*’
stands for all the four castes.

The ‘ground’ is mentioned only by way of illustration; so that water in
canals is also pure. Water on the ground, as also in the atmosphere, is,
by its very nature, pure; but the ground, being in contact with unclean
substances, is slightly impure; hence when water is collected on the
ground, it imbibes impurity by contact; and the present text proceeds to
point out what quantity of water thus collected is to be regarded as
*pure*:—‘*Sufficient to* *allay the thirst of the cow*’;—‘*vaitṛṣṇyam*’
means *freedom* *from* *thirst*, This is meant to indicate a particular
quantity; this explanation having been adopted by the ancients on the
strength of the words of the Veda—‘so that the dawlap of the cow dapples
in water &c. &c.’ Thus the quantity meant is that in which the cow’s
dewlap becomes submerged, or which allays her thirst.

Water collected on pure ground is pure, even in small quantities.

“How is it to be known that water has been ‘*contaminated by an unclean
thing*’?”

In answer to this we have the phrase—‘*becoming affected by its*
*smell*, *colour and taste*,’ The Instrumental ending in ‘*amedhyena*’,
‘*by* *an unclean thing*’, has to be changed here into the *genitive*;
the meaning being—‘when the water imbibes the smell, colour and taste
*of* *the unclean thing*, then it is to be regarded as *contaminated* by
it.’ According to this construction, if in a tank, an unclean thing be
found in one part, while in another part the water be found to be free
from its smell &c., then this latter is to be regarded as pure—(126).

shun that water which has an evil smell, bad colour and bad taste; the
natural colour and taste of water are white and sweet, and though there
is no natural smell, yet of transferred smell only the agreeable one is
to be accepted, hence the meaning is that water should be used only when
it is either odourless or has an agreeable odour;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*

*Baudhāyana* (1.9.10).—‘Water collected on the ground with which cows
slake their thirst is a means of purification, provided it is not
strongly mixed with unclean substances, nor has smell, nor is
discoloured, nor has taste.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.35, 36, 47).—‘Water (for sipping) may be taken even out of
a hole in the ground, if it is sufficient to slake the thirst of cows.
He shall not purify himself with water that has been defiled with
colours, perfumes or flavouring substances; nor with such as is
collected in unclean places. Water collected on the ground that quenches
the thirst of the cows, the Lord of created things has declared to be
pure.’

*Viṣṇu* (23.43).—‘Stagnant water, if even a single cow can quench her
thirst with it, is pure, unless it is quite filled with unclean objects;
it is the same with water upon a rock.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.192).—‘Water in its natural condition, standing on the
ground, is pure, if it is sufficient to satisfy a cow.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 272).—‘That water is declared to he purificatory
which is devoid of smell and flavour, free from dirt, and such as would
not disappear if a cow were to drink out of it.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 273).—‘Water, at a drinking booth in the forest, or
in a jar, or in a well, or in a water-pot, or in a stone-cup, or in a
leather-bag, is unfit for drinking, except in times of distress.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 119).—‘Rain-water collected on the ground is
purified in ten nights.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Kāru*’ is artisan; such as the cook; the dyer, the weaver and so forth
the hand of these people is ‘*always* *pure*.’ It is for this reason
that they are touchable even during periods of impurity caused by birth
or death. But it does not mean that their hand is to be regarded as pure
even when found to be actually bearing the stains of ordure or such
unclean things.

What is stated here is on the same footing with what as been asserted
before regarding certain people being ‘immediately purified.’ Nor is
there any superfluous repetition; as no such purification has been
declared anywhere else in the Institutes of Manu. Then the present text
contemplates another case also, *e.g*. weavers, as a rule, weave cloth
without bathing for separating the yarns from the pillars they make use
of dough and gruel &c.—they place the vessels containing these things
at random:—the ‘impurity’ involved in all this is what is negatived by
the present text; and it is not meant that people who are impure by
their very nature are to be regarded as ‘touchable’ by taking to the
work of artisans; because such work has not been ordained for them.

This same reasoning holds good regarding the view that things touched by
*Mlecchas* are not impure. In connection with these, *sprinkling* and
*washing* have to be done, as laid down by Śaṅkha, who reads—‘The
artisan’s hand is pure, and so also are substances in a heap.’

‘*Merchandise*’;—the substance that is sold for money, or is exchanged
for some other substance, is called ‘*merchandise*’; and when this is
‘*spread out*’ in the market-place, it is pure. That is, it does not
become defiled by such contaminations as being handled by several
purchasers, being spread out on unwashed ground and so forth, even
though one may perceive such contaminations again and again. Since the
text speaks of its being ‘*spread out*’, it follows that so long as the
thing is stored within a room, it is not pure, even though it is ‘in the
market-place’.—As regards cooked substances, such as fried flour, cakes
and the like,—though these also are ‘pure’ (when spread out in the
market-place), yet they are not fit for eating; as declared by
Śaṅkha—‘things exposed in the marketplace are not fit for eating’.

‘*Held by the student*’.—By reason of the ‘purity’ being spoken of in
this verse along with this term, it is to be regarded as pertaining to
such contamination as the following—(*a*) treading along the public road
in course of begging (*b*) the sight of unclean objects, (*c*) spitting
and sneezing, (*d*) the dropping of one hand on the food obtained and so
forth,—all which are probable.

‘*Sacred*’;—this is meant to imply *purity*—(127).

The mouth of all women is ‘*pure*’— for the purposes of kissing &c.
‘Women during sexual intercourse etc.’—says another *Smṛti* -text. What
is said here applies only to such women with whom sexual intercourse is
possible, and not to the mother, sister and such women. This should not
be understood to be the denial of the impurity attaching to the mouth
until it is washed after food. Because even though the wife is a woman
with whom sexual intercourse is possible, yet it has been declared in
discourse IV that ‘one should not eat with his wife’.

The addition of the term ‘*always*’ implies that the mouth is pure, not
only at the time of the actual intercourse, but also during the acts
that lead up to it.

‘*The bird in the dropping of fruits*’.— Though the term “*śakuni*’,
‘*bird*’, denotes all kinds of birds, yet by usage, what is said here is
not applicable to the crow, the vulture or other such birds as feed upon
unclean things.

Since the text uses the term ‘*dropping*’, the present rule applies only
to fruits on the tree.

‘*In causing the flow*’.—*When* the cow is being milked, the calf is
made to touch the teats for the purpose of making the milk to flow; and
yet it has been declared that ‘cows are pure except in their mouths’; so
that the touch of the calf’s mouth might be regarded as a source of
impurity; it is with a view to preclude this notion that we have the
present text.

The dog itself is not pure; but it is to be regarded as pure when in the
course of hunting, it catches’the deer—(128).

The term ‘*kha*’ stands for *organ*; hence the *organs of action* also
become included; and thus taking the two feet, the plural number becomes
justified in the phrase ‘*those that are below it are impure*.’

This explanation (by which the lower organs are all made *impure*) is
not right; as it is contrary to what has gone in the first half. Therein
it has been declared that the purity of those above the navel is of a
higher grade and superior: and this could have a meaning only if the
lower ones also were *pure*; for what is *while* cannot be called *more
black*.

Further, the term ‘*kha*’ does not signify the *organ*, it only
signifies the *cavity* or *hole*. It is for this reason that the organs
have been spoken of as ‘*saptaśirṣanyaḥ*’, ‘having seven seats’ (the
cavities of the two ears, two eyes, two nostrils and the mouth). There
are two ‘cavities’ below the navel; but the plural number has been used
on account of the male and female generative organs being regarded as
distinct.

According to this, there would be no uncleanliness of the hand involved
in touching the inside of the mouth;—but only if if does not come into
contact with the phlegm or other things that may be there. So. that if
the hand does become contaminated with some such defiling substance, the
mouth shall not be touched by it—(130).

The impurity of the bodily excretions having been asserted in 131, the
present verse proceeds to lay down directions for their cleansing.

‘*Ejectors of urine and faeces*’—*i.e*., the. organs by which these are
passed,—*i*. *e*. the Anus &c.—for the cleansing of these—one should
‘*use earth and water*, *as much as may be necessary*’; *i*. *e*. not
minding any restrictions as to the number (of washings and rubbings),
one should go on taking up as much water and earth as may be necessary
for the total removal of smells and stains.

‘*Bodily*’—proceeding from the body,—‘*excretions*’—which are sources of
impurity. In connection with the purifications necessitated by these
also, earth and water are to be used as much as may be necessary. In
another *Smṛti* we read—‘In the case of the former six excretions both
earth and water should be used; in the case of the latter six one is
purified even by the use of water only’.

In connection with phlegm &c. it is thus declared in another
*Smṛti*—‘The viscid excretion from the nose is called *Phlegm*’; and
since this occurs among the latter group of six, for cleansing it earth
need not be used at all.—(132).

(enumerated in the next verse) the use of clay is optional;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 51), which adds that after the passing of urine and
feces, washing with water is ‘*arthavat*,’ ‘useful’;—in *Vīramitrodaya*

either of the two only;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 794).

After the passing of urine and faeces, for the cleansing of the urinary
organ, earth should be applied to it once.

In another *Smṛti* it has been laid down that one should take as much
earth mixed with water as can be contained in one hand. What I assert is
that in view of what has been said regarding the using of as much earth
and water as may be necessary, the proper quantity would be what is
stated in the present text. Some people quote, in this connection, the
following saying—‘The hand bring filled up, the first (and largest)
measure of it is called *Prasṛti*, the second is half of it; and the
third part of it is called *mṛttikā*.’ But this measure applies to the
case of anus-cleansing only. In all other cases, as much is to be used
as may be necessary.

In the case of a single evacuation also, the number of applications is
to be as here prescribed; and what is prescribed is the repetition of
the act (of rubbing and washing).

There is a distinction among the various kinds of ‘earth’, just as there
is among the various kinds of the ‘cow’ and other things. In present
connection, for instance, it has been declared that ‘earth should be got
from a place far removed from an ant-hill, us also from the stables’ and
so forth. No account need be taken however of the distinction into
‘white’, ‘black’, ‘red’ and so forth.

Having ‘*passed*’—*i.e*., cleansed away according to the aforesaid
directions,—all taint of urine &c., from the urinary organ, etc.;—‘*and
sipped water*,’—‘*one should touch with water the cavities*’.

‘*Also when he may be going to read the Veda*’—*i.e*., according to the
course of Vedic study preserved in Discourse II.

In accordance with its primary signification, the word ‘*kṛtvā*’,
‘*having passed* appears to mean ‘having evacuated’; and the meaning is
that—‘after having passed urine and faeces and washed the anus and the
urinary organ, one should sip water’.

‘*Also when going to read the Veda*;’—the sipping of water has been
prescribed as a necessary duty in connection with the course of Vedic
study, under 2.70. What is prescribed here is meant for all sorts of
reading of the Veda—either by one who is *teaching* it, or *reading* it.
In other cases, people are said to be ‘reciting’ the Veda
(*udaharantaḥ*). The meaning is that after having done other secular
acts, one should not pronounce the words of the Veda, without having
sipped water.

‘*Also when going to take food*.’ (136).

This is the reiteration (of a former injunction), for the purpose of
enjoining what is necessary for the woman and the *Śūdra*. Though what
is said here has been already declared before, yet it is repeated here
for the sake of women and *Śūdras*.

Some people explain this text as follows:—According to the rule that
‘the Śūdra is purified by touching water’, all that the ordinary Śūdra
is to do is to touch water; hence washing and touching of the ear, etc.,
that are understood as applying to the

*Śūdra*, are regarded as pertaining to the better class of *Śūdras*. As
regards women,—the general rule being that ‘the Brāhmaṇa is purified by
water reaching the heart &c., &c.’ (2. 62), where the different castes
are specified, it would seem as if all that is prescribed for males is
to be done by females also; and it is with a view to preclude this
notion that we have the present text.

‘*Desiring bodily purification*’;—this indicates that if one is quite
clean when going to read or to take food, he need not necessarily repeat
the acts *thrice*; nor need there be *washing*;—*all* that need be done
is the sipping of some quantity of water, and the touching of the
organs; and not all the details that have been laid down in connection
with the ‘sipping of water’ prescribed among the duties of the
Student.—(137).

A general rule of conduct is here laid down for the better class of
*Śūdras*.

‘*Living according to law*;’—*i.e*. attending on twice-born men and
performing the great sacrifices. By these ‘*shaving*’—of the head—shall
be done ‘*every month*’. The Genitive in *Śūdrāṇām* has the sense of the
Instrumental. Or, in as much as *śūdras* are entirely dependent upon
Brāhmaṇas their shaving shall be got done by these latter; and in this
case the root ‘*kṛ*,’ which has several meanings, is to be taken in the
sense of *advising*.

The details of the manner of purification—in connection with births,
deaths and the rest—should be like those of the *Vaisḥya*.

‘*Māsikam mpanam kāryam*’ means, according to Nandana, ‘shall offer the
monthly *Śrāddha*.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 906), which adds the following
notes:—The rule of purity pertaining to the Vaiśya means a period of
impurity extending over *fifteen* days;—‘*Nyāyavartinām*’ means devoted
to the service of the twice-born, the offering of the Five Great
Sacrifices, the supporting of dependents, the loving of wife and so
forth.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 111);—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p.
318), which leads ‘*ārya*’ (for ‘Vaiśya’) and explains it as
*Vaiśya*;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 10), which has the following notes:—That
‘Śūdra’ is called *Nyāyavartin* who, with a purely religious motive,
serves the Brāhmaṇa honestly and earnestly, performs the Five Sacrifices
with ‘*namaḥ*’ as the mantra, avoids all forbidden food and forbidden
acts,—such a *Śūdra* becomes purified in *Fifteen* days, in the manner
of a Vaiśya,—he should *shave* every month,—or *vapanam* may mean
‘offering of Piṇḍas’ *i.e*., the Śrāddha on the Moonless Day,—it is only
such a Śūdra that is entitled to eat the food-leavings of the
Brāhmaṇa,—this curtailment of the period of impurity (from one month to
fifteen days) is only for the purpose of the man serving the Brāhmaṇa,
and for that of offering the Five Sacrifices and so forth,—in
*Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 573), which explains *vapanam* as shaving and
says that the Śūdra should not keep long hair,—or it may stand for the
*Amāvasyā Śrāddha*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 352).

In the text—‘on having spat and on having told a lie &c.’ (5.144)—it has
been laid down that on spitting one should sip water; which indicates
that until one has sipped water, he remains impure. Drops issuing from
the mouth would also be a form of ‘spitting;; so that the issuing of
drops of water from the mouth standing on the same footing as the
spitting of phlegm, it might be thought that it should necessitate the
sipping of water. With a view to this contingency, the author has added
the present verse.

‘*Mukhyaḥ*’— produced in, or issuing from, the mouth such ‘*drops*’ do
not make one impure, if they do not fall upon the body.

“But it has been already declared that drops are pure (5-132.)”

But that was with reference to things other than bodily excretions. That
this was meant there is clearly indicated by the present verse; which
makes it clear that *all kinds of drops* were not meant when they were
declared to be pure.

‘*Śmaśruṇi*’—hairs of the beard,—‘*that enter the mouth*’—‘do not make
one impure’; this has to be construed with the present phrase; so that
they do become the cause of some slight evil effects (even though they
do not make the man impure).

So also ‘*what adheres to the teeth*.’ In connection with this we have
greater details in another *Smṛti text*—‘What adheres to the teeth is
like the teeth, except what is touched by the tongue;—some say that this
is so before it falls off from the teeth;—what falls off is to be
treated as saliva the man becomes pure by swallowing it.’ (*Gautama*
1.38 to 40.) ‘Those that fall off’—*i.e*. without bang touched by the
tongue: since the touch of the tongue has been declared to be not
pure.—(139).

This verse is quoted in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 353), which explains
‘*mukhyāḥ*’ as ‘those proceeding from the mouth’ and
‘*Dantāntaraviṣṭitam*’ (which is its reading for *Dhiṣṭhitam*) as ‘what
has entered between the teeth’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 972),

*Viṣṇu* (23.53).—‘Such drops as fall from the mouth of a man upon any
part of his body do not render it impure; nor do hairs of the beard that
enter his month; nor remnants of food adhering to his teeth.’

*Gautama* (1.38-41).—‘Remnants of food adhering to the teeth are as his
teeth (and do not make him impure), except if he touches them with the
tongue; or before they fall from their place, according to some people;
if they do become detached, he should know that he is purified by merely
swallowing them, like saliva; drops of saliva dropping from the mouth do
not cause impurity, except when they fall on a limb of the body.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.8.24, 25).—‘What adheres to the teeth should be regarded
like the teeth; because it is fixed like the teeth. Let him not sip
water on their account in case it falls; if it flows out, he shall be
pure. They quote the following:—“If anything adheres to the teeth, it is
pure like the teeth; and if he swallows it, or whatever else may be in
the mouth, or may remain there after he has sipped water, he will become
pure.”’

*Āpastamba* (1.16.11-13).—‘He does not become impure by the hair of his
moustache getting into his mouth, as long as he does not touch them with
his hand; if drops of saliva are perceived to fall from his mouth, then
he shall sip water; some people declare that if the saliva falls on the
ground, he need not sip water.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.37).—‘Drops of saliva falling from the mouth, which do not
touch a limb of the body, do not make a man impure.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.195).—‘Drops issuing from the mouth are pure; so also
the water dropped in sipping water; and the hair of the moustache
entering one’s mouth; if anything adheres to the teeth, the man becomes
pure by throwing it out.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 277).—‘What adheres to the teeth is like the
teeth, when it is devoid of any taste,—except when it is touched by the
tongue.’

*Devala* (Do.).—‘What adheres to the teeth and cannot be taken out
should be regarded as the teeth; and he should not make much effort to
take it out, as if the sticks used wounded him, he would become very
impure.’

‘*Helping others to wash*,’—*i.e*. offering water to other persons.

The meaning is as follows When one is pouring water for another person
and the latter begins to sip water, if drops of water flowing out from
between the fingers of that person happen to fall on the ground and
rising from it, touch the feet of the man who is offering the
water,—that man is not made impure by them.

‘*Those on the ground*’.—The drops of water fulling from the hand of the
washing person, though unclean, should be regarded to be as clean as
small quantities of water collected on clean ground.

‘*By them*,’— touched, the man does not become impure.—(140)

notes:—

The construction is *parān ācāmayataḥ*; —*bhūmigaiḥ* means ‘the drops of

that if the drops of water fallen from the washings of one man happen to
touch others than the one who is helping in the washing,—then those
latter do become impure;—*pādau* includes other parts of the body
also,—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 251),—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 972),
which says that the construction is *parānācamayataḥ pādau*, and the

his mouth, then if the water dropped by the latter falls upon the feet
of the former, it does not make him unclean, because that water is
*bhaumikaiḥ samāḥ*, clean as any ordinary water on the ground,—it
follows that this refers only to the man who is pouring water for the

The man who has committed something necessitating ‘washing’ is called
‘unclean’. For instance, one who has passed urine or evacuated his
bowels, and has not performed the purificatory ablutions; or when he has
been defiled by the contamination of some unclean thing.

‘*With some substance in hand*;’—the person who is holding in his hand
some thing to be eaten or some metal or cloth, &c., is called
‘*dravyahastaḥ*’, the use of the compound being similar to such
compounds as ‘*khadgahastaḥ*’.

If such a person happens to be touched, then ‘*without laying
down*’—without setting aside—‘*that substance*’—he should wash.

“How can the man wash, when he has a substance in his hand? The
procedure of washing has been described as ‘washing the hand upto the
wrists and so forth.”

In answer to this some people offer the following explanation:—What is
meant by the man being ‘with some substance in hand’ is that he should
have the substance somewhere on his body, not necessarily in his hands.
Similarly in the case of impurity also if the man become defiled, the
contamination affects substances that may be lying on his shoulders
also. Similarly purification is obtained by washing. Hence the man
should perform the washing by removing the substance from his hand and
keeping it on his fore-arm, in his lap or in some other part part of his
body. The meaning is that just as the impurity of the man makes the
substance impure so also; the purification of the man renders the
substance pure.

Gautama has declared that—‘The man with a substance in hand, happening
to become unclean, should wash after *having kept away the substance*’
(1.28). This they explain as follows: Though both (*washing* and
*keeping away*) are spoken of together, yet it is the *keeping away*
that is meant to be enjoined by this text, otherwise all that would be
necessary in the circumstances would be the purifying of both himself
and the substance; and where would there be any necessity for the
*keeping away* of the substance? Hence, since, in the absence of the
text quoted, there would be no possibility of the *keeping away*, this
text must be taken as meant only for enjoining this latter. “How then
would the substance be purified?” It would be purified by being held by
the pure person,—or by the ‘washing’ prescribed by another *Smṛti-text*:
viz: ‘while dealing with foods and drinks if one happens to touch an
unclean thing, he should wash the article and then sip water: in this
manner it does not become defiled.’

“In the present verse nothing is said regarding the necessity of having
to keep away the substance, and yet if it were to be taken as implied,
the phrase ‘*without laying down*’ would be absolutely futile.”

As a matter of fact, the same purpose runs through all *Smṛtis*; and yet
from the direct words of the texts in the present instance we understand
that there is a clear difference of opinion (between Manu and Gautama).
So that the two should be regarded as optional alternatives; and the
rule determining the option would be that—(*a*) if the substance is a
heavy one it shall be laid aside, otherwise it may be kept on the
body,—or (*b*) when the man himself eats the food (carried), or he
touches a large quantity of unclean things, or is touched by a person
who should have washed but has not yet washed,—in all these cases the
touching of the substance would be a source of uncleanliness (141)

*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 476), which says that this refers to articles of
food;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 954), which says that according to
Medhātithi heavy objects are kept aside, but not small objects, but
according to *Smṛticandrikā* it refers to such clothing and other things

kept aside, food and metallic things may be kept aside, and clothes and
other things may or may not be kept aside;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p.
281), which quotes Viśvarupa to the effect that this refers to things
other than food and vegetables;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 317), which
says that the man should keep the thing on his body and rinse his mouth,
by which he himself, as also the thing carried, becomes
purified;—according to *Ratnākara*, this refers to milk only.

‘Vomitting’ and ‘purging’ are well known. The man who throws out the
food that he has eaten is said to have ‘*vomitted*’. The man the number
of whose motions has gone beyond the number *eight*,— either through
disease, or through his having taken *Harītakī* or some such
purgative—is said to have ‘*purged*.’

These two persons should first of all bathe.

Then, they should eat clarified butter and then any other kind of food;
and the injunction of eating clarified batter is meant to be a
prohibition of other kinds of food. Just as in the case of expiatory
rites, ashes and water are regarded as means of purification, so in the
case in question, is the eating of clarified butter.

‘*After having taken food he should only sip water*’— After he has taken
his food, if he happen to vomit or purge on the same day, then he should
do the sipping of water only, and not. bathing and eating of clarified
butter.

Others have taken this independently by itself, to mean that ‘after
having taken his food he should sip water this being a reiteration of
the water-sipping that has already been prescribed as to be done after
meals.

‘*One who has copulated*,’—*i.e*., one who has had sexual intercourse
with a woman,—becomes pure by bathing. (142).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 922); and again on (p. 926),
where it explains the meaning to be that ‘if one vomits after having
eaten food, he must wash’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.30), which adds, like
*Aparārka*, that the last clause refers to sexual intercourse during the
wife’s ‘courses’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 106), which notes that
‘*viriktaḥ*’ means ‘one who has abnormal purgings,’—and that the meaning
is that ‘if one vomits after he has taken his food, he should only
*wash*, and *not bathe*’;—and again on p. 199 where the construction of
the second half is explained as ‘*bhuktvā annam vāntaḥ*,’ whence the
meaning is that on vomitting immediately after food, there should be
*washing only*,—the particle ‘*eva*’ serving to preclude the *bathing*
which is prescribed in the first half of the verse for one who has
‘vomitted’;—the ‘sexual intercourse,’ refers to that during the
courses;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 331), which explains ‘*viriktaḥ*’ as
‘one who has had many motions,’ and adds that if one vomits immediately
after taking his food, he is simply to rinse his mouth, and for the man
who has had sexual intercourse during the wife’s ‘period,’ he is
cleansed by bathing;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 334), which says that
‘*vāntaḥ*’ is understood after ‘*bhuktvā annam*,’ and adds the same
notes;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 796).

‘*After having sneezed*,’—after having done *sneezing*, which is the
name given to the sound that emanates involuntarily from the nostrils of
a man moved by internal wind.

‘*Even though he may be quite pure*.’—This is to be construed only with
the phrase^(‘)*when going to read the Veda*’; the meaning being that
even though he be quite pure, he should, when going to read the Veda,
read it after having sipped water; *i.e*., the water sipping-should be
done as part of the procedure laid down in connection with Vedic study;
while after *sleep* &c., the water-sipping shall be done *once* only.

As for the following declaration—^(‘)Having slept, having sneezed,
having eaten, having drunk water, the wise man shall sip water and then
again sip water; as also after having spat and told lies’,—this has to
be construed to mean that ‘having sipped water, he should eat and then
sip water again.’ In a case however where it is clearly stated that ‘one
should sip water *twice*, the act has to be repeated consecutively.’

The first three quarters sum up the section dealing with Purifications;
and the fourth states briefly what is going to be explained.

The term ‘*rule regarding cleanliness*’, though a general one, yet, by
reason of the proximity of the term ‘purification of substances’, is to
be taken as standing for purification other than this latter; just as in
the case of the expression ‘*go-balīvarda*’ (the term ‘*go*’ stands for
the *cow* as distinguished from the *bull*, *balīvarda*).

‘*Duties of women*,’—such duties as have to be performed exclusively by
women; those that are common to men and women—such as the performance of
sacrifices and the like—are not described here.—(144).

The term ‘*sadā*’, like the term ‘*nitya*’, signifies *constantly*.

‘*Cheerful*’— always smiling. Even though elsewhere the might have had
reasons for anger and sorrow, yet when she sees her husband, she should
show that she is happy, by means of a cheerful face, smiles, sweet words
and so forth. This advice is meant for the married as well as the
unmarried girl.

‘*Alert in household-work*,’—*in* laying by and spending money in such
religious acts as bathing and the like. What is ‘household-work’ has
been explained in 9.11. In all that she should be ‘*alert*’, expert.
That is to say, she should be able to cook food quickly and so forth.

‘*She should have the utensils well cleaned*’— Vessels used in the
house, such as the jar, the the and so forth, are called ‘*utensils*’;
and all these should be ‘*well cleaned*’, thoroughly washed and
nice-looking.

‘*In spending*’—wealth, over the feeding of friends, relations and
guests,—‘*she should be close-fisted*’—not too liberal; that is, she
should not spend too much.

‘*Susaṃskṛtopaskaraya*’ is a *Bahuvrīhi* compound—‘she whose
*upaskaras*, utensils, are *susaṁskṛta*, ‘well-cleaned.’ Similarly
‘*mukta-hastayā*’ means ‘she whose *hasta*, fist, is *mukta*, open’; and
this is compounded with the negative particle. But apart from its
literal meaning, the word ‘*mukta-hasta*’ denotes, by convention,
*liberality*—(148).

‘*Or her brother with the father’s permission*’— Just as the brother is
entitled to give away the girl only with the father’s permission, so
also is the father entitled to give her away only with the consent of
her mother, though the present text speaks of the father as if he were
free to give her away without consulting anyone else. And the reason for
this lies in the fact that in all things the husband and wife have joint
title, and the daughter belongs to both the parents. In fact in
Discourse IX it is pointed oat that if the father is not alive, the girl
may be given away by the mother. The child is born of both parents, and
on this rests their right over her; hence it is only right that both
should consult each other.

‘*Attend upon*’—Serve.

‘*When he dead*, *she shall not disregard him*.’—‘Disregarding’ means
*not minding*. The meaning is that she should not behave as if she were
her own mistress; just as during her husband’s life-time she is
dependent upon him, so after his death also, she should ever remain
subservient to him. Since it has been declared that—‘the fact that she
has been given away constitutes the ground of his ownership over
her’,—as soon as the father gives away his daughter, his ownership over
her ceases, and then comes into existence the ownership of the man to
whom she is given away. This ‘giving away’ happens not only at the time
of marriage, but even at the time at which the bridegroom is chosen.

“For what purpose then is the *marriage* performed?”

\[The answer is given in the next verse.\]

‘*Good fortune*’ consists in the accomplishment of the desired object;
what brings about this is said to be ‘for that purpose;’ it is for this
that there is ‘sacrifice to Prajāpati.’ The term ‘*maṅgalārtham*’ is in
the neuter form, because it is an adverb.

‘*Svastyayanam*’ is that by which ‘*svasti*’, *welfare*—‘*īyate*’,—*is
secured*; *i.e*. whereby the person’s loved objects do not become lost.

‘*Their*’—of women.

‘*At wedding*’, ‘sacrifice’ is offered to the deity Prajāpati. This
refers to certain offerings of butter that are presented as to be made
at marriage with the *mantras ‘Prajāpate* &c.’ This is only
illustrative: it indicates the other deities also—*e.g*. Pūṣan, Varuṇa
and Aryaman. Indicative also of these other deities are such
mantra-texts as —‘*Puṣannu devam varuṇanna devam*, &c., &c.’

What, the present text, means is that even without the marriage,
ownership is produced by the *giving away*; and no significance is meant
to be attached to the statement that the marriage-sacrifices are
performed only for the purpose of securing good fortune; because
‘marriage’ has been declared to consist in the ‘taking of a wife’; and
even though there may be ownership, the girl does not become ‘wife’
until the marriage is performed.—(150).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

(Verse 152 of others.)

‘*Svastyayanam*’—‘The recitation of benedictory verses’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘the *Puṇyāhavācana* and the rest’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘the recitation
of the texts that precede the nuptial *Homa*’ (Rāghavānanda and
Nandana);—‘that whereby welfare is acquired,’ (Medhātithi who does *not*
connect the word with ‘*yajñaḥ*’).

‘*Prajāpateḥ*’—Medhātithi takes this as ‘referring to the oblations at
marriage to Prajāpati with the mantra *Prajāpate na tvadetanya &c*.’
(Ṛgveda 10.121.10), laid down in certain Gṛhyasūtras;—Nārāyaṇa holds
that ‘*Prajāpatī*’ here stands for Manu, who is the guardian deity of
the bride.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 853),.which adds
the following notes:—‘*Svastyayana*’ means ‘the request to Brāhmaṇas for
the pronouncing of the benedictory syllable
*svasti*,’—‘*Prajāpati-yajña* means ‘the offering of cooked rice into
fire to Prajāpati’;—and in *Vyavahāra Bālambhaṭṭi* (p. 529).

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 130) which adds the following
notes:—‘*Svastyayanam*’ stands for the wearing of gold for the purpose
of passing a happy life, or for the request to Brāhmaṇas for pronouncing
the syllable *svasti*; and the offering ‘to Prajāpati’ is that which is
made during marriage to Prajāpati as the deity;—the ‘*svāmyakāraṇa*’ is
the ‘giving’, the actual *giving away*, not the mere *betrothal*.

152	For the sake of procuring good fortune to (brides), the recitation of benedictory texts (svastyayana), and the sacrifice to the Lord of creatures (Pragapati) are used at weddings; (but) the betrothal (by the father or guardian) is the cause of (the husband's) dominion (over his wife).

It has been more than once explained that women, separated from their
husbands are not entitled to the performance of sacrifices. From this it
follows that, when going to keep an observance or to take to a fast, she
should obtain his permission.

‘*Observance*’ here stands for the vow to give up meat, wine and such
things; it does not stand for the *Kṛcchra* and other penancce; because
the repeating of *mantras* and offering of libertions form part of these
latter, end to these the women is not entitled. It will not be right to
argue here that—“it would be possible for the woman to perform the
*Kṛcchra* and other penances, omitting the mantras and the libations”
because it can never be right to abandon, at one’s will, the details of
a sacrificial performance; specially as it is only the act complete in
all its details that is regarded as lending to prosperity and success.
Nor does the dropping or adding of details depend upon the varying
capacities of performers. Then again, a woman has always available men
of her own caste, among the three higher castes, who could perform for
her the mid acts. For these reasons neither the woman nor the *Śūdra*,
desiring her own welfare, is entitled to the performance of the
*Kṛcchra* and other penances. We shall explain this in detail under the
*Expiatory Rites*.

‘*Fasting*’—living without food, giving up eating for one day. two days
or such limited periods.

^(‘)*Serves*’—attends upon.—(153).

‘*Being desirous*’ of reaching those regions,—‘*she should never do
anything that might be disagreeable*’; *i.e*., such acts as intercourse
with other men and so forth, *which have been forbidden by the

agreeable or disagreeable to the dead person; it is not necessary that
what was agreeable to the living would be agreeable to the dead also;
because notions of pleasure and displeasure vary with the varying
conditions of men. From all this it follows that what is meant by
‘disagreeable’ here is that ‘freedom of life’ which has been forbidden
for women and this the good wife should avoid.—(154).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

What has been said in the preceding verse is explained more specifically
in the present verse.

As in the case of men, so in that of women also suicide is forbidden. As
for what Aṅgiras has said—‘they should die after their husband’,—this
also is not an obligatory act, and so it is not that it must be done.
Because in connection with it there is an eulogium bestowed upon the
results proceeding from such suicide. Thus then, the performing of the
act being possible only for one who is desirous of obtaining the said
result, the act stands on the same footing as the *Śyena* sacrifice.
That is, in connection with the *Śyena* sacrifice we have the Vedic
text—‘one may kill living beings by means of the Śyena sacrifice,’—and
this makes the performance of this sacrifice possible; but only for one
who has become blinded by extreme hatred; so that when the man does
perform the act, it does not become regarded as ‘Dharma,’ a ‘meritorious
act’; exactly in the same manner, when the widow happens to have a very
strong desire for the results accruing from the act of suicide, it is
open to her to disobey the prohibition of it and kill herself; but in so
doing she cannot be regarded as acting according to the scriptures. From
this it is clear that the act of killing herself after her husband is
clearly forbidden for the woman. Further, in view of the distinct Vedic
text—‘one shall not die before the span of his life is run out’—being
contradicted by the Smṛti-text of Aṅgiras, this latter is open to bring
assumed to have some other meaning. Just as in the case of the Smṛti
rule ‘one should take the final bath after having read the Veda’,—the
injunction of the bath, as pertaining to one who has not yet studied the
meaning of the Vedic texts, has been taken as having a different
meaning.

It may happen so that the widow is childless, has not inherited any
property from her husband and has to maintain herself by spinning or
some such work; and she does not wish to marry again, because her
husband was very dear to her and any disregard for him would be against
the scriptures and is even distinctly forbidden; so that knowing that in
abnormal times of distress all transgressions are permissible,—as was
the case when Viśvāmitra partook of the dog’s thigh—she might, being
pinched for a living, be tempted to some transgression. It is with a
view to such a case that the author has put forward the present text.

Under the stated circumstances ‘*well might*’ the woman
‘*macerate*’—reduce—‘*her body*’—‘*by means of flowers, roots and
fruits*’;—*i.e*., she might maintain herself upon these, according as
they may be available; ‘*but she shall not even mention the name of
another man*’—by saying to him ‘you are my husband to-day’.

As for the text—‘When the husband is lost or killed or become a
renunciate, or is found to be impotent, or become an outcast,—under
these five difficulties, another husband is sanctioned for women’
(Parāśara—what is meant is that she may for the purpose of obtaining a
living by doing such work of as that of the *maid* &c., have recourse to
another man *as her protector*,— this being the literal meaning of the
term ‘*pati*’.

This shall he fully dealt with under discourse IX.

This rule also is applicable to the woman whose husband has gone out on
a journey.

The use of the term ‘*kāmam*’—‘well might’—is meant to indicate the
author’s displeasure at the course of conduct suggested; the sense
being—‘the emaciating of the body is bad, and worse still is the set of
having intercourse with another man.’—(155).

What has gone before is further explained.

‘*Till her death she should remain chaste*’;—*i.e*., even under the said
distressing conditions she shall not seek to maintain herself by
misbehaviour.

‘*Patient*’—disregarding the troubles caused by her circumstances, she
shall not allow her chastity to be disfigured by hunger; she shall not
allow her mind to be disturbed by the waves of passion.

The compound ‘*ekapatni* (*ekapatnī*?)’ may be expounded either as
‘those who have a single husband,’ or ‘those who are wives of single
men’; such women, as Sāvitrī and the rest;—the ‘merits’ accruing to such
women; which brings such results as the capacity to confer boons and
pronounce curses;—‘*seeking*’ such merit, the woman should not renounce
chastity.

Under the said circumstances, if, by living upon fruits and roots, she
happen to die,—there would be nothing wrong in this.—(156).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The preceding verse has prohibited intercourse with another man for the
purpose of maintenance; the present verse prohibits it, if betaken to
for the purpose of continuing the race.

It has been declared that ‘there is no heaven for the childless person
(‘aputrasya’).’ But in this sentence no significance attaches to the
masculine gender used. In view of this text a widow might be prompted to
take to another husband; and it is for meeting such a case that we have
the present text.

‘Many thousands of unmarried students’—life-long celebates—‘*have gone
to heaven*’—do go to heaven.

As for the^(‘)*Niyoga*’ that is prescribed for the widow in Discourse
IX, that refers to a case where she is commanded to do so by her elders
and not where she herself desires offspring.

‘*Without having perpetuated their race*’—The begetting of offspring is
for the purpose of perpetuating one’s race; and they did not do it;
*i.e*., they did not beget children.

‘*Many, anekāni*’.—In a negative compound the latter term forms the
predominant factor: hence the use of the plural ending is open to
question. Even though the compound contains the *negation of unity*, vet
plurality is inadmissible. What the word signifies therefore is a very
large number, though its exact nature is not expressed, and the
character of *unity* is abandoned. Just as it is in the case of such
words as ‘*modat*’ (*?*), ‘*grāmaḥ*’ and the like which denote
*multitude*. Says the author of the *Cūrṇikā*—‘The form *anekasmāt*
becomes justified where he has declared the correctness of the use of
the singular number.

Or, the term ‘*aneka*’ may signify^(‘)alone, helpless’; the meaning
being ‘the men who had become helpless by the death of their
wife.’—(157).

These verses sum up the duties of women; and these duties are easily
intelligible; hence I have devoted no attention to the explanation of
these.

The meaning of the teaching is as follows:—Though the man is permitted
(in 167) to take to another wife, yet that does not permit of the woman
taking another husband; because according to the injunction—‘she shall
not disregard him when he is dead’, there can be no possibility of her
marrying again; and by the assertion that ‘even childless persons go to
heaven’ it is made clear that the bearing of children, even in times of
distress, is forbidden. It is only in the *Smṛti* sanctioning ‘*Niyoga*’
that this latter is permitted. Hence in view of these (prohibition and
sanction) the two courses are regarded as optional alternatives; and
between these two *Smṛtis* we cannot determine which is superior and
which inferior; since one of them enjoins the bearing of children, and
the other clearly forbids it. Hence by taking them as optional
alternatives we make room for both—(163-164).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

These verses sum up the duties of women; and these duties are easily
intelligible; hence I have devoted no attention to the explanation of
these.

The meaning of the teaching is as follows:—Though the man is permitted
(in 167) to take to another wife, yet that does not permit of the woman
taking another husband; because according to the injunction—‘she shall
not disregard him when he is dead’, there can be no possibility of her
marrying again; and by the assertion that ‘even childless persons go to
heaven’ it is made clear that the bearing of children, even in times of
distress, is forbidden. It is only in the *Smṛti* sanctioning ‘*Niyoga*’
that this latter is permitted. Hence in view of these (prohibition and
sanction) the two courses are regarded as optional alternatives; and
between these two *Smṛtis* we cannot determine which is superior and
which inferior; since one of them enjoins the bearing of children, and
the other clearly forbids it. Hence by taking them as optional
alternatives we make room for both—(163-164).

The present verse is added with a view to indicate the man’s title to
another marriage; *i.e*., an exception in favour of his wedding another
wife; and it also serves to prohibit the man forthwith taking to the
life of the Recluse or the Renunciate, as soon as he finds himself
deprived of his help-mate and this because he has still got to fulfil
certain duties. Says the *Śruti*—‘He is abandoned by old age, or by the
omission of his duties.’

Others say that a ‘*yadā*’, ‘when’, should be supplied in this verse; so
that there would be no incompatibility between this end the *Śruti*
laying down life-long *Āgnihotra*.—(166).
