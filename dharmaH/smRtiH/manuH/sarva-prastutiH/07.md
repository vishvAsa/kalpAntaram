<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has already been pointed out that the term ‘*Dharma*’ denotes *what
ought to be done, duty*, so what the author promises in the present
verse is that he is now going to describe *what ought to be done by the
King*.

This duty is of two kinds—(1) pertaining to visible things, such as the
‘six courses of action’ and the like, and (2) pertaining to invisible
things, such as the *Agnihotra* and the like. In the present context it
is the former that is chiefly dealt with; and in fact it is only those
forms of activity that are generally known as ‘kingly duties.’

The term ‘*rājan*’, ‘king,’ in the present context, does not stand for
the *Kṣatriya caste*; it stands for that person who fulfills the
conditions of having been anointed, possessing the rights of sovereignty
and so forth. It is for this reason that the *Text* adds—‘*How the Lord
of Men should conduct himself*.’—The use of the term ‘lord of men’
indicates that what is stated here is applicable to the person who has
sovereignty over the people.

The duties expounded in the present connection are based, not all upon
the Veda, but on other sources of knowledge also. Among those based upon
other sources of information, those alone are stated here which are not
contrary to the *Science of Duty* (*Ethics*). Says *Kātyāyana*—‘One
shall renounce the Science of Politics and act according to the Science
of Duty.’

‘*Yathāvṛttaḥ*,’ ‘*how he should conduct himself*’;—the compound is to
be expounded as ‘*yaḍyatprakārakam vā vṛttam yasya*,’ a *Bahuvrīhi*
compound; the third factor referred to by it being the King. If the
compound were explained in the manner whereby the denotation of the
words of the compound itself formed the principal denotation of the
compound itself,—then it would have to be an *Aryayībhāva* (in the form
‘*yathāvṛttam*’).—‘*Conduct*’ stands for the action of protecting the
people and also of accomplishing some transcendental ends.

‘*Coming into existense*’, being created; as is going to be described
under verse 3—‘the Lord created the King’ and so forth.

‘*Excellent*’, highest,—‘*success*’, in the form of undisputed
sovereignty.

This verse states the rewards of the due fulfilment of kingly duties
(1).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 10), which adds
the following notes:—We proceed to consider the exact meaning of the
term ‘*rājan*’,—the question for determination being—(A) Is the name
‘rājā’ applied to any and every one doing the work of ‘protecting the
people?’ (B) or only to one simply belonging to the *Kṣatriya* caste (C)
or to that *Kṣatriya* alone who is duly anointed?

—Now in support of (A) we have the following arguments:—In popular usage
the name ‘*rājā*’ is applied to any one who owns and performs ‘*rājya*,’
the functions of the *rājā*, king; and these functions are actually
performed by the Brāhmaṇa and other castes also. In the *Nirukta* the
etymological meaning of ‘*rājā*’ is explained as ‘*rājate*,’ ‘one who
shines,’ *i.e*.,with royal glory; and this glory results only from the
proper ‘protection of the people.’ The Veda also speaks of *Soma* as
‘the *rājā* of Brāhmaṇas,’ and again as ‘the *rājā* among the
Gandharvas’;—in all these passages the term stands for the ‘lord,’ the
‘protector of the people.’

—In support of (B), the view that the term is applicable to the Kṣatriya
caste, we have the following arguments:—Manu, having introduced the
subject as ‘I am going to describe *Rājadharma*’ goes on to describe
such duties as the protecting of the people and so forth, all of which
pertains to the *Kṣatriya*, as is dear from the next verse which speaks
of ‘protection’ as the principal ‘*rājadharma*’; from all which it is
dear that it is the *Kṣatriya* alone that is entitled to ‘*rājya*,’ the
‘functions of the *Rājā*.’

It is in view of the ‘protection of the people’ being his duty that the
*Kṣatriya* alone is entitled to carry arms and to make a living by arms.
Yājñavalkya clearly declares ‘protecting of the people’ as the
‘principal duty *of the Kṣatriya*.’ Paṇini also lays down the affix
‘*ṣyañ*’ in the term ‘*rājya*’ in the sense of ‘function’ of the *rājā*,
*i.e*., the *Kṣatriya*. Anointing also has been prescribed for the
*Kṣatriya* only; the texts speak of the ‘anointing of the *Rājā*,’ which
means that the ceremony is to be performed by one who is already a Rājā;
and this can be true only of the *Kṣatriya* who alone is a ‘*rājā*’
(*i.e*., Kṣatriya) even *before being anointed*. Thus the primary
denotation of the term resting in the *Kṣatriya* only, whenever it is
applied to such Brāhmaṇas and other castes as do the work of the
‘*rājā*’ it should be understood to be used in a secondary or figurative
sense.

—(C) The third view has been held by Medhātithi and Kulllūka, both of
whom hold that the term is applicable to ‘any man who is equipped with
anointment and such other qualifications, and who does the work of
protecting the people.’ So also Haradatta on Gautamasūtra, and
*Mitākṣarā*, the latter applying it to such ‘Householder as is equipped
with anointment and other qualifications.’ On the ground of commonsense
also the duties laid down for the ‘*Rājā*’ must be taken as pertaining
to every one who has to do the work of ‘protecting the people.’ If they
did not, then what would be there for the guidance of those
*non-Kṣatriyas* who happen to be kings of men? *Aparārka* also declares
that the duties prescribed pertain to these *non-Kṣatriyas* also; though
it holds that the name ‘*rājā*’ is applicable only to that *Kṣatriya*
who has been anointed.

Having stated the arguments for the three views, the author declares his
own conclusion as that the word ‘*rājan*’ in the present context must
apply to *one on whom devolves the duty of protecting the people*;—which
is the first of the three views stated above.

See in this connection the *Aveṣṭyadhikaraṇa* (Mīmāṃsā-sūtra, 2.3.3.),
where the conclusion is that the word ‘*rājan*’ is rightly and directly
denotative of the *Kṣatriya*, and as the ‘protecting of the people’ is
prescribed in law-books as the duty of the *Kṣatriya*, this ‘protection’
has come to be called ‘*Rājya*’ (Kingship) the ‘function of the King’;
and thus when other castes are found, by chance, to perform this
function, they have the title ‘*rājā*’ applied to them only
metaphorically.—As for ‘anointment’, the *Tantravārtika* (Trans. p. 822)
remarks that this also is prescribed for the *Kṣatriya* only. (See in
this connection *Tantravārtika*, Trans. pp. 815-831, where the whole
subject is discussed in detail).

Though such is the conclusion of the Mīmāṃsakas, the commentators on
Manu are agreed that in the present context the term ‘*rājan*’ stands
for any one who performs such functions of the king as ‘protecting the
people’ and so forth. *Aparārka* combines the two views that it applies
to such *Kṣatriyas* as perform the function of protecting the people.

This verse is quoted in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 2 b).

‘*Brahma*’ is Veda; the ‘*training* under gone according to the Veda is
called ‘*brāhma*’ ‘*Vedic*’; that which consists in the learning of the
meaning of the texts by studying the Veda, and which is accomplished in
obedience to the injunction of Vedic study. The Initiatory Ceremony also
is rightly called ‘Vedic’, in view of the fact that it is gone through
for the purpose of getting up the Veda; as the author is going to say
later on (verse 43)—‘From persons learned in the three Sciences he shall
learn the Three-Fold science etc’. If this (learning the meaning of the
Vedic texts) were not meant by the present verse, then it would he
asserting what is already known; as in that case the ‘sacrament’ could
only stand for the forty-eight ‘sacramental rites’ laid down in the
Smṛtis, beginning with ‘Conception’ and ending with the ‘Final
Sacrifice’.

‘*By the Kṣatriya*.’—This indicates that the *Kṣatriya* alone is
entitled to Kingship. In the absence of the *Kṣatriya* however, a
substitute also may be accepted; otherwise the people would become
exterminated (for want of a protector). Such is the sense of the text.

‘*Of all*’—who pay taxes, as well as those who are poor and helpless.

‘*This*’;—this refers to the people living in his kingdom, in villages
as well in cities.

‘*According to law’.—‘Law*’ stands for the scriptures, specially the
scriptures dealing with ‘Dharma’ or Duty, and not those relating to
‘Artha’ or ‘Policy’ and composed by Auśanas and other writers.
‘According to this’—*i.e*., not acting contrary to it.

‘*Protection*’—Guarding; *i.e*., removing troubles, guarding the weak
against the strong, and seeing that they do not act against the law.
‘*Protection*’ means *saving from trouble*; the transgressing of law
brings impercepible trouble; s o that when people do not transgress it,
they become saved from that trouble, by the King. It might be argued
that the punishment inflicted by the King (for transgressions of the
law) is also painful. But the pain caused by such punishment would be
infinitesimal, as compared with the terrible sufferings undergone in
hell.

‘*Shall be done*’;—this is the Injunction.

What prompts and entitles the King to do all this is explained in
Discourse VIII—(2)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Saṃskāram*’—‘*Upanayana*, Initiation’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘Sacrament of Coronation’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 11), in support of
the view that it is the *Kṣatriya* alone whose function it is to protect
the people; and it adds the following notes:—‘*Brahma*’ is *Veda*; and
the ‘*saṃskāra*,’ ‘embellishment,’ ‘aptitude,’ brought about by the
learning, proper study and due understanding of the Veda is called
‘*brāhma*’)—or the ‘*saṃskāra*’ ‘initiation,’ which is undergone for the
purpose of learning the ‘Brahma’ or Veda, is called the ‘*brāhma
saṃskāra*,’ *i.e*., the *Upanayana*;—‘*yathāvidhi*’ means ‘in accordance
with the scriptures;’—this is an adverb modifying ‘*prāptena*’;
‘*yathānyāyam*’ means ‘in strict accordance with the law relating to the
infliction of punishment, going to be set forth
below’;—‘*parirakṣaṇam*,’ ‘guarding the weak against oppression by the
strong.’ This verse shows that the function of *Kingship* belongs
primarily to the *Kṣatriya*.

It is quoted in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 1), which explains ‘*brāhmam
saṃskāram*’ as ‘the anointing done by the Brāhmaṇas.’
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 12).—‘Making gifts,
study, sacrifice,—these constitute the threefold duty of the Kṣatriya;
protecting the people and fighting constitute his livelihood.’

*Yājñavalkya* (Do.).—‘Protecting of the people is the principal duty of
the Kṣatriya.’

*Parāśara* (1.61).—‘The Kṣatriya wielding weapons and protecting people,
having defeated the armies of the enemy, shall protect the earth
according to law.’

*Mahābhārata-Śānti* (Parāśaramādhava-Āchâra, p. OíiO).—‘The protecting
of the people is the highest duty of kings. The king is the protector of
all castes and orders; he should protect his people and direct them to
devote themselves to their own respective duties.’

**(verse 7.3)**

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 391), to the effect
that the king is the representative of the strong hand of the Law;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 5), to the effect that the King comes
down to the earth for the suppression of the thief and other
evil-doers;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 195), as to the effect that
the king was created by Brahmā for the purpose of protecting the
people;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 15), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Arājake*’ means ‘without a king’;—in ‘*sarvataḥ*’ the
affix ‘*tasil*’ has the sense of the Ablative, and the word means ‘from
all strong individuals,’—‘*abhidrute*’ means ‘oppressed,’—‘*asya*’ means
‘of this world’;—‘*prabhu*’ is Brahmā. In some places the reading is
‘*vidrute*’ (for ‘*abhidrute*’), which means ‘fallen off from duty’; and
in this case the affix in ‘*sarvataḥ*’ will have the force of the
Locative.—It then goes on to remark that the reading adopted by
Medhātithi is ‘*cakṣurdharmasya sarvasya*’ (in the place of
*rakṣārthamasya sarvasya*’) under which reading ‘*bhayāt*’ will mean
‘through fear of *adharma*,’—‘*dharmasya cakṣuḥ*’ will be the ‘seer,’
*i.e*., the *propagator* ‘of Dharma,’ *i.e*., the king who is known as
the ‘source of Dharma.’

This is quoted in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 2a).

**(verse 7.4)**

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 6), which
explains that ‘*anila*’ is Vāyu, ‘*vitteśa*’ is Kuvera,—‘*mātrā*’ means
portions—‘*nirhṛtya*’ means ‘extracting,’—‘*śāśvatīḥ*’ means ‘most
essential’ or ‘most lasting.’—It adds that this verse may be construed
with verse 3, the construction being ‘*mātrā nirhṛtya* (verse 4)
*rājānamasṛjat*’ (verse 3).

This is quoted along with verses 5 and 6 in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 4a).

**(verses 7.3-13)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (Parāśaramādhava-Ācāra, p.393)—‘All the deities are
invisible; the king is the only visible deity, whose favour and
disfavour bring about visible results. The king is the father, the
mother and also the family of all those of noble families; the king is
Truth and Deity; and the king is the great benefactor of the people. Let
there be no doubt as to whether the king is the regulator of the time or
time is the regulator of the king; for it is the king who regulates
time. O King! in this world, the virtue of men is guarded by the king;
it is only through fear of the king that people do not devour each
other,’

*Bṛhat-Parāśara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 16).—‘Brahmā created the
king with portions of Indra, Fire, Wind, Yama, Sun, Moon, Varuṇa, Kuvera
and Īśāna.’

*Bṛhat-Parāśara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 20).—‘With or without
cause, having his anger aroused, the king could burn the people; that is
why people knowing the policy of kings call the king *Fire*.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—‘When the king becomes angry, with or without cause, he
burns the people; that is why they call him *Fire*. When the king
desirous of conquest has recourse to valour and marches against enemies,
then is he called *Indra*. The king is called the *Moon* when, on the
disappearance of anger and splendour, he appears before the people in a
happy mood. When the king seated on the seat of judgment, awards
punishments impartially to all creatures, then he is *Yama*. When the
king bestows gifts upon learned men and dependents seeking for help,
then he is called *Kuvera*. As among human beings, the king is without
beginning and without end, and as he is endowed with splendour and
purity, and as he deviates not from the right path, and as an impure man
becomes pure by his word, and the pure becomes impure, wherefore should
not such a king not be a god?’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘Inasmuch as the king *keeps the people pleased*
(*rañjayati*) by means of his four-limbed army, and shines with his
splendid body, he is called the *Raja*.’

*Aṅgiras* (Do.).—‘Inasmuch as the king, by means of punishments, removes
evil he is called the *Guru*.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do.).—‘In countries devoid of a king, Righteousness
obtains no footing and people devour one another; fie, therefore, upon
anarchy! Since the Veda declares the king to be Indra, he should be
honoured by one who desires his own welfare, in the same manner as
Indra. I feel that one should never live in a country where there is no
king. In a country where there is no king, the Fire does not convey
offerings to the gods. Such countries as have no kings are powerless
whenever attacked by enemies.’

*Vālmiki-Rāmāyaṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 20).—‘In a country where
there is no king, there is no safety of life or property; nor is the
enemy able to bear any attack by enemies.’

*Garuḍa-purāṇa* (Do.).—‘Wealthy man, Vedic scholar, king, river, and
physician,—in a place where these five are nor present, one should not
take up residence.’

*Śukranīti* (l.141).—‘The king is made out of the paramount elements of
Indra, Vāyu, Yama, Surya (Sūrya), Agni, Varuṇa, Chandra, and Kuvera; he
is the lord of both the moveable and immoveable worlds.’

‘*These*’—Indra and the other chief Gods;—‘*with the constituent
elements*’—with the particles of their Light constituting their
bodies;—*The ‘King was created*’;—hence his face becomes terrible to
look at;—‘*by his glory*’—on account of his glory.’

He was created after ‘*taking out*’ the essential constituents. The root
‘*kṛṣi*’ (in the term ‘*niṣkṛṣya*’ (in verse 4) denotes ‘*creating*’.
The Ablative (in ‘*mātrābhyaḥ*’) may be explained either on the ground
of the ‘elements’ being the permanent factor out of which the
constituents of the King are taken out. Or we may read ‘*mātrāya*’ with
the Instrumental ending (which would denote cause).—(5)

‘*Burns*’,—as if it were; it is so expressed, in view of the fact that

half.—‘*No one on the Earth*’— not even persons belonging to the
excellent Brāhmaṇa caste, or endowed with Brahmic glory—‘*can gaze at
him*’—*look* at him straight in the face. It is in view of the that it
has been declared that ‘people shall sit down below while the King is
seated on high’ (*Gautama*, 11)—(6)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 16); which
adds the the following explanation:—‘By his lustre he burns, like the
Sun, the eyes and minds of the people that look at him’; though the verb
‘*tapati*’ is in the simple form, it has the sense of the causal; what
is said here is based on the idea that people cannot look the king in
the face; this is the purport of the second half of the verse, which
means that ‘no one on earth can look the king straight in the face.’—It
proceeds—“Medhātithi has remarked that even Brāhmaṇas, who are of
superior caste, and who are endowed with Brahmic glory, cannot look him
in the face”; and he bases this assertion on the words of Gautama (11.7)
that ‘people should sit below the king who sits on high’. This however
is not right, since Gautama has followed up his assertion with the
saving clause ‘*anye brāhmaṇebhyaḥ enam manyeran*’, so that what the
complete *sūtra* of Gautama means is—‘while the king is sitting high
upon the throne, people should sit below, on the ground,—all except the
Brāhmaṇas, and these latter should honour him with benedictions.’

The following verses are commendatory supplements to the foregoing
Injunction. Though the context deals with the ‘Duties of Kings’, yet
what is stated here applies to all men.

When a man touches fire with his hand, or goes too near the fire when it
is burning fiercely,—he is said to be ‘approaching it carelessly’; and
when he is thus careless, he becomes burnt. If, however, the King
happens to be angry, he destroys the man along with his wife, children,
relations and property. In fact; on account of the fault committed by
the master of the house, he destroys all those relations and friends
that may happen to be with the family at the time, along with all their
goods and chattels.—(9)

adds the following notes:—When a man carelessly approaches too near the
fire, he himself alone is burnt, not his sons or other relations;—others
have explained ‘*durupasarpiṇam*’ as ‘one who approaches the fire for
the purpose of throwing himself into it, with a view to escape from
misery’;—better still than both these explanations is the following
one:—‘When a man, knowing himself to be guilty, proceeds, through
bravado, to touch Fire in an ordeal, it is he alone that is burnt by the
fire; but the king, becoming angry with him, destroys the man himself as
well as his son, brother and other members of the family, along with his
cattle and other possessions.’ It is thus alone that the two halves of
the verse become correlated.

One should never think that the King is his relation or friend. ‘To whom
is the King ever a friend, and who are friends to the King?’ (as the
saying goes).

Under the exigencies of business, Kings treat a friend as their enemy,
or an enemy as their friend. Similarly when they feel that they are not
sufficiently strong, they condone faults; and as soon as they feel
strong enough, they destroy the culprit. Similarly he acts according to
the exigencies of time and place.

Thus ‘*for the due fulfilment of hie duty*’—*i.e*., for the
accomplishment of his business —‘*he assumes many forms*’. In a moment
he becomes a friend, and in a moment an enemy; the King never remains
uniform.

For this reason one should never trust the King; that is, either by
reason of friendship, or of kindness, or of good nature, or of sameness
of age, one should not behave towards him as an equal. He should always
be treated with caution.—(10)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

When he is pleased at service rendered to him, he grants wealth; when he
is angry, he inflicts death. Hence he who desires wealth should serve
him with care. When he is pleased with a man, he does not merely bestow
wealth on him, but also subdues and destroys his enemies. For this
reason also, if a man desires the destruction of his enemy, he should
try to please the King.

‘*Padma*;’—though this term is synonymous with ‘*Śri*’ (a name of the
Goddess of Fortune, yet in the present text it has been used in the
sense of *greatness*; t he sense being that the King bestows large
wealth.

All these things are obtained from the King, because ‘*he contains in
himself the splendour of all*’—*i.e*., of the Sun, the Moon and
Fire.—(11)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Padmā*’—‘Carrying a lotus in her hand’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘dwelling in the
lotus (Rāghavānanda);—‘the great, the magnificent’ (Medhātithi,
Govindārāja and Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18) which adds the following notes:—When a
man seeks for fortune, or having an enemy seeks to destroy him,—or seeks
for livelihood,—he has recourse to the king;—Medhātithi and others have
remarked that the term ‘*padmā*’ being a synonym of ‘*Śrī*’, is added
for the purpose of indicating *greatness*; that is to say, the term
‘*padmā*’ is superfluous;—in reality however it is ‘*padmā*’ that stands
as a name for the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, and the term ‘*śrīḥ*’
stands for ‘bodily splendour or we may construe the words as
follows:—‘In whose favours rests Padmā, the goddess of fortune, and in
whose valour rest resplendence (*śriḥ*) and victory (*vijayaḥ*).’

The King shall be kept pleased, not so such with a view to obtaining
desirable things from him, as for saving oneself from trouble; this is
what is reiterated by the text.

He who is hostile to the King,—*i.e*., acts against him—‘*he doubtlessly
perishes*’; ‘*because, for his quick destruction*.’ *etc*.—Other men may
forgive a fault, on account of the difficulties involved in complaining
of it to the King; which involves expenditure of money, where
difficulties crop up again and again by reason of the freaks of
witnesses and so forth; but in the case of the King himself, there is no
such difficulty; and when once he makes up his mind to destroy a man,
the man is surely ruined; the King being all-powerful; and further, if
he were to appear like making special efforts for chastising such a man,
this (show of weakness) would militate against his puissance (?).—(12).

Because the King ‘contains within himself the splendour of all,’
therefore,—‘*in favour of his favourites*’— towards those ministers,
priests and others who are in favour,—whenever in course of business, a
‘*decree*’— an ordinance, in consonance with Law and Custom—is ordained
or issued by the King;—no one should transgress such a decree. Such a
decree of the King’s should not be disobeyed; such a decree for instance
us—‘To-day, the city should observe a holiday—there is a marriage in the
minister’s house,—all men should be present there,—no animals shall be
slaughtered to-day by the soldiers,—no birds are to be caught,—for so
many days dancing girls shall be entertained by all wealthy men.’

Similarly ‘*against those in disfavour*’,—such a decree as—‘no one shall
associate with this person,—no one should allow him to enter his house’.

When such decrees are issued by the King by the beat of drum etc. they
shall not be transgressed. But the King has no power to control the
ordinances pertaining to religions acts, such as. the *Agnihotra* and
the like, of the orders and castes. Such control would be repugnant to
other *Smṛti* texts; and the present text has its application, without
offending against any *Smṛti* text, in cases indicated above.—(13).

should never transgress any lawful and fair commands that his majesty
may issue in regard to his minister, priest or other favourites;—such
commands for instance as—‘To-day should be observed by all the people as
a day of rejoicing, there is a marriage in the minister’s house, all
should be present there, butchers shall kill no animals today, no birds
are to be caught, no debtors are to be imprisoned by their creditors’
and so forth \[these in regard to the king’s favourites.\]—Similarly in
regard to one whom he dislikes, he may issue such orders as—‘none shall
associate with him, he should not be permitted to enter any household,’
and so forth.—Such rules promulgated by the king should not be
disobeyed. In regard to the performance of the *Agnihotra* and such
religious acts, however, the king has no right to interfere at all.

The origin of the King has been described; the origin of Punishment is
now described.

‘*For his sake*’— for the due fulfilment of the purposes of the
King,—‘*the Lord*’—Prajāpati—‘*created Punishment*’.

“What purpose of the King is served by Punishment?”

The answer is as follows—It is ‘*the protector of all creatures*’;—it is
Punishment that ‘*protects*’—guards—all creatures; as without Punishment
the King cannot carry on the work of protecting the people. Thus it was
for the proper accomplishment of the kingly function that Punishment was
created.

\(a\) ‘*It is Law*, (*b*) *born of the Lord himself*, (*c*) *incarnation
of divine glory*’.—(*a*) ‘Law’ does not consist of sacrifices and gifts;
it consists of Punishment, (*b*) Nor should it be regarded as an
inferior form of Law, by reason of its depriving men of their life and
property because it is that Law which is born out of the body of the
Lord, Prajāpati, himself, (*c*) Nor is it composed of the five material
substances; it is created out of the pure^(‘)glory’ of Brahman himself.

‘*At* *fir* *st*,’—before the creation of the King himself,—(14)

‘*Through fear* *of* *him*.’—As mere relationship in general is meant to
be expressed (and Punishment is not meant to be spoken of as the actual
*source* of fear), we have the Genitive (and not the Ablative) ending in
‘*tasya*’. It is through fear of Punishment that immovable beings
*Subserve (lie experiences of men*—become capable of helping in their
enjoyment, by means of flowers, fruits, shade and so forth. The
immovable being (tree) that does not bear fruit either dries up: or if
it does not dry up, it spreads all over the place and is cut up and made
into coal.

By citing the case of the ‘immovable things’ it is meant that such
should be the treatment meted out to the person who is found to be
deserving of punishment on account of his having done something wrong to
the King; that he should he punished with cutting, uprooting (total
destruction) and the like.

The mention of the ‘immovable beings’ is for the purpose of eulogising,
by its example, the Punishment; the sense being ‘Punishment is such a
thing that it is inflicted even upon immovable things, what to say of
movable ones?’—and it is not meant that Punishment is actually inflicted
upon immovable things.

‘*Do not swerve from their duty*’—*i.e*., they do not flower or fruit
out of their proper season.—(15).

be expressed is *relationship in general* (and not the fact of being a

Those ‘*who act unlawfully*,’—*i.e*., do things harmful to the
King.—*i.e*., such persons as the Chief Minister and others,—it is the
punishment to be inflicted upon such men that is described now. As
regards persons who behave unlawfully towards one another, the
punishment to be inflicted is going to be described under VIII. 126,
where it is said—‘Having ascertained the motive &c &c.’; and the present
verse also we have explained under that text. One additional factor
introduced in the present text is ‘*learning*’, which stands for *Vedic
learning*.

‘*Appropriately*’—according as each man may deserve.

‘*Mete out*’—inflict, bestow.

Punishment should be meted out after having fully considered all that is
here mentioned. If inflicted in any other way, it would bring
perceptible trouble to the King.

The two (similar) verses occurring in discourses VII and VIII differ in
the following respects—(*a*) one refers to visible (worldly) matters and
the other to invisible (super-physical) ones, and (*b*) one refers to
the King’s servants and the other to his people.—(16)

hearts of the people;—he is the *netā*, the ‘leader’, the propagator of
*Dharma*,

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261), which has the following notes:—*Rājā*, so
called because he keeps the people contented (),—*puruṣaḥ*, the Supreme
Person, because he abides in the heart (*puri shete*) of the
people,—*nètā*, - ruler, master,—‘*śāsitā*’, the propagator of proper

*Yājñavalkya* (1.352).—(See under l5.)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.367).—‘The king shall inflict punishment upon those who
deserve it, after duly taking into consideration, the crime, the place
and the time, as also the strength, age, act and wealth of the culprit,’

*Gautama* (12.51).—‘The award of punishment should be regulated by a
consideration of the status of the criminal, of his bodily strength, of
the nature of the crime and whether the offence has been repeated.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19, 9-10).—‘Punishment should be awarded in cases of assault
and abuse after due consideration of the particular place and time, of
the duties, age, learning, and the sect; in accordance with the
scriptures and in accordance with precedents.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.91, 92).—‘He should inflict punishments, corresponding to the
nature of their offences, upon evil-doers. He should inflict punishments
according to justice.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 255).—‘The king should
inflict punishment after due enquiry; everything rests upon punishment.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 32).—‘Punishment is the means whereby the security of
the science of philosophy, Vedic triad and Trade-Agriculture is
obtained.’

*Śukranīti* 1.45-47).—‘Through fear of punishment meted out by the king,
each man gets into the habit of following his own Dharma. The person who
follows his own Dharma can become powerful and influential in this
world. With strict adherence to one’s own duty, there can he no
happiness. Poliowing one’s own Dharma is the highest penance.’

That in reality is ‘*King*’;—as it is by reason of Punishment that the
King’s power holds.

That is the ‘*Man*’;—since it disregards even powerful men and brings
them under its power.

That is the ‘*Leader*’;—all business is led, managed, by it.

‘*Ruler*’—‘Ruling’ consists in the King’s commands; and these latter are
capable of controlling men only when there is Punishment; and it is in
this sense that the actual act of *ruling* has been figuratively
attributed to it.

It is like ‘*surety*’ of ‘*the Law of the Four Stages*’;—*i.e*.,
Punishment does not allow men to swerve from their duty in the same
manner as the surety does not allow the party to deviate from the
stipulated conditions.—(17)

It is not the King that administers the law, relating to the Injunction

‘*Punishment alone protects*’— the weak against the strong.

‘*While all*’—King’s officers—‘*are asleep*’— it is only through fear of
punishment that people desist from doing what they like.

There are two kinds of this Punishment,—(*a*) that inflicted by the King

Further, ‘the *rights of ownership*’—the relation of possessor and

husband and wife; the husband would cease to be the husband of the wife,
and women would go about independently by themselves.

‘*Confusion among the high and low*’;—the ‘low,’ *e.g*., the *Caṇḍāla*

A man who, by his very nature, is ‘*guileless*’, in matters relating to
duty, wealth and pleasures, is ‘*hard to find*,’ can be met with
difficulty. In fact, it is ‘*by punishment*’ that a man is ‘*kept under
control*’, kept firm in the right path; through fear of it, he does not
give free vent to his desires.

‘*The world subserves etc*.’—This has been already explained (under

‘Devas’—*i.e*., the God of Rain, of Wind, the Sun and so forth.

‘*Subserve the experiences’—e.g*., by periodic heat, cold and rain, help
in the development of the herbs and so forth.

All this is due to their being afraid of being punished. If it were not
so, why should the Sun and the Moon, or Brahmā and the God of Rain, not
swerve from their appointed task? If the Sun were not under some such
control, he might not rise at all for two or three days; from fear of
punishment, however, he never transgresses the prescribed limits. Says
the Śruti text—‘It is through fear that the Sun shines, it is through
fear that the Moon shines, and it is through fear that Fire and Wind
(function.)’

That the Dānavas and other evil spirits do not go on destroying the
Universe all day and night, is due to the power of punishment. That the
birds that adorn households—such as the parrot and the rest—do not take
out the eyes of children,—that kites, crows, vultures and eagles do not
devour the young children,—this also is due to the same cause.

Reptiles, serpents, abounding as they do, in anger and poison, do not
all gather together and sting all living beings,—this also is due to the
power of punishment.

For these reasons the text has provided this eulogy on punishment that,
when even the extremely powerful gods and the rest, and the
non-intelligent things also do not swerve from their appointed path,
through fear of punishment,—what to say of human beings!

In this connection the ancients have quoted the following verse—‘Seeing
the humble position of the wild *Pāṭala* -tree, and the flamboyant
floral display of the *Kutaja*,—by this subversion of relation he
laughed (thinking) that even the low-born strikes at an opening’.

‘*Mistakes regarding punishment*’—*i.e*., its non-infliction, or its
infliction in an unlawful manner. If there were any such, then ‘*all the
castes would become corrupt*’; as unrestricted intercourse would lead to

‘*Barriers*’— bounds—‘*would be broken through*’;—all restrictions would
disappear; *Brāhmaṇas* would behave like *Śūdras* and *Śūdras* like

These two are most praiseworthy for men (?). The author eulogises
punishment by means of an imaginary metaphor.

Punishment is of two kinds—one kind inspires fear, and another brings
pain; the former is indicated by the ‘*dark completion*’ and the latter
by the ‘*red eyes*’.

The praise of punishment has been furnished.

Punishment should be inflicted, but with due consideration of the
exigencies of time, place &c. Apart from this all else is purely
commendatory.

‘*Provided that the governor*—he who metes out the punishment
—‘*discerns rightly*’; *i.e*., rules over the people after due
consideration of time, place &c.—‘*the people are not misled*’— do not
become affected by any evil.—(25).

The justness of the governor consists in the following qualities—(*a*)
truthfulness, (*b*) the habit of doing things after due consideration,
(*c*) wisdom and (*d*) a true discernment of the three aims of man.

‘*Truthful of speech*’—*he* who, having inflicted the punishment in due
accordance with Law, does not enhance it on becoming apprised of the
fact of the culprit being a very wealthy person,—or does not reduce it
through considerations of friendship towards him.

‘*Wise*’—he who fully understands the mutual effects of time, place &c
and their special relations; sometimes the effect of the time is
nullified by that of place, and *vice-versa*; or both these are
nullified by considerations of Learning and Power; and who also
recognises the special relations among them, as regards their wider or
more restricted application. Under certain circumstances what has been
the nullifier before becomes the nullified. So that *wisdom* is
necessary for the proper discernment of this; and also for recognising
the relative importance or non-importance of virtue, pleasure and
wealth. For instance, if it is found that the acquiring of a little
virtue would lead to a great evil (discomfort or loss of wealth), that
virtue may be abandoned; and this abandonment may be expiated by
penances.—(26).

there is no other means save punishment for the subjugating of living
beings. Such is not the view of kauṭilya; for if a king is very severe

lenient, he is disregarded; he is respected only when he inflicts
punishment impartially in the right manner. If intelligently
administered, punishment brings prosperity and happiness to the people;
if improperly administered, through ignorance, or greed, or anger, it
angers even Hermits and Renunciates; what to say of Householders? The
people consisting of the four castes and orders is protected by the king
through punishment.’

Punishment is a tremendous force; and it cannot be properly administered
by persons who have not been disciplined by the study of the scriptures
and the service of teachers, or by inborn humility.

One should not entertain the idea that ‘punishment can be meted out by
mere word of command, and there is no difficulty in controlling it;
because if a King is not careful with regard to it, and does not devote
special attention to it, he commits mistakes, and is, on that account,
destroyed by the Punishment, along with hi relatives. The King is struck
down not only physically by himself, but along with his whole family of
sons and grandsons.—(28).

here stands for the *son*,—and that ‘*sumahat tejaḥ*’ refers to its

When Punishment is inflicted without due consideration of time, place
&c., there is destruction of the whole kingdom along with the King and
together with all animals and immovable things. Hence the King has to be
warned of this by his ministers and his people; or these latter should
leave the kingdom.

The sages and the gods are also afflicted:—the gods live upon offerings
made by the inhabitants of the earth; hence when, on account of the
disruption of the kingdom, there is no proper performance of sacrificial
acts &c., the gods and the sages are as good as ‘destroyed.’ Says the
author of the Purāṇas—

‘Whatever is done by persons of the various castes and stages, that has
been declared to be the source of maintenance for persons of divine
origin in heaven and the other regions’.

The upshot of all that has been said from the first verse to this is as
follows:—‘The kingdom has got to be ruled by a Kṣatriya of impartial
mind;—this cannot be done without punishment; hence this should be meted
out, in his own kingdom as also elsewhere, in strict accordance with the
Law, after a full investigation of the exigencies of time and place &c.,
relating to each case;—if it is inflicted otherwise, there is
destruction of both worlds.’

The rest of it all is purely a commendatory supplement.—(29)

The present section is taken up for the purpose of indicating the
necessity of associating assistants with one’self (one’s self?).

A King who is not helped by assistants, in the shape of able
councillors, army-commanders, administrators of justice,—all which are
going to be described,—cannot justly administer punishment alone by
himself; even though he be fully endowed with all necessary qualities of
justice and expediency. ‘Justice’ consists in decision that is in due
accordance with Law and is in keeping with the peculiarities of time,
place &c.

For this reason it is necessary for the King to employ properly
qualified assistants.

The meaning is that punishment cannot be justly administered by the King
without assistants,—just as it cannot be administered by one who is
foolish or demented, or whose mind is not properly trained, or who is
addicted to sensual objects, or is avaricious—and hence confiscates
people’s property in an unjust manner. It can be rightly administered
only by persons possessed of qualities that are tṇe reverse of
these.—(30).

This same idea is expressed obversely in the next verse.

‘*Pure*’—not covetous.

‘*True to his word*’—who attaches great importance to truth; who, in all
his acts, places truth in the fore-front; which means that he has his
senses under control; for how can there be any truthfulness in one whose
senses are not subdued?

‘*Who acts according to the Law*’,—‘*who has good assistants* whose
assistants are properly qualified; *i.e*., assisted by such assistants
as are not illiterate, and who are devoted to him.

‘*Wise*’—intelligent;—this is the reverse of the ‘demented’ person
mentioned in the preceding verse.

Thus he who is equipped with these five qualities, and free from the
corresponding five contrary qualities, is the person entitled to
administer punishment, and to partake of the visible (physical) and
invisible (moral) results proceeding therefrom. Such is the sense of
these two verses.—(31).

The name ‘*own kingdom*’ is based upon the fact of the territory having
been inherited from one’s forefathers; *e.g*., Kāśmīra would be ‘own
kingdom’ for the King of Kāśmira, Pāñcāla would be ‘own Kingdom’ tor the
King of Pāñcāla; and so forth Therein ‘he shall be of just behaviour’,
*i.e*., act with justice;—he who behaves with justice is said to be ‘of
just behaviour’; the compound being expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*.

‘*Nyāyavṛttiḥ*’ is another reading.

The foregoing clause having reiterated what has been already enjoined
before, the Author enjoins ‘rigorous chastisement’ towards enemies. The
sense is that he shall attack the enemy’s territories outright, not
waiting for any such favourable opportunity as the enemy being beset
with difficulties or attacked by other kings. By acting thus, the king
acquires a glamour of glory; and to one who has attained this glamour,
the enemies bow down.

Towards all *Brāhmaṇas*, he shall be ‘*tolerant*’; *i.e*., even when
they have committed an offence, punishment shall be meted out to them in
a merciful, and not a revengeful, spirit.

When a king is attacking another kingdom, he does not destroy the
inhabitants of that realm, if it is at all possible to save them.

Towards ‘*loved friends*’ he shall be ‘*straightforward*’— free from
duplicity. One who helps in the accomplishment of the king’s business,
and who regards his business as his own and who looks upon his
prosperity and adversity as his own, is his ‘loved friend’.—(32).

stateliness of stature, superior might, self-control, ingenuity in
inventing means and instruments of torture, perfection in all arts,
ability to reclaim men from evil ways, power of sustaining assaults from
enemies, knowledge of remedies against danger, promptness in detecting
the weak points of the enemy, familiarity with the nature of war and
peace, strict observance of secrecy regarding all counsel and action,
proficiency in utilising place and time, collection of money and its
proper expenditure, deep insight into the nature of dependants, freedom

tyranny, depravity, animosity, jealousy and falsehood,—compliance with
the advice of elders,—learning, energy, amiable appearance, appreciation
of people’s worth and smiling words;—these are the indispensable
qualifications of a sovereign.’

Do. (6.8).—‘Thus knowing what is just and what unjust, and abiding by

Do. (14.13).—‘A king hard in inflicting punishment excites the people;
thus harassed, they seek the protection of the enemy.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.96).—‘In his own domain, the king shall inflict punishments
according to justice, chastise foreign foes with rigour, behave without

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 31).—‘Sticking to one’s own duty leads to Heaven and
Immortality; neglecting thereof leads to confusion and ruin. Therefore
the king shall never disturb the specific duties of living beings. By
remaining firm in his own duty, he is happy here as also after death;
the people are contented, never discontented, if the rules of gentility
are duly observed, and if they are protected according to the three
Vedas.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.333).—‘To his dependants and to his people, the king
shall be as father; lenient towards Brāhmaṇas, straightforward to his
affectionate friends, rigorous towards enemies.’

*Śukranīti* (1.52-54).—‘From the very moment that a man attains the
position of a king through skill, might or valour,—no matter whether he

Do. (1.59.62).—‘The king who protects his people and is

The King has been created as the protector of people intent upon their
duties; so that if the King fails to protect those who are engaged in
their duties, he incurs sin: on the other hand, if those who have
swerved from their duty happen to be attacked by some person, this would
not entail any grievous offence on the part of the King. This is what is
meant by the phrase ‘*respective duties*’

Or, the passage may he construed as containing a negative particle
prefixed to the term ‘*niviṣṭānām*’, which is to be read as
‘*a-niviṣṭanam*’, ‘*not conversant*.’ The meaning in this case would be
that ‘the king shall not adopt a hostile attitude towards those persons
who are not conversant with their duties through the scriptures or
through the advice of friends and others’.

The term ‘caste’ has been added for the purpose of securing protection
for women and children also,—these not belonging to any ‘order.’

In that case why should the orders have been mentioned?”

It is for the purpose of indicating their predominance that they have
been separately mentioned; the expression being analogous to such
expressions us ‘*Brāhmaṇa-Vāśiṣṭha* (the Brāhmaṇas and *those of the
race of Vaśiṣṭha*, where the latter, though included among ‘Brāhmaṇas’
are mentioned separately with a view to indicate their importance).

Or, the particular form of the expression may have been adopted for the
purpose of indicating the motive (of protection); the sense being that
they should be protected in such a way that they do not deviate from
their duties in the shape of proceeding from stage to stage, saying of
the Twilight Prayers and so forth; in the performance of their ordinary
duties they shall not be permitted to be struck with a stick etc. by
other people, for if this protection were not vouchsafed, there would be
no end to troubles and difficulties. This is the ‘protection’ that is
meant here.

Nor should people be allowed to interfere with the fulfilment of such
caste-duties as the saying of the Twilight Prayers and the like. Thus a
twofold duty rests upon the King; hence the mention of both ‘castes’ and
‘orders.’

This is what is meant by the words of Gautama—‘He shall protect
according to Law, the castes and orders’ (11-9).—(35).

*Kāmandaka* (2.35).—‘The king promoting the Varṇas and Āśramas and
living according to these usages, and knowing their duties, becomes

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rāja, p. 121),—‘The highest duty of the
king consists in keeping all the castes fixed to their respective
duties; hence he should devote his attention to that. Those who have
deviated from their duties, the king shall make revert thereto.’

*Viṣṇu* (Vīramitrodaya-Rāja, p. 121).—‘Keeping all the castes firm in

‘*In the morning*, *having risen*’—having left the bed and having said
the Twilight Prayers in the prescribed manner,—he shall, first of all,
grant an audience to the *Brāhmaṇas*.

‘*Waiting upon*’ stands for making them sit dose by and making enquiries
regarding their welfare.

The prefix ‘*pari*’ has been added only for the filling up of the metre.

‘*Shall follow their advice*’. If they should happen to press for a
favour for some one, their motive should not be suspected, nor should
anything wrong be done.

‘*Accomplished students of the Threefold Science*’. The aggregate of the
three Vedas is called ‘Threefold Science’: those who have studied these
are called ‘*students of the Threefold Science*’, *i.e*., those who have
studied the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda and the Sāmaveda.

‘*Learned*’—Those who know what is contained in the Vedas.

The King shall wait upon Brāhmaṇas thus qualified; and shall act up to
their behests.

‘*Accomplished*’—those who are the best, possessed of the most excellent
qualifications, among them, in regard to the said knowledge and
learning.—(37).

‘*Elderly*’—aged—Brāhmaṇas. This alone is something new enjoined here;
all the rest of it, ‘Brāhmaṇas’ and so forth, is what has been already
declared before.

‘Pure’—free from defects. This also is something new; the meaning being
that ‘purity’ is as good a reason for being honoured as ‘knowledge and
learning.’

The second half of the verse is purely commendatory.

‘*By Rākṣasas*’—As a rule, *Rākṣasas* are pitiless, very powerful and
devoid of all virtues; and yet. even these honour the person who waits
upon elderly men.—(38).

explained ‘*śucīn*’ is ‘free from guile’;—Medhātithi adds that this
qualification also is one that has not been mentioned elsewhere; but
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa holds that all the rest are only qualifications of
‘*viprān*’ \[so that Brāhmaṇas alone are meant\];—the meaning of the
second line is that ‘the king is respected also by those reckless,
merciless ruffians who are devoid of all virtues, not say by ordinary

‘*Though his mind be already disciplined*’;—though he may be already
disciplined by his own will, or by the proper study of political
science,—yet he should carefully attend to the advice of elderly
persons; because men with practical experience are better experts than
those possessing only theoretical knowledge. Or even though highly
trained, he shall train his mind under elderly qualified men, for the
purpose of making his aptitude keener. Just as gold, even though pure by

What has been stated above is further emphasised by means of the next
three verses.

Undisciplined kings, have perished ‘*along with their belongings*’.
‘*Belongings*’ stand for the son, wife, elephants, horses and so forth.

On the other hand, those who are disciplined never lose their kingdom,
after having got it; in fact even when living far off in the forest, and
hence devoid of any treasure &c., they have obtained kingdoms.’—(40).

VERSE (42)

But through discipline pṛthu and manu obtained kingdoms, kubera obtained
the lordship of wealth and the son of gādhi attained brāhmaṇahood.—(42)

‘*The son of Gadhi* (*Gādhi*?) *attained Brāhmaṇahood*.’—

where was the occasion for citing an instance of the attaining of
*Brāhmaṇahood?* It was necessary to cite cases of the obtaining of

Our answer is that as a matter of fact a higher caste is more difficult
to attain than sovereignty over riches; because the higher caste carries
with it all its privileges.

“Vena is often taken as a type of an undisciplined king. He was the son
of Sunīthā and father to Pṛthu......Nahuṣa, son of Āyuṣ (the Mahābhārata
I and V), was ruined by love and ambition... Sudās was king at the time
of the great Vaśiṣṭha, and a leader of the Tṛtsu (Ṛgveda VII. 18)...
Sumukha is unknown to me. Nimi is said to be a Videha king”—Hopkins.

Gharpure notes the following references to the *Mahābhārata*;—(1)
Droṇaparva (69);—(2) Śāntiparva (28-137, 58-102);—(3) Ādiparva (63-5,
69-29);—(4) Udyogaparva (101-12);—(5) Bhīṣmaparva (6-14);—(6)
Sabhā-parva (8-9). These are meant to refer respectively to the six
kings mentioned in the text.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), which notes
that Sudāsa was the son of Paijavana.

‘*The son of Gadhi* (*Gādhi*?) *attained Brāhmaṇahood*.’—

*Objection*—“*In* connection with the subject of Kings and kingdoms,
where was the occasion for citing an instance of the attaining of
*Brāhmaṇahood?* It was necessary to cite cases of the obtaining of
kingdoms only, as was done in the first half of the verse.”

Our answer is that as a matter of fact a higher caste is more difficult
to attain than sovereignty over riches; because the higher caste carries
with it all its privileges.

*Objection*—“But how can, *vinaya*, discipline, be the cause of that?
‘Discipline’ consists in such qualifications as—the proper employment of
the six means of success, alertness, thrift, non-avariciousness, freedom
from evil habits, and so forth; and not one of these can be the cause of
bringing about Brāhmaṇahood. In fact Austerity has been declared to be
the cause of that, in such texts as—‘Viśvāmitra practised austerities
with the view that he may not remain the son of a non-sage’ and so
forth.”

Our answer is as follows:—The ‘*Naya*’, ‘conduct’, here spoken of (as
‘*Vinaya*’, ‘discipline’), is not what has been described in the Science
of Politics; it is what has been enjoined in the scriptures and is
observed in ordinary practice; and in the scriptures it has been laid
down that ‘by means of Austerity, the higher caste is attained during
another life’; while in the case of Viśvāmitra, Brāhmaṇahood was
attained during the same life in which he was a *Kṣatriya*, as has been
described in the books.—(42)

“Pṛthu (*cf*. 9.44) was the title of several gods as well as kings. The
one meant is probably he whose happy reign is described in the 7th and
12th books of the Mahābhārata. Manu needs only an exclamation \[Hopkins
evidently forgets (1) that the person speaking is not *Manu* himself,
and (2) that there have been several Manus\]. ‘Kubera was god of wealth
and Gādhi’s son was Viśvāmitra who was born a Kṣatriya.”—Hopkins.

Gharpure refers to the Mahābhārata, Śāntiparva (58-107) and Bhāgavata

If we read ‘*vidyām*’ with the Accusative ending (instead of ‘*vidyāt*’,
the Injunctive verb), it will have to be construed with ‘*Adhigacchet*’,
‘shall learn’ (of verse 39).

In as much as it is laid down that the King is to be anointed only after
he has passed through the stage of studentship, during which the Vedas
will have been already learnt,—the present injunction is to be taken as
pertaining to his continuing his study.

‘*The three-fold science*’ is that science which has three component
parts; and he who learns this is said to be ‘versed in the three-fold
science’;—from these he shall learn the ‘*Triad*’,—*i.e*., the three
Vedas, the Ṛk. and the rest. That is, in all doubtful matters, he shall
decide with the help of the Vedas; and he shall discuss the exact
meaning of Vedic texts with the said learned persons; end he ahull not
disregard knotty points thinking himself to be a powerful King and hence
influenced by pride and haughtiness.

‘*Also the Science of Government*’;—the science relating to ‘*daṇḍa*’,
and ‘*daṇḍa*’ is *ruling*, *governing*; that whereby enemies as also
people inhabiting his own kingdom, when doing wrong, are kept in check;
and this ‘governance’ consists in the employment of suitable ministers
&c. The ‘science’ of this consists of the rules pertaining to it. This
also he shall learn from persons versed in it, and knowing the works of
Cāṇakya and other writers.

‘*Ancient*’;—this is purely eulogistic.

Though with the help of the Science of Government alone he may be enable
to know the entire world, yet, in as much as that science is based upon
induction, and the Science of Reasoning serves the purpose of bringing
intelligence to the dull and corroboration to the intelligent,—it is
necessary to supplement the said science with the Science of Reasoning,
as also the Science of Politics and so forth; so also the Science of the
Soul.

Or the terms ‘*ānvīkṣikī*’ and ‘*ātmavidyā*’ may be construed together;
the meaning being—‘that Science of Reasoning which is beneficial to
one’s self’;—that he should learn; as it is only such beneficial science
that can be useful to him, in subjugating evil habits, misfortunes and
mental disturbances. As for the Science of Reasoning propounded by the
*Buddhas, the Carvākas* and other atheists, they cannot be of much use
to him; on the contrary, they are likely to shake his faith, if he does
not happen to be exceptionally intelligent.

When the king learns the Science of Reasoning by itself, then he becomes
capable of employing choice language in hie communications with
envoys;—so that he does not become open to ridicule.

‘*The Art of Commerce*’.—The acquiring of the knowledge of
market-commodities, and the knowledge of trade-methods, with the help of
Bṛhaspati’s work, constitutes ‘Commerce’: and activity pertaining
thereto constitutes the ‘Art of Commerce’; that ie, learning the
theories of commerce and then putting them into practice.

This he shall learn from ‘*experts*’—*i.e*., persons making a living by
trade; these alone are ‘experts’ in matters relating to commerce.

The term ‘*from experts*’ may be construd (construed?) with the two
preceding terms (‘Science of Reasoning’ and ‘Science of Soul’) also; so
that we get at the meaning that all these three are to be learnt from
men expert in them.—(43)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.310), which, reads
‘*ātmavidbhyo*’ (for ‘*ātmavidyām*’) and hence avoids the confusion felt
by the commentators on Manu;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 222), which
explains ‘*daṇḍanīti*’ as ‘*Arthaśāstra*’, ‘Science of
Polity’,—‘*vārtā*’ as ‘agriculture, commerce, cattle-tending and so
forth’,—and ‘*trayī*’ as ‘Ṛk, Yayuṣ and Sāman’;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Rājanīti, p. 118), which notes the reading ‘*vidyām*’, in which case,
it says, the whole is to be construed with ‘*adhigaccet*’ of verse
39;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 36a);—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p.

in Agricultural Science and in the Threefold Science (Vedas).’

*Arthaśāstra* (pp. 34-35).—‘The discipline of the sciences is obtained
through the authority of the professors of each; for the sake of this
discipline one should always remain in constant touch with those learned
in the sciences.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.59, 63, 66).—‘Association with the Preceptor bestows
knowledge of the scriptures; knowledge of the scriptures increases
humility. A king who is modest under culture never sinks under
calamities. A king well-versed in polity, practising self-control, very
soon attains to that shining pitch of prosperity that has been attained
by other divine kings. The Preceptor is worshipped for the acquisition
of learning; learning which has been mastered becomes instrumental in
enhancing the prudence of the illustrious; and the habit of acting by
prudence leads to prosperity.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.1 *et. seq*.)—‘The king after having controlled his
senses, should direct his attention to the cultivation of the following
branches of learning—*Ānvīkṣikī* (Logic), *Trayī* (Vedic Triad) *Vārtā*
(Trade-Agriculture) and *Daṇḍanīti* (Science of Government). The
followers of Manu hold that there are only three divisions of
learning—Vedic Triad, Trade-Agriculture, and Science of Government;
according to them Logie is only a branch of the Vedic Triad. The
followers of Bṛhaspati postulate only two divisions:—Agriculture and
Science of Government; as only these help men in acquiring wealth.
According to Uśanas the Science of Government is the only division; the
origin of all other forms of learning lies in this. But according to our
own teacher, there are four branches :—*Ānvīkṣikī* deals with the
knowledge of the self, *Trayī* with Dharma and Adharma (right and
wrong), *Vārtā* with the acquiring and spending of wealth, and
*Daṇḍanīti* with justice and injustice. *Ānvīkṣikī*, *Trayī* and *Vārtā*
are excellent forms of knowledge; but they are of no avail if
*Daṇḍanīti* is neglected.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 26).—‘Ānvīkṣikī (Philosophy), Trayī (Three Vedas),
Vārtā (Trade-Agriculture) and Daṇḍanīti (Science of Government) are the
Sciences;—according to the Mānavas, the Three Vedas, Trade-Agriculture
and Science of Government—Philosophy being only a part of the Three
Vedas; according to the Bārhaspatyas, Trade-Agriculture and Science of
Government—the Three Vedas being only a cover for the man who knows the
worldly affairs; the Science of Government is the only Science, say the
followers of Uśanas—the progress of all Sciences being centred therein;
there are four Sciences, says Kauṭilya; it is by means of these that one
can understand the methods of acquiring wealth and spiritual merit; it
is this that constitutes the essence of the Sciences. Sāṅkhya, Yoga and
Lokāyata constitute ‘Philosophy’; Merit and Demerit are dealt with in
the Three Vedas; Profit and Loss are dealt with in the Science of
Trade-Agriculture; Policy, good and bad, is dealt with in the Science of
Government.’

*Śukranīti* (1.303).—‘Logic, Three Vedas, Trade-Agriculture, and Science
of Government,—these four branches of learning the king shall always
study.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.21-22).—‘Knowledge of Polity, wise judgment, contentment,
skilfulness,...... good conduct and restraint of the passions...... are
the sources of all prosperity.’

Though the subjugation of the senses has been already enjoined among the
‘Duties of Students’ as beneficial for all men, yet it is again
reiterated among the ‘Duties of Kings’ with a view to indicate that this
forms an important factor in their training.

This is what is meant by the words—‘he *whose senses are subjugated* &c.
&c.’ It is a fact well known to all men that one whose senses are not
subdued does not succeed in keeping his subjects under control.

‘*Effort*’—intense exertion.

‘*Day and night*’—Daring the day as well as during the night.—(44)

*Kāmandaka* (1.62).—‘The prosperity of a king who keeps his passion
under control and who follows the path chalked out by the Science of
Government always shines; his fame also reaches the heavens.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 37).—‘The control of the senses is at the root of
learning and discipline; this control should he acquired by the
abandonment of desires, anger, greed, pride, vanity and pleasure. The
control of the senses consists in avoiding the improper activities of
the Auditory, Tactile, Visual, Gustatory and Olfactory organs towards
their respective objects, sound, touch, colour, taste and odour; or it
may consist in making them act according to the scriptures; the whole
purpose of the scriptures lies in the control of the senses.’

*Śukranīti* (1.301).—‘Of the monarch who has conquered his senses and
who follows the Nītiśāstra, prosperity is in the ascendant and fame
reaches the skies.’

*Kāmandaka* (5.36).—‘A king, conversant with notions of justice and
injustice, having subdued his mind already powerless through the
subjugation of the senses, should exert himself for realising his own
good.’

This verse adds a further reason for subjugating the senses.

One whose senses are not subdued cannot avoid the vices. ‘*Durantāni*’,
‘*Ruinous*’,—whose end is painful. In the beginning vices bring a
certain amount of pleasure, but afterwards they lead to *ruin*; hence
they are called ‘ruinous’.

Or the term ‘*durantāni*’ may mean *whose end cannot be got at*; *i.e*.,
people caught in a vice cannot escape from it.

Those that have their source in ‘love of pleasure’ are
railed^(‘)*Kāmasamuttha*’—(45)

**(verses 7.45-53)  
**

*Kāmandaka* (1.54).—‘Hunting, gambling and drinking,—these are condemned
in a king. Behold the catastrophe that befell King Pāṇḍu, the king of
Niṣadha and the descendants of Vṛṣṇi, through indulgence in each of
these respectively. Lust, anger, avarice, fiendish delight in indicting
injury, morbid desire for honour, and arrogance—these six passions
should be avoided.’

Do. (1.65, 68).—‘A self-controlled king receives the highest homage.
Self-control is the ornament of kings. A self-controlled king appears as
beautiful as a gentle elephant shedding ichor. A powerful king without
practising self-control is subdued by his enemies without difficulty;
while a weak king practising self-control and observing the scriptural
injunctions never meets with defeat.’

Do. (11.12).—‘Women, intoxicating drinks, hunting, gambling and diverse
scourges of fate are called *vyasana*. One who is under the influence of
these *vyasanas* is the person against whom expedition should be
undertaken.’

Do. (14.65).—‘Beautiful women and drink may be enjoyed within the bounds
of moderation; but a learned king should never indulge in hunting and
gambling; for these are beset with graver dangers.’

*Śukranīti* (1.283).—‘Hunting, gambling and drinking are condemnable in
kings. Dangers from these are illustrated in the cases of Pāṇḍu, Nala
and Vṛṣṇi respectively... Sensuousness, anger, ignorance, cupidity, and
passion,—one should give up these. On giving up these the king becomes
happy.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.39).—‘A king, delighting in vile acts, and having eyes
blinded by sensuous objects, brings terrible catastrophe upon his own
head.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.50-52).—‘He should not take delight in hunting, dice, women
and drinking;—nor in defamation and assault; and he should not injure
his own property,’

*Śukranīti* (1.235).—‘Kings should not indulge in sensuousness with
regard to others’ wives, cupidity towards others’ wealth, and anger
towards his own subjects.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rāja, p. 146).—‘Hunting, drinking and
gambling, the king should avoid; kings addicted to these are ruined.
Sleeping during the day and purposeless roaming should be specially
avoided; he should not commit defamation or assault; the king shall also
avoid talking ill of people behind their back; he shall avoid the two
kinds of misuse of wealth, *viz*., misuse *of* wealth and misuse *by
means of* wealth; the misuse *of* wealth consists of the demolishing of
walls and the neglecting of forts, etc., and also of reckless
squandering; and misuse *by means of* wealth consists in making presents
at improper times and places and to improper persons. The king shall not
he very soft; as soft people are always ill-treated; nor shall he be
very hard; as people become disaffected with hard men; the king who is
soft at times and also hard at times, wins both worlds. The king shall
avoid joking with his dependants; dependants always ill-treat masters
given to jocular conversation. The king shall avoid all vices.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do., p. 149).—‘The king should not enter an unknown
crowd, or an unknown water, until it has been examined beforehand by
trustworthy persons; nor shall he ride on a wild elephant, or on an
untrained horse; he shall never visit an unknown woman, nor one in her
courses. He shall never enter an ill-constructed boat, nor one of which
the boats men have not been tested. He shall never disturb the
endowments made in favour of gods; nor any standing endowments. He shall
never confiscate the property of a Brāhmaṇa, which he shall always
respect.’

*Śukranīti* (1.215).—‘Indulgence in gambling, women and wine, when
undue, brings many disasters; within due limits, it brings wealth, sons
and intelligence.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya* (Parāśaramādhava-Ācāra, p. 414).—‘He shall renounce all
vices, specially the seven root ones. He shall protect himself against
enemies, by guarding his secrets from going out. The king shall keep
himself controlled by his position, prosperity, ruin, knowledge and the
six qualities; and never by desires. First of all he shall know himself,
then his ministers, then his dependants, and lastly all the citizens;
when this has been done, then alone shall he go against his enemies.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 39).—‘By subjugating the six-fold group of enemies he
shall acquire sense-control; by associating with elders, he shall
acquire wisdom; through the spy, he shall obtain vision; by action,
security of life and property; by controlling the activities of people,
he shall secure attention to the special functions of each man: by the
teaching of sciences, discipline; by the proper use of wealth,
prosperity, Having acquired sense-control, he shall shun others’ women,
others’ wealth and also injury to beings; also over-addiction to sleep,
fickleness, untruthfulness, too showy appearance, and misuse of wealth;
also all improper and illegal proceedings.’

Killing of animals for purposes of the chase is ‘*Hunting*’.

‘*Dice*’—Gambling with dice. That these two lead to evil consequences is
well known.

‘*Sleeping during the day*’.—*i.e*., not acting at the time at which a
certain action should be done. The term ‘*divā*’ here does not stand for
the *day* only; this same idea being expressed elsewhere by means of the
phrase ‘sleeping at the time of waking.’

Or, the term may betaken in its literal sense; sleeping during the day
is positively prohibited, and it stands in the way of all business. This
habit causes disappointment to men who want an interview with the king,
and also to others; and as such becomes, a source of discontent among
the people.

‘*Censoriousness*’—the criticising of other people’s faults in private.
This displeases all men. As for the blaming of persons who do not
deserve it, this is itself constitutes a sin.

‘*Women*’, ‘*intoxication*’—the fact of these two being evils is well
known. ‘*Musical triad* *i.e*., dancing, singing and instrumental music.

‘*Listless wandering*’—walking about hither and thither, other for no
purpose, or for a wicked purpose.

‘*Tenfold*’—which are ten in number.

‘*Arising from the love of pleasure*’, ‘*Kāma*—‘*Kama*’ is desire, from
which they arise;—or they arise from a particular kind of pleasure;—or
‘*Kāmya*’ may mean *arising from* *a* *particular experienced
object*.—(47).

It has been said that Greediness is at the root of the set of vices born
of love of pleasure; ‘love of pleasure’ consists in hankering after the
objects of enjoyment; and ‘hankering,’ ‘desire,’ ‘greediness’ are
synonymous.

“But how can greediness be the root of the set of vices arising from
Anger, on the basis of which it is said that *both these sets arise out
of that*?”

Our answer is as follows:—What is meant is not that the two sets of
vices have Greediness for their cause, but that Greediness is equal to
the two sets of vices;—the sense being that greediness alone by
itself—even when appearing in a man free from the vices,—produces all
those evils which all the said vices produce; to which end we have the
assertion—‘greediness -destroys all good qualities.’ It is in this sense
that we have the figurative assertion that ‘*both these sets arise out
of that*.’ If there were no Greediness, how could there appear results
similar to those of greediness? In fact, it is the defect in the cause
that indicates the defect in the effect; hence, if there is any evil in
the vices, appearing as the effects of greediness, it follows that there
is a like evil in the cause also.

Or, the meaning may be that as a rule it is only the greedy person who
becomes addicted to Tale-bearing and other shunable acts. Other persons,
even in small matters, become appeased even by slight entreaties. And it
is this that is spoken of figuratively by describing the two sets of
vices as arising out of greediness.—(49.)

Between Drinking and Gambling, Drinking is the more serious; because
this entails loss of consciousness; by it the unmaddened man becomes
maddened, the living man becomes dead, the man exposes his private
parts, loses his friends, is abandoned by good men and becomes
associated with bad persons; becomes addicted to singing and other
vices, shamelessly gives out bis love and other secrets; the respected
man becomes an object of obloquy, even the otherwise serious man becomes
liable to talk at random, when suffering from intoxication. Such are the
evil effects of Drinking. In the case of Gambling on the other hand, the
man who knows the art of gambling always wins, and also for one who does
not know the art there is only partial loss.

Between Woman and Gambling, the vice of Gambling is more serious. In
Gambling what is won by the man becomes poison for himself; winning
always gives rise to enmities, since it is only loss that is common to
several people; it also leads to the loss of what may have been already
enjoyed; then again, on account of the checking of the calls of nature,
the body becomes dull and a breeding-ground of disease; so that even
Blight causes become productive of much pain; (such is the spirit of
gambling that) even at the death of his mother the man keeps on his
gambling; even when he has attained success, he cannot be drawn away
from it even by bis well-wishers; he ceases to trust even such persons
as avoid other people’s belongings like heated iron; he neglects to give
food and other things to persons that are hungry and in straitened
circumstances; even though endowed with all estimable qualities, he
comes to be despised, as a blade of grass. Such are the evils of
gambling. In the vice connected with woman on the other hand, there is
this good that the man obtains children, enjoys excellent dinners and
nice articles of toilet; so that he secures wealth as well as some
virtue. Further, it is possible to employ women on state-business, and
also for the purpose of rendering people open to stigma and censure.

Between Woman and Hunting, the vice in connection with women is more
serious. Under its influence, the King neglects his business; becoming
addicted to women, he acquires distaste for state-business, he wastes
time and loses in virtue, becomes addicted to the evils of drinking as
also to lying and other pernicious habits. In Hunting on the other hand,
there is physical exercise, a lessening of the humours of bile and
phlegm, reduction of obesity, markmanship in ariming (aiming?) at moving
as well as standing targets, also practice of hitting; the king also
aquires a degree of alertness and cultivates the acquaintance of the
village-folk.

Thus in the set of four vices proceeding from love of pleasure, that
which precedes is more abominable than that which follows.

In the set born of anger also, assaulting is beset with evils, and is
followed by addiction to lying and other evil habits. Between Assaulting
and Cruelty of speech, Assaulting is more serious. In the case of
assault, making up becomes impossible, while in the case of cruel speech
the fire of auger and hatred is capable of being appeased by the
subsequent bestowals of gifts and honour.

Between cruel speech and misappropriation of property, cruel speech is
the more serious. Even high-minded persons become afflicted and
perturbed in mind by cruel speech. To this effect we have the following
saying:—

‘Even a powerful sword, or a black dart, entering the bone may make the
body free from pain, when removed, but words never disappear from the
heart; that which is pierced by an arrow grows again; the forest cut off
by the axe again flourishes; but that which is wounded by rough and
indecent speech never flourishes again’.

Misappropriation of property on the other hand is looked upon as an
effect of ill-luck and as such high-minded people donot feel keenly
about it.

Thus it is shown that in these two sets the preceding vice is more
serious than the succeeding one.—(52)

Though both death and vice deprive one of every thing, yet there is this
difference between them that death deprives one of everything, only in
this world, while vice deprives him of all things in this world as well
as in heaven.

‘*The vicious man sinks down and down*’—falls into hell.

The term ‘*vicious*’ denotes excessive addiction to the aforesaid sets
of vices. Hence it is such repeated addiction that is forbidden; not
merely having recourse to them once in a way.

These vices become destructive of virtue, wealth, pleasure and life,
even in the case of ordinary men; what to say of Kings? At the same time
it would not be right to\] abandon drinking etc. entirely; nor would it
be possible; hence it is the habit that is forbidden.—(53)

‘down below’).

‘*Of respectable status*’;—hereditary servants of the king, possessed of
many children, and relations and much wealth, openly possessing vast
numbers of cattle and landed property, inhabitants of the kingdom.
‘*Mūla*’ is *status*; and those possessed of status are ‘*maula*’.

‘*Versed in law*’;—‘*śāstra*’ is *law, ordinance*; the law regulating
the conduct of servants; hence the term indicates other qualifications
also; such as—intelligent, of firm resolve, capable of much hard labour,
clever, eloquent, strong, respectable, endowed with courage and energy,
able to bear hardships, pure, liberal, equipped with estimable
character, free from both tardiness and fickleness, loved by men, not
prone to making enemies.

The term ‘*śūra*’, ‘*of heroic temperament*’, indicates one who, in his
zeal for the king’s work, takes no account of his body, life, children
or wealth, and also also not afraid of death, ever ready for battle, and
though alone, he is ever ready to engage in a fight with many
persons,—capable of striking hard, possessed of strength.

‘*Experienced in business*’;—this indicates the fact of their having
seen much work; those who have actually fought with the sword, who have
successfully accomplished their duties, who have had previous experience
in ministerial work.

‘*Born of noble families*;’—when people are moved by considerations of
their noble family, they desist from improper acts.

‘*Ministers*’— assistants.

These should always remain at the king’s side.

‘*Seven or eight*’—This is a restrictive rule; fewer than these are
likely to combine,—and this would render the king’s consultations
one-sided. On the other hand, if they are too many, there is likely to
be great diversities of opinion. Hence only seven or eight ministers are
to be appointed.

‘*Thoroughly tested*”—This refers to tests relative to (*a*) virtue,
(*b*) wealth, (*c*) love and (*d*) fear. For instance, (*a*) The Priest,
under the pretext of having been reprimanded in his work, by the king,
should approach each of the ministers with large presents sent through
trustworthy messengers, with proposals purporting to bring about the
king’s ruin, saying—‘this proposal has been approved by all the
ministers, how does it appear to you?’—If the minister thus approached,
repudiates the suggestion, he has been ‘tested with the test of
virtue.’—(*b*) The army—commander, under a similar pretext of having
been reprimanded, may approach one of the ministers with large presents
sent through trusted messengers, suggesting proposals for bringing about
the king’s ruin, saying—‘this has been approved by all ministers, what
do you think of it?’—If the minister should repudiate the suggestion, he
becomes ‘tested with the test of wealth.’ (*c*) A female ascetic who is
trusted in the king’s harem, shall approach each of the ministers,
saying—‘such and such a queen is in love with you and has made
arrangements for meeting you.’ If the man repudiates the suggestion, he
becomes ‘tested with the test of love.’—(*d*) Some persons, urged by the
king himself, should give out the rumour that ‘the king is being killed
by certain ministers who have made a combination against him’; having
heard this numour (rumour?), a trusted man in the priest’s employ should
suggest to the ministers the following plan—‘on hearing this rumour the
king is going to punish you’; one of these men, having previously
entered into the plan, should approach each of the ministers and urge
them to activity; the ministers who repudiate this suggestion become
‘tested with the test of fear.’

Or, he shall appoint such ministers of finance as are ‘*maula*’ *i.e*.,
capable of collecting and guarding and rightly spending wealth; that is,
those who collect wealth from the villages, and carefully keep and
rightly spend what has been collected. The meaning thus is that he shall
appoint such finance ministers as are experts in money-matters.—‘*Versed
in lavs*’— the councillors that he appoints should be learned.—The
army-commanders that he appoints should be ‘*of heroic temperament*.’
‘*Experienced*’ and the other epithets qualify each of those mentioned
above.

Some people hold that the ‘testing’ of ministers, in the manner related
above, is not the right thing to do; they hold that such testing may
actually produce unfaithful feelings in the minds of the ministers.
Hence some other faithful woman (than the queen herself) should be
employed (in the test); and the intrigue too should he proposed against
some other person than the King himself.—(54)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Labdhalakṣān*’—‘Experienced’ (Medhātithi);—‘who fail not in their
undertakings’ (Govindarāja, Nandana and Rāghavānanda);—‘skilled in the
use of weapons.’

‘*Suparīkṣitān*’—‘Tried through temptations’ (Medhātithi);—‘tried as to
incorruptibiliy’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘tested by spies’ (Govindarāja);—‘bound to
fidelity by oath, by touching the images of gods and such sacred objects
(Kullūka and Rāghavānandà).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.311) to the effect that the
king should appoint seven or eight councillors;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra p. 405);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 177), which explains,
‘*labdhalakṣān*’ as ‘*paridṛṣtakarmaṇaḥ*’, ‘who have seen action’,
*i.e*., ‘experienced’;—in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 61), which explains
‘*labdhalakṣān*’ as ‘clever’,—‘*maulān*’ as ‘hereditary’;—and in
*Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 9b).

**(verses 7.54-55)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (3.71).—‘He shall appoint ministers to help him in his affairs,
who are pure, free from covetousness, attentive and able.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.310-311),—‘He shall appoint ministers who are
intelligent, hereditarily connected, firm and pure; with these he shall
take counsel; as also with the Brāhmaṇa.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 175).—‘He shall appoint such
assistants for himself as are brave, of noble family, strong, endowed
with wealth, beauty, nobility and other good qualities, self-controlled,
endowed with forgiveness, capable of hard work, courageous, knowing the
duty, of sweet speech,

capable of offering salutary advice and devoted to their master.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 175).—‘The attendants of
the king shall he gentle, high-born, brave, equipped with knowledge,
free from jealousy, not mean, pure and clever.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do.).—‘The king should appoint only such ministers as are
able and have been duly tested.’

Do. (*Rājadharma*) (Do., p. 177).—‘The king shall honour that minister
who is grateful, intelligent, free from meanness, firmly devoted to him,
firm in his duty and firmly grounded in political science.’

*Parāśara* (Do., p. 178).—‘The king shall appoint as ministers,
counsellors, ambassadors, priests, judge and members of the
assembly,—such people as may he devoted to his welfare and safety.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—The king shall appoint as his minister a Brāhmaṇa,
noble-born and devoted to the king, expert in his business.’

*Śukranīti* (2.106-109).—‘The king shall examine his officers with
reference to their work, companionship, merit, habits, family-relations
and other things; and place confidence in those that are found
trustworthy.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 174).—‘Immediately after his
anointment, the king shall proceed to select his assistants; even an
undertaking that is easy is difficult to he accomplished by a single
man, especially when one who has no assistant; how much more is the work
of the king which involves great issues! Therefore the king shall
himself select assistants born of noble families.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 41).—‘He shall appoint as ministers such persons as
have been his fellow-students; as he is cognisant of the purity of their
character, and hence has trust in them; so says Bharadvāja. This is
denied by Viśālākṣa, who holds that as these men have sported with him,
they are likely to disregard him; hence as ministers he should appoint
such men as share his secrets; because such men have the same habits and
defects as himself; as these men knowing that the king knows their
secrets will never misbehave towards him. Parāśara holds that this
objection is common to both; the king also knowing that they know his
secrets, will follow them in their acts of commission and omission;
hence he should appoint as ministers such persons as might have helped
him in dangerous situations; because their attachment to him has been
actually seen. Piśuna denies this; the feeling here mentioned is an
emotion, it is not a lasting quality of the mind; hence the king should
appoint as ministers such persons as have, in actual practice, been
found to have acted in strict accordance with orders; because the
quality of these will have been actually perceived. This again is denied
by Kauṇapadanta; because even these men would not be endowed with other
qualities necessary in ministers; therefore he shall appoint as
ministers such persons as have been hereditary ministers, because the
antecedents of such men are fully known; they will not abandon him even
though ill-treated, because of the hereditary relationship. This is
denied by Vātavyādhi, on the ground that such men would arrogate to
themselves all the powers of the master and would behave as such;
therefore be shall appoint as ministers such persons as are well-versed
in political science and are strangers; strangers would regard the king
as holding the rod of chastisement and would never misbehave. This is
denied by Bāhudantī-putra, on the ground that a man, though possessing
theoretical knowledge, if devoid of practical experience, would come to
grief; hence he should appoint as ministers such persons as are endowed
with the qualities of nobility of birth, wisdom, purity, bravery and
loyalty. All these opinions are right, says Kauṭilya; but the real
character of men can he ascertained only from actual experience; hence
the king shall examine the ministerial capacity of the persons
concerned, the exigencies of time and place, and also the nature of the
work in hand and then appoint them as *ministers*, not as the *chief
minister*.’

*Kāmandaka* (4.27-30).—‘*Upadhās* are the means of testing honesty, and
by these the king should test his dependants. A person who has got a
good many friends to deter him from the paths of vice, who is not a
foreigner by birth, who possesses noble lineage and character and great
physical strength, who is eloquent and audacious in speech and is
farsighted, energetic and ready-witted, who is free from obstinacy and
fickleness and is faithful to his friends, who is painstaking and pure
and truthful, who is blessed with equanimity, cheerfulness, patience,
gravity and health, who is a master of all the arts, dexterous, prudent
and retentive, unswerving in his devotion, and not prone to avenge the
wrongs done to him by his sovereign,—such a person should be selected as
the minister. Accuracy of memory, exclusive devotion to the ways and
means and the Empire, grave consideration of the *pros* and *cons* of a
question, unerring judgment, firmness, and observance of secrecy
regarding all counsels,—these are the necessary qualifications of a
minister.’

Do. (11.61).—‘A mantra or counsel consists of five parts: supports,
means to ends, divisions of time and place, averting of calamities and
final success.’

Do. (11.74).—‘Manu says twelve, Bṛhaspati says sixteen, and Uśanas says
twenty, ministers should form a cabinet.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 48).—‘Accompanied by the Chief Minister and the
Domestic Priest, he shall, in the first instance, appoint ministers to
unimportant posts, and there test them by means of tests.’

Do. (p. 76).—‘The cabinet of ministers shall consist of twelve—say the
followers of Manu; sixteen, say the followers of Bṛhaspati; twenty, say
the followers of Uśanas; the number shall depend on the king’s own
capacity, says Kauṭilya.’

The ordinary household work of the householder,—such as looking after
cattle, house and the rest—has been regarded as ‘easy’; the same man
tends the cattle and milks the cow. But even so all this cannot be clone
by a single man; it is still more difficult if the man happens to have
no one to assist him; how can he take the cattle to graze, and at the
same time look after his wife? As for ‘*the work of the king*’, it is an
important undertaking and leads to important results; its proper
accomplishment bears important fruits, and important results accrue to
the man who fulfills it. But a single man cannot be expected to know all
the six ‘means of success’. Hence it it necessary for the king to
appoint to the several departments of state trusted assistants, who are
possessed of qualifications similar to those of the king himself.—(55)

With the aforesaid councillors and finance-ministers he shall discuss
the ‘*ordinary business*’— what may not be of a very confidential
nature—‘*relating to peace and war*’; he shall consider *peace and war*;
he shall consider the pros and cons of both sides of the question as to
whether on a certain occasion peace or war would be the right course to
adopt. But the actual decision he should take himself; so that he may
not appear to have been guided by other persons.

He should also discuss the ‘*state*’; this is fourfold, consisting of
Army, Treasure, City and Kingdom. Of these the ‘*Army*’ consists in
Elephants, Horses, Chariots and Footsoldiers; and he shall discuss such
things relating to them as maintenance, protection, and the appointment
of proper commanders as regards the *Treasury*, it should abound in gold
and silver in large quantities, which should not be spent; the cardinal
parts of the Treasury shall never be expended; nor should payments to
servants be delayed;—as regards the *Kingdom*, which is the same as
*country*, it should be maintained intact against encroachment by
others, by the careful looking after of rivers and trees and cattle, the
building of protective works against possible attacks by enemies; it
should not be allowed to depend entirely on rain, and in times of
distress special penalties and taxes shall be levied (?);—as regards the
*City*, the methods of guarding it are going to be described under 7.75.

Or, ‘*sthāna*’, ‘*state*’, may mean not deviating from its own position.

Similarly he shall also discuss the ‘*sources of revenue*’—such as
agriculture, pastures, barriers, trade, fines and so forth.

‘*Means of protection*’,— of the king’s own kingdom, as going to be
described later on.

‘*Consolidation of what has been acquired*’;—the honouring of learned
and pious men and the continuance of bounties to them, the granting of
fresh bounties; and the removal of all restraints; merciful treatment of
the poor and the diseased; the instituting of fresh public sports and
rejoicings and the continnance (continuance?) of those already in vogue.
He shall put a stop to all abuses regarding the Treasury and judicial
procedure, and introduce sounder methods of work. If there is some
improper act done by others he shall stop it; but he shall not interfere
with any righteons (righteous?) act that may be done by others.

In this manner ‘*State*’ and the rest shall be discussed.—(56).

‘*Sthānam*’—‘Halting’ (Nandana).—Buhler misrepresents Medhātithi when he
attributes to him the alternative explanation of *sthāna* as ‘loss of
his Kingdom’, in reality Medhātithi says ‘stability of the Kingdom’ as
rightly understood by Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Virāmitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 316), which adds
the following notes:—*Taiḥ*, ‘with the said councillors,—*chintayet*,
‘the. King should deliberate,’—*sandhiḥ*, ‘alliances’—*vigrahaḥ*,
‘declaration of war’,—*sthānam*, ‘consisting of the four factors of the
army, treasury, capital city and Kingdom’,—‘*samudayaḥ*,’ ‘agriculture,
pastures, outposts, traders, cattle, customs, fines and so
forth,’—*guptiḥ*, protection of his Kingdom,—*labdhapraśamanam*,
‘bestowing of honours and gifts upon temples, hermitages and learned
men’;—the meaning of the phrase *sāmānyam sandhivigraham* is that he
should discuss questions of peace and war in general, the detailed and
specific details being discussed in connection with the ‘*ṣāḍguṇya*.’

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 405) and in
*Rājanītiratnākara*;—(p. 10b).

*Yājñavalkya* (1-311).—‘With the ministers the king shall take counsel;
specially with the Brāhmaṇa.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 45).—‘The following are the qualities of the Chief
Minister: He should have been born and bred in the kingdom, of noble
birth, having a large family, versed in the arts, with keen powers of
perception, intelligent, possessed of a retentive memory, clever,
eloquent, bold, quick-witted, endowed with courage and influence,
capable of hard work, pure, sympathetic, firmly loyal, equipped with
character, strength, health and patience, devoid of haughtiness and
fickleness, of prepossessing appearance and never likely to create
enmities. The king shall therefore examine the land of birth and family
of the candidates for Chief Ministership; the exact amount of their
knowledge of arts and sciences he shall find out from other persons
learned in the same; their intelligence, memory and cleverness he shall
find out from actual experience; eloquence he shall find out from his
conversations; as also lowness and quickness of wit; courage and
influence shall be found out in times of trouble; purity, sympathy and
loyalty from actual experience; character, strength, health and patience
from their neighbours; and prepossessing appearance from direct
perception.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 71).—‘All operations should be preceded by due
discussion among Ministers.’

*Kāmandaka* (13.23).—‘The functions of the *Prakritimaṇḍala* are the
following:—To hold counsels, to secure the results of counsels, to
direct others to perform their functions, to ascertain the effects of
coming events, to look after income and expenditure, to administer
justice, to subjugate enemies, to avert threatening evils and
calamities, to protect the kingdom,—those are the functions of the
minister. But the minister who is subject to the *vyasanas* fails in all
this.’

‘*Arthe*’, ‘*work relating to finance*’,—*i.e*., offices prataining
(pertaining?) to income and expenditure. In these he shall employ those
who are ‘*honest*’—not covetous of wealth.

Some of these financial offices are indicated by example ‘*mines and
stores*’;—‘*mines*’ are places where gold, silver and other precious
metals are dug out and cleansed, and ‘*stores*’ consist of food-grains,
cotton, seeds and so forth.

‘*In the inferior of the palace*’;—*i.e*., the inner apartments, the
kitchen, the bed-room and the ladies’ apartments.—In these he shall
appoint ‘*timid*’ persons. Because brave persons, if won over by his
enemies, might kill the king, when he may be alone.

All of these should be ‘*expert*’; they are energetic and, not minding
any opposition, never allow their master’s work to suffer.—(62)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Karmānta*’—‘*Bhakṣya-kārpāsāvāpādayaḥ*’, ‘Food stuffs, cotton fabrics,
utensils and so forth’ or ‘sowing of seeds of food-grains and cotton
etc.’ (Medhātithi, to whom Buhler, on the strength of his own Mss.,
attributes the explanation ‘sugar-mills, distilleries and so
forth’);—‘store-houses of sugarcane, grains and such things’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 187), which adds
the following notes:—*Teṣām*, ‘from among the said
assistants’;—‘*arthe*,’ ‘in the work of collecting revenue’; which is
further explained by the term ‘*ūkarakarmānta*’;—‘*bhīrūn*’, ‘those who
are full of fear of this world as well as of the next’

It is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 581);—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 53),
which explains ‘*ākara*’ as ‘mines of gold and other
metals’,—‘*karmānta*’ as ‘*granaries*’,—and ‘*antarniveśana*’ as ‘the
bed-room and other private apartments,’ and adds that there should be
‘*bhīru*’, cowards, as brave men might kill the king.

For the Ambassador the further qualification is necessary,—that he
should be able to understand ‘*hints, expressions and gestures*’. When
the Ambassador goes to another king and the latter is deliberating with
his ministers on questions of peace, there pass among them certain
signs; for instance, the Ambassador is received with studied regard, he
is confided in, his entire speeches are frequently praised. \[All these
he shall take note of.\] But of unfavourable signs he shall take no
notice.

‘*Expressions*’—bodily changes; such as dejected looks, paleness of the
face, silence, heaving of sighs, long and hot;—such bodily changes
indicate humility, and the clever ambassador infers from these that ‘the
man has fallen in some dire calamity, that is why he is pale’. On the
other hand, when the man talks glibly, his body wears a bloom, the face
is happy,—it shows that he is pleased.

‘*Honest*’—in his dealings with women; (this is necessary) since it is
through women that secrets generally become divulged and men fall into
disgrace.—(63)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 188), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Sarvaśāstraviśāradam*’, ‘expert in several
sciences, scriptural as well as temporal’;—‘*iṅgitam*’, ‘words and
accents indicative of people’s intentions’,—‘*ākāraḥ*’, ‘joyous or pale
expression of the face, indicative of joy or grief’;—‘*ceṣṭā*’, ‘such
actions as the throwing about of the arms and so forth, which are
indicative of anger and other emotions’;—the man appointed should know
all these.

This verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 225);—and in
*Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 28b).

**(verses 7.63-64)  
**

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 180).—‘The ambassador should
he one who is truthful, conversant with dialects, eloquent, capable of
endurance, sweet of speech, possesses knowledge of countries and their
divisions, as also of time and its divisions; he should be one who
acquaints himself with places and things and reports what he knows to
the king at the right time.’

*Garuḍa-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 180).—‘Intelligent,
thoughtful, capable of gauging.the minds of others, hard-hearted,
truthful,—such should be the ambassador of the king.’

*Mahābhārata* (Vīramitrodaya-Lakṣaṇa, p. 226).—‘High-born, polite,
eloquent, clever, sweet of speech, truthful, of bright complexion,—these
seven qualities should mark out the ambassador.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Lakṣaṇa, p. 226).—(Same as the
Matsya-purāṇa above.)

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 78).—‘After having completed the consultation, he
shall send out ambassadors. The ambassador should be endowed with all
the qualities of the minister, if the entire business is to be confided
to him; and if he is possessed of only three quarters of these
qualities, only a part of the business shall be confided to him; and if
he is possessed of only half of those qualities, then he shall only
carry orders (without knowledge of the secrets).’

*Kāmandaka* (12.1).—‘Having previously held the necessary counsel, the
wise king shall depute to the court of the monarch against whom he
intends to march, an ambassador, confident of his special abilities,—his
selection having been approved by the cabinet.’

‘*Upon the minister*’—*i.e*., on the commander—‘*is* *dependent the
army*’—composed of the elephant and the rest; since it is according to
his wishes that it operates.

‘*On the army rests the act of ruling*’;—since the person, be he an
inhabitant of the king’s own realm, or of another kingdom, who is to be
‘*ruled*’ has got to be punished; and the act pertaining thereto is
called the ‘act of ruling’.

‘*The Treasury and the Realm are dependent upon the king*’—‘*Treasury*’
is the place of accumulation; and ‘*realm*’ is the country; and these
two should not be made over to the charge of any other person; the king
should look after them himself.

‘*Upon the ambassador depend peace and its opposite*’—‘Peace’ is
obtained by the use of agreeable word and showing off what is done by
his master; the opposite of this leads to ‘war’; both of these thus are
dependent upon the Ambassador.—(65)

The Ambassador brings about the alliance of kings, and also disunites
those already allied. He does the former by saying even such agreeable
things as he has not been commissioned to say; and the latter by
describing even such unfriendly acts as may not have been done; by not
paying the presents of gold and other things that he may have brought
with him.

In this way be disunites allies.

This business, just spoken of, is transacted by the Ambassador, and by
it kings become disunited.

It is only persons with disagreeable speech that do this—(66)

**(verse 7.67)**

‘*Niguḍheṅgitaceṣṭitaiḥ*’—‘By his own hidden gestures and actions’
(Govindarāja);—‘through the gestures and actions of the Confidential
agents of the other party’ (Kullūka); — ‘through men who hide their own
significant gestures and actions’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 188).

**(verse 7.68)**

The *Bhāṣya* on this verse has not been seen by us.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 188).

According to Medhātithi (mentioned by Buhler), the verse refers to the
*Ambassador* who should so act as not to bring evil upon his own party;
while according to others it refers to the *king*. Kullūka leaves it
doubtful.

**(verse 7.69)**

‘*Jāṅgalam*’—“The full definition of *Jāṅgala* is, according to a verse
quoted by Govindarāja, Rāghavānanda and Kullūka, as below—‘That country
is called *Jāṅgala* which has little water and grass, where strong
breezes prevail, the heat is great, where rain and the like are
abundant”—Buhler.

‘*Anāvilam*’—‘Where the people are not quarrelsome’ (Medhātithi,
mentioned by Buhler; though the Bhāṣya on this verse also is not found
in any of the printed editions, nor in any of the Mss. consulted by
us);—‘not subject to epidemic diseases’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 197), which quotes
the defintion of ‘*Jāṅgala*’ noted above, and adds that the
qualification that ‘water should be scarce’ is meant to indicate that
such a place would be less likely to be attacked by the enemy; in the
capital itself the supply of water should be abundant. It adds the
following explanatory notes on the text:—The place should be fully
supplied with ‘*shasya*’, *i*. *e*., with rich and fresh supplies of
grains from the autumn, winter, spring and rain harvests;—it should be
‘*āryaprāyam*’, *i.e*., full of virtuous people;—‘*anāvila*’, *i.e*.,
free from all dangers from serpents, tigers and the like,—‘*ramya*,’
agreeable, pleasant,—‘*ānatasāman* *ta*’, ‘having all subsidiary kings
fully won over by gifts of presents and honors’,—and ‘*svājīvya*’,
‘where means of agriculture and trade are easily procurable’;—in
‘*deśamāvaset*,’ the accusative ending is due to the root ‘*vas*’ being
preceded by the preposition ‘*ā*.’

**(verse 7.69)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (3.4-5).—‘The king shall fix his abode in a district containing
open plains, fit for cattle and abounding in grain;—and inhabited by
many Vaiśyas and Śūdras.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.320).—‘He shall reside in a country which is open,
pleasant, fit for cattle, and where living is easily found.’

*Smṛtyantarā* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 197).—‘That country is called
*Jāṅgala* where there are a few trees and a little *water*, many birds
and many animals, and abundant heat and rain.’

*Kāmandaka* (4.54-56).—‘A country where living is cheap, soil fertile
and copiously irrigated, which is situated at the foot of a hill,
contains a large number of *Śūdras*, traders and artisans, where the
farmers are enterprising and energetic,

which is loyal to its ruler and inhospitable to its enemies, which
ungrudgingly bears taxation, extensive in area, crowded with foreigners,
which is rich, pious and abounding in cattle, where the popular leaders
are not foolish and voluptuous,—such a country is the best. The king
should always endeavour to promote the welfare of such a land; for with
its prosperity, the other constituents of the state also prosper.’

*Kāmandaka* (4.61).—‘A country having communications both by land and by
water, and furnished with castles affording shelter to the royal family
at the time of seige—such a country is suitable for the habitation of a
king seeking prosperity.’

*Śukraniti* (1.425-428).—‘In a place that abounds in trees, plants and
shrubs,—that is rich in cattle, birds and other animals,—that is
equipped with a good supply of water and grains and is happily provided
with resources in grass and fuel,—that is bestirred by the movements of
boats to the seas, and is not very far from the hills, and is on level
ground, a picturesque plain,—the king shall build his capital.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Do., p. 198).—‘The king having appointed his
assistants, shall take up his residence in a country which is supplied
with abundant fodder and fuel, pleasant, where the vassals are obedient,
and which is centrally situated; where the population consists largely
of Vaiśyas and Śūdras, nor liable to attack by enemies, containing a few
Brāhmaṇas and many labourers; which is not dependent totally upon rain,
inhabited by men devoted to the king, not over-taxed, and supplied with
plenty of fruits and flowers; nor accessible to the armies of others,
where happiness and unhappiness are equable; which is free from
reptiles, wild animals and thieves;—as far as possible, the king shall
take up his residence in such a country.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do.).—‘The king, along with his assistants, shall
take up his residence in a country which is suitable for cattle, open,
pleasant, inhabited principally by Vaiśyas and Śūdras, free from
diseases.’

*Arthaśāstra* (8.109).—‘Either an old settlement or a new one he shall
get inhabited either by importing men from other countries or by
overflowings from his own country; the village shall be inhabited mostly
by Śūdras and cultivators; consisting of not less than a hundred and not
more than five hundred families, with boundaries extending over two or
four miles and well marked by trees, hills, etc.’

‘*Bow-fort*’— surrounded by a strongly-built wall, built of bricks,
double-storeyed, more than 12 cubits high) with its base like the palm
and its top like the monkey’s head.

‘*Earthen fort*’— surrounded by earthen embankments.

‘*Aquatic fort*’—surrounded by unfathomable water.

‘*Arborial fort*’— surrounded, to a distance of four miles, with
densely-packed large trees.

‘*Human fort*’— garrisoned by an army of four divisions, and filled with
arms and heroic persons.

‘*Hilly fort*’— inaccessibly high, with a single pathway leading to it,
supplied with water from an underground stream.—(70)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 406), as describing
the various kinds of fortification;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1. 320) as
describing the six kinds of fortification;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti,
p. 202);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣana, p. 239), which adds the
following explanations:—‘*Dhanvadurgam*’ is ‘the fortification in the
midst of a desert’, called ‘*durga*’, because of its inaccessibility due
to absence of water and other difficulties;—it suggests another
explanation of the name—‘*dhanvā*’ is the name of a tract of land devoid
of shelter and water; and a fort that is surrounded by such a tract of
land is ‘*dhanvadurga*’; the meaning being that the king should make his
fort, and then render its vicinity waterless and shelterless. It notes a
third explanation of the name:—‘*Dhanvan*,’ ‘bow,’ indicates the
‘*dhanvin*’, ‘archer’; hence ‘*dhanvadurga*’ would mean a ‘line of
defence consisting of of men armed with bows and arrows This, it says,
is not right; as it involves the necessity of having recourse to
metaphorical explanation; and also because we have never heard of such a
‘fort’; again because such a ‘line of defence’ could be very easily
broken through; and lastly because this would be the same as the
‘*nṛdurga*’ coming later.—‘*Naradurga*’ is the line of defence
consisting of the army; and this consists of elephants, chariots, horses
and archers; and as this also would include archers, the separate name
‘*dhanvadurga*’ could not stand for the same sort of defence.—The
‘*Mahīdurga*’ is the ‘fort made of bricks and stones on the
ground’;—some people explain it as a fort consisting only of an unevenly
rugged tract of land;—the ‘Mahīdurga’ has been thus defined in *Auśanasa
Dhanurveda*—‘That fort is called *Mahīdurga* which consists of a tract
of land, portions of which are very high and others very low; it is
equipped with all accessories, well guarded and filled with all means of
offence and defence’. The ‘*Jaladurga*’ consists of that place which is
surrounded by swift, and unfordable streams of water.—The ‘*Vanadurga*’
is a tract of land surrounded by impenetrable forests and
trees.—‘*Baladurga* or *Nṛdurga*’ is that line of defence which consists
in the dispositions of the army.—The ‘*Giridurga*’ is erected either on
the summit of a mountain, or in a tract of land surrounded by hills.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 72a):—and in
*Nītimayūkha* (p. 64), which adds that Kāmandaka mentions the
*Airaṇadurga* also.

*Mahābhārata* (12.86.5).—‘Dhanvadurga, Mahīdurga, Giridurga,
Manuṣyadurga, Mṛddurga, Vanadurga,—these are the six forts.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.6).—‘There shall he reside in a stronghold—either of desert,
or of armed men, or of fortifications, or of water, or of trees, or of
mountains.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.20).—‘There he shall build forts for the protection of
men and treasures.’

*Kāmandaka* (4.57).—‘The king should settle in a fortress which is
extensive, environed by a wide ditch and secured with gates,
strengthened with high massive walls and sheltered by mighty mountains,
forests and deserts.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 199).—‘The wise king shall
build one of the six kinds of fort—the Bow fort, the Earthen fort, the
Human fort, the Arborial fort, the Aquatic fort and the Hilly fort.’

*Auśanasa Dhanurveda* (Do.).—‘(1) The *Bow fort* is that which is devoid
of water, abounding in pebbles, rough, without supports, beset with
obstacles and poisonous insects, not admitting of easy locomotion,
equipped with strong guards and free from disease. (2) The *Earthen
fort* is equipped with all accessories, well protected, and supplied
with implements, in places very high, and in places very low. (3) The
*Human fort* consists of men related to the king hereditarily, obedient
and contented, well-trained and under suitable officers, terrible, and
ever alert. (4) The *Arborial fort* consists of the forest, with paths
unknown, densely packed with trees, thickets and creepers and thorns
extending far and wide. (5) The *Aquatic fort* consists of water which
has only one entrance and that narrow, full of poison and such aquatic
animals as are fond of touching, devouring and killing. (6) *Hilly fort*
consists of a mountain, which is inaccessible, beyond the reach of
arrows, fully equipped with all accessories and comforts.’

*Mahābhārata* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 199).—‘The king shall gather
for himself all the corn; what he cannot gather, that he shall burn; all
standing crops also he shall destroy; he shall demolish all passages in
rivers and over forts; he shall make all the water flow out; what cannot
flow out, that he shall pollute; he shall uproot all small trees near
about the fort; of the larger trees, he shall lop off all the branches.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘For the protection of his wife, wealth and people,
as also of stores, the king has to build a fort with double walls.’

*Matsya-purāṇa*. (Do., p. 203).—‘The fort shall be surrounded by a
ditch, equipped with walls and towers, as also with hundreds of guns and
other machines.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do., Lakṣaṇa, p. 242).—‘The king shall build one of
the six kinds of forts.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 119).—‘In the middle of the settlement, he shall
establish a natural fort for purposes of war either in the form of an
enclosed island, or high ground surrounded by deep ditches, called the
water fort; or of stone, in the shape of caves, called the *hilly fort*;
caves, or barren ground devoid of water and grass, called the *Bow
fort*; Or of thicket-covered marshy land, called the *Arborial fort*. Of
these the Water and Hill forts are for defence and the Bow and Arborial
forts are for safety during times of distress.’

man takes shelter under men, who constitute his ‘fort’,—and the gods

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 203).—‘Of all forts, the
*Hilly fort* is the most highly commended.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do., p. 201).—‘Among the six kinds of forts laid down in
the scriptures, it is the *Human fort* that is the most inaccessible.’

*Śukranīti* (1.766).—‘The king should take shelter in hill forts in
times of great danger.’

Do. (4. 5, 2 *et seq*.).—‘Forts are made inaccessible by ditches,
thorns, rocks and deserts. The fort surrounded by ditches is called
*Parikhā*; that by walls of stone and bricks, *Parigha*; that by trees,
thorns and thickets *Vanadurga*; that near which there is no water is
called *Dhanvadurga*; that surrounded by large sheets of water is called
*Jaladurga*; that situated on high ground and supplied with plenty of
water is called *Giridurga*; that guarded by heroes versed in military
tactics is called *Sainyadurga*; that belonging to allies and relations
is the *Sahāyadurga*. The Sahāyadurga and the Sainyadurga arc the best

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 204).—‘It should be equipped
with fuel, flavouring substances, canes, fodder, conveyances, machines
and weapons, and also well-disposed and brave soldiers. The king shall
also bring together, and provide livings for Brāhmaṇas learned in Vedic
lore and Kṣatriyas, also performers of Agṇihotra.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do.).—‘Each one of these forts shall be supplied
with treasure and provisions, with elephants, horses and chariots,—also
with gems; it shall he fully supplied with machines, abounding in Vedic
learning, and equipped with all materials of war, well-stored with food
and money, supplied with drinks and water, fully supplied with
elephants, horses, chariots, cows, physicians and astrologers; also with

number (in ‘*purohitam*’, ‘priest’) should be regarded as significant;
specially as the singleness of the household priest has been declared
elsewhere also; the present construction being analogous to that in the
case of such sentences as ‘he cuts *a post*’, ‘one should obtain *a
wife*’, and so forth.

‘*He* *shall select officiating priests*’—The exact number of these
should be ascertained from Vedic texts. Their qualifications arc—‘They
should be neither too fat nor too lean, neither too tall nor too short,
neither too old nor too young, having at least six ancestors on both
sides famed for learning, austerity and actions, their Brāhmaṇa-hood
should be above suspicion and they should themselves be learned’; and so

Brāhmaṇa who is learned, of noble family, eloquent, handsome, of proper
age, and of virtuous disposition, who lives righteously and is austere.
With his assistance, he shall fulfil his religious duties; for it is
declared in the Veda that “Kṣatriyas who are assisted by Brāhmaṇas
prosper and do not fall into trouble.” He shall also take heed of that
which astrologers and interpreters of omens tell him.... He shall
perforin in the Fire of the Hall the rites ensuring prosperity, which
are connected with *Śānti* (allaying of portents), festivals, a
prosperous march, long life and auspiciousness; as well as those that
are intended to cause enmity, to subdue enemies, to destroy them by
incantations, and to cause their misfortune. Officiating priests shall
perform for him the other sacrifices, according to the law.’

Science of Government should he appointed as the Royal Priest; he shall

those rites that are obligatory for householders. It is declared in the
Veda that a realm where a Brāhmaṇa is appointed domestic priest,
prospers. Thus shall both his duties he fulfilled;—by himself alone the
king would be unable to do both.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.70).—‘He shall appoint as domestic priest a man conversant
with the Vedas, the Epics, the Institutes of Sacred Law, and the science
of what is useful in life,—of a good family, not deficient of limbs, and
persistent in the performance of austerities.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.312-313).—‘He shall appoint the domestic priest, who is
well versed in astrology, endowed with the aforesaid qualities, expert
in criminal law, and also in the *Atharvāṅgirasa* rites. For the
performance of *Śrauta* and *Smārta* rites, he shall appoint the
sacrificial priests and shall perform, according to law, sacrifices at

‘*Revenue*’—the tux, in the shape of the sixth part of the produce of
grains.

*By trusted men*’—by men who have been tested by means of tests.

‘*He shall stick to the scriptures*’— as detailed above. That is, he
shall have recourse to such sciences of reasoning &c. as depend mostly
upon the scriptures. Or, it may mean that he shall receive only such
part, of the produce as ‘tax’ as may be sanctioned by established usage,
never more than that.

‘*Towards the people he shall behave like a father*’.— That is, he shall
behave lovingly towards those who pay the taxes, as also towards
others.—(80)

He shall honour with gifts those Brāhmaṇas who have learnt the Veda and
studied what is contained in it in their teacher’s house and are
desirous of proceeding to Householdership.

This act of giving also is abligatory on the King. Hence it is said that
—‘*for the king this is interminable*—*i.e*., obligatory, hence
interminable, life-long. If it were voluntary, its necessity would cease
as soon as its fruits had been attained. This is exactly what is going
to be described under 11.1.

Others however hold that what is enjoined under 11.1 is the giving of
gifts to persons seeking for it, while the present context refers to
persons not seeking for gifts; hence all that is meant is that they
shall be duly honoured with such presents as those of a pair of cloth
and the like, just in obedience to the injunction laying down such
honouring, it is in view of this that the text has said ‘he shall do
honour to the Brāhmaṇas.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

That the act just mentioned *must* be performed is asserted again in
another form; What is offered into the Fire is sometimes ‘*spilt*’— it
flows out, when it is poured out; sometimes it becomes spoilt—as in the
case of the cake—by becoming overburnt. Similarly it becomes ‘wasted’—in
the eyes of all cultured men—by reason of defects in the ritualistic
detail. None of these defects is possible in the case of what is given
to Brāhmaṇas.

It is in view of this that the text asserts that this is ‘*superior to
the Fire-offerings*’—*i.e*. to the offerings poured into fire. Or, the
term ‘*Agnihotra*’ may be taken in its literal sense of the name of the
Rite; and in that case we have to supply the term ‘*et cetera*.’

‘*Offered into the mouth*.’—The hand of the Brāhmaṇa is his ‘mouth’;
according to the declaration—‘The Brāhmaṇa has been described as having
his hands for his mouth.’

‘*Superior*’—more excellent.

This is purely commendatory; and should not be taken as actually
detracting from the value of the Fire-offerings.—(84)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Chyavate*’—‘Becomes spoilt’ (Medhātithi); Kullūka reads ‘*vyathate*’
and explains it as ‘dries up’; and Rāghavānanda as ‘causes pain’.

oblation that involves no spilling and no pain, and is not tainted by
expiations.’

*Objection*:—“As a matter of fact, it has been laid down in the present
context that gifts should be made to *Brāhmaṇas* (82); and before this
also (under 3.96) it has been declared that gifts should be made ‘to a
Brāhmaṇa who knows the real meaning of the Veda.’ Then again, it cannot
be reasonable to accept the words of the text in the literal sense—that
the various kinds of gifts actually bring about the rewards in the
manner stated. For instance, of what sort is the *equableness* (between
the *gift* and the reward accruing thence, to the giver)? Is it in (*a*)
kind, or (*b*) quantity, or (*c*) utility? If it be held to be in
*kind*, then, in a case where, on the occasion of drinking a medicinal
drug, the patient makes a gift of those drags (?) to temple-worshippers,
the gift would be conducive to pain. Because medicinal drugs as a rule
are bitter, hot and pungent and tend to move the bowels. If, again the
‘equableness’ meant were in regard to *quantity*,—and there also the
equality were only in *quantity*, irrespective of the character of the
*substance*,—then a gift of *gold* might bring, as its reward, an equal
quantity of *copper*, or some such things as a clod of earth or a piece
of wood and the like. If again, the ‘equableness’ meant were both in
regard to *kind* and *quantity*, then also there would be the same
difficulties as those just pointed out. If lastly, the ‘equableness’
meant were in regard to *utility*,—then also, if the use also were of
the same kind, in that case, the use of the medicinal drugs consisting
in the curing a certain disease,—if the reward were to be of the same
kind, then it would be as good as nonexistent, if the man did not happen
to suffer from the same disease; so that the gift of those drugs would
have to make the giver subject to that disease again, or some other
disease of the same degree of seriousness. For these reasons, the
declarations contained in the present verse should not be regarded as
distinct sentences standing by themselves. Just as in the case of the
Vedic declarations—‘The *Nivīta* form is for human beings end the
*Upavīta* for divine beings; so that when the man adopts the *Upavīta*
form, he takes upon himself a mark of the gods’,—what is said in regard
to the *Nivīta* and the rest is not taken as distinct from what is said
regarding the adopting of the *Upavīta* form.”

The answer to the above is as follows:—In the present text we do not.
find any verb in any of the sentences, every one of which, therefore,
stands on the same footing. If it is a commendatory description, then
this can apply only to the statement ‘that to the man learned in the
Veda, endless.’ If again, it is an Injunction, then all the sentences
should be regarded as equally injunctive; there is nothing to indicate
that any one of them is subservient to any other. In the case of the
passage regarding the ‘*Nivīta*’ &c on the other hand, we find a verb
in the term ‘*upavyayate*’ (‘adopts the *upavīta* form’); so that the
sentence containing it fulfilling the conditions of an Injunctive
sentence, it is only right that the others should be taken as
subservient to it.

As for the argument that no gifts to a Non-Brāhmaṇa can be
possible,—this must be due to the objector having forgotten that gifts
to the poor and helpless of all castes have been enjoined. In fact it is
only in regard to gifts to be made by Kings to *Brāhmaṇas* that we have
the sentences in the present verse.

As regards the argument that “there is no possibility of rewards
accruing in the manner stated in the text, on account of all the various
methods indicated bring, open to objection,”—our answer is as
follows;—The mode of expression adopted here is that of ordinary
parlance. In ordinary parlance, what is not *very* *good* is called
‘equable’; *e*. *g*. in such expressions as ‘the Saktu contains an
equable supply of salt.’ As for the reward being ‘*two-fold?*, the
two-foldness meant is in regard to *utility*; the meaning bring that the
reward is doubly as useful as the original gift. It is not meant either
that the same *kind* of substance is obtained in return, or that the
*utility* is of the same kind; all that is meant is that the degree of
*happiness* produced is twice as much. Further, as a matter of fact, the
verse is not meant to be an ‘injunction of rewards’; so that there is no
room for the raising of any such questions as to whether it is the
*same* *substance*, or another substance, that is obtained in reward.
Specially as in cases where no rewards ore mentioned, the attainment of
Heaven is always regarded as the reward. Then again, in connection with
the giving of sesamum, the obtaining of children has been declared to be
the reward; and certainly in such a case there can be no possibility of
the reward being of the same *kind* as the gift. Thus all that is meant
here, and also in the subsequent passages, is that the excellence of the
recipient adds to the excellence of the gift. This is exactly what is
emphasised in the next verse.

In the term ‘*brāhmaṇa—bruva*’ (‘nominal Brāhmaṇa’)—the particle
‘*bruva*’ has a derogatory sense; it staṇḍs for one who is Brāhmaṇa by
caste only, and is wholly devoid of learning and other qualities.

‘*Teacher*’—the Initiator.

‘*A person thoroughly learned in the Veda*,’—one who has, by learning
and study, got to the end of the Veda.—(85)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Samam*’—‘Middling’ (Medhātithi);—‘neither more nor less than what is
described in the scriptures’ (Kullūka and Govindarāja);—‘equal to the
kindness shown’ (Nārāyaṇa).

*Gautama* (5.20).—‘The reward of a gift to a non-Brāhmaṇa is equal to
the value of the gift; that of what is given to a Brāhmaṇa is twofold;
that of what is given to a Vedic scholar, thousandfold; and that of what
is given to one thoroughly versed in the Veda, endless.’

*Viṣṇu* (93.1-4).—‘What is given to a non-Brāhmaṇa produces the same
fruit in the world to come;—what is given to one who calls himself a
Brāhmaṇa produces twice the same fruit;—what is given to one who has
studied the main portions of the Veda produces a thousand times the same
fruits;—what is given to one who has mastered the whole Veda, produces
infinite fruit.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.201).—‘Cows, land, gold and other things are to be
offered, with respect, to proper recipients; a man desiring his own
welfare shall give nothing to an improper person.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 286).—‘The cow, the horse, the gold and the
land, on seeing the hands of a Brāhmaṇa ignorant of the Veda, decries
the giver.’

The term ‘*pātra*’ etymologically signifies either (*a*) ‘one who saves
from sinful deeds’, or (*b*) ‘one who saves and protects
himself’;—*i.e*., the *recipient*; or the *recipient* is called
‘*pātra*’ in the same sense in which the vessel containing clarified
butter is called its ‘*pātra*’; the substance given away is deposited in
the *recipient* in the same manner in which the butter is deposited in
the vessel. This is what has been declared above (82)—“For kings this is
interminable, and has been called *Brahmic treasure*.”

The ‘*peculiar character*’ of the recipient consists in his possessing
or not possessing, proper qualifications. It is by reason of these
qualifications that rewards of gifts are obtained.

‘*Or small*.’—When the gift is mads to one who is possessed of excellent
qualifications, in the shape of character and Vedic learning, it brings
a ‘*great*’ reward, and when made to one who has no qualifications, it
brings a *small* reward.

‘*According to his own faith*.’ To this effect we have the following

Here ‘*place*’ stands for the ‘right place’, which is that which is
other than the village inhabited by the giver himself; people away from
their homes are likely to be subject to many inconveniences and wants,
which may he removed by the gift;—‘*Time*’—when some one who is
performing a sacrifice happens to run short of necessary supplies; or
when an eclipse takes place; ‘*Form*’—the pouring of water, the
pronouncing of the syllable ‘*Svasti*’ by the recipient, the proper
preparation of the substance given away, the sweetness of disposition
with which the gift is made; and so forth;

‘*Substance*’— cow, land, gold and so forth.

‘*Faith*’—a keen desire for fulfilment, the determination as to ‘how
this may be accomplished.’

‘*After death*.’—This only indicates that the reward does not always
follow immediately after the act of giving; it does not mean that it
accrues always during the next life; specially as all that is meant in
the case of all acts enjoined in the Veda is that they must bring their
reward (and nothing is indicated regarding the time at which the reward
is to accrue).—(86)

War has been enjoined as the last resource for the king, when -all other
means nave failed; and when once war has been entered into and the king
has reached the battle-field, and has been challenged by his enemy,—he
shall not show any sort of indifference; this is what is meant by the
present verse; which means that he shall not entertain any such notion
as—‘I shall not strike at a weak enemy.’

Or, when robbers and others, in sheer disregard for the established law,
attack the people,—or join the king’s enemies,—if such persons cannot be
subdued without war,—then the king must go to war with them, even though
they be weak. Though in a case like this, the king is not actually
‘challenged’ by the robbers in so many wards, yet, for all practical
purposes, he is as good as ‘challenged’.

It is ‘*the duty of the Kṣatriya*’ that whenever he is challenged, he
must fight, whoever the challenger may be, and he shall take no account
of the caste or age or training or ambition etc. of the other party.
This duty the King has to bear in mind.—(87)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Āhava*’ is that where heroes are *challenged* by one another to fight,
*i.e*., the battle; vying with one another and ‘*seeking to slay each
other*’;—‘*fighting*’— striking —‘*with great energy*’—to the utmost of
their power. It is on account of metrical exigencies that in place of
‘*parayā*’ (as qualifying ‘*śaktyā*’) we have the form ‘*param*’.

‘*Without turning back*’;—this is to be construed with
‘*fighting*’;—*proceed to heaven*.’

*Objection*—“As a matter of fact, the action taken by kings is
instigated by a love for territorial expansion; so that an ordinary
physical reward being possible, why should Heaven be mentioned as the
reward?”

Heaven is mentioned as the reward in connection with the observance of
the rules of war going to be described; for the observance of these
rules there can be no other motive. Even the king who has renounced his
kingdom may observe the rules laid down in the next and following
verses, and by surrendering to the powerful enemy he would become
entitled to the trancendental reward (Heaven; there being no possibility
of his winning any territories). Or again, when a king, on suffering
defeat in battle, enters the fray (in sheer desperation), this act can
only lead to Heaven. And on the strength of the present verse, such
desperate fighting could not fall within the purview of the prohibition
of self-immolation.

‘*Kings*’—Rulers of provinces; not those under them; as the action of
these latter is prompted by the interest of their masters and not by any
interest of their own; under the circumstances, how could there be any
rewards for them? In fact, their case is analogous to that of the
Priests whose services have been secured by means of a stipulation
regarding fees; so that in the case of the king’s underlings also, in as
much as their service has been secured by means of wages, how could
there be any reward in the shape of Heaven or the like?

“But under 5-97, it has been declared without any reservation that the
sacrifice is immediately accomplished for the *Kṣatriya* who is killed
by means of uplifted weapons, in due accordance with the duties of the
Kṣatriya; and again—‘those two persons pierce through the solar orb—the
Renunciate is meditation and the hero killed in the forefront of
battle’;—further, in the Mahābhārata, it has been declared that Heaven
is attained even by those who witness the battle. There are Vedic texts
indicative of the same fact; *e.g*., ‘Those brave men who fight in
battles and give up their bodies there, as also those who pay a thousand
as the sacrificial fee, go to the Gods,’—which shows that great rewards
accrue to those sacrificers who pay a thousand as sacrificial fees,—‘as
also those brave persons who give up their lives in battle’. Further,
the text speaks of ‘those who fight,’ and not ‘those who have sold
themselves for dying (for others);’ specially as there is no such
stipulation made at the time that the man’s services are engaged. In the
case of the officiating priests, the *Hotṛ*, the *Udgātṛ* and the rest,
their appointment is for the express purpose of performing those
priestly duties that are indicated by their titles. From all this it
follows that even in the case of a map dying in serving his master,
there is transcendental reward. Nor is there any such hard and fast rale
as that there can be no reward in the case of an act prompted by the
purposes of another man. In fact the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa becomes
purified by bathing at the Final Bath of the *Aśvamedha* sacrifice,
where he is not the performer of the sacrifice.”

The answer to the above is as follows:—As a matter of fact, the giving
up of his life by the king for the benefit of his people is actually
conducive to merit. As regards what has been said regarding the losing
of one’s life in battle being tantamount to the accomplishment of a
sacrifice,—this must refer to the man whose services have been engaged
on a salary and who, not being his own master, enters the battle simply
on the word of command to ‘march forward’. This is the person meant by
the expression ‘who is killed in the fore-front of battle.’

Or, the ‘piercing of the solar orb’ by the man fighting in battle would
mean only *being saved from hell*. In a case where a king’s realm is
attacked and pillaged by another king, and his people are being
massacred, if the former undertakes to fight against him and loses his
life in the fray, this would be conducive to merit. If he does not
fight, he falls into ‘blind darkness’, which means *Hell*, on account of
the total absence of light there. What the ‘piercing of the solar orb’
means is that the man reaches the regions beyond the solar regions;
*i.e*., he does not fall downwards. When a man has accepted service on
pay, under a master, if he fails tonight for his master in battle, and
abandons him, his fall into hell is certain. On the other hand, if the
man has fought his master’s battle and has become free from the debt of
the wages he has received from him,—if he is not bowed down by his
sins,—it is only natural that he should attain heaven, by virtue of his
own meritorious acts. It is in view of this that it has been declared
that ‘his sacrifice becomes immediately accomplished’. Thus also the
passage in the Mahābhārata becomes reconciled, where it is said that
persons who have accepted service in the army attain heaven. As for the
mention of Heaven being attained by persons ‘witnessing the battle’,
this must be regarded as a commendatory exaggeration.

Or, the meaning of all this may be that, there being many means of
livelihood, living by military service is sure to lead to heaven.

As regards the argument that it is not for dying that the men are
engaged in military service,—in reality when soldiers are paid their
wages, it is for no other purpose than for fighting; specially as no
other purpose has been mentioned. The men are engaged by the master with
the view that ‘they shall be ready for all kinds of work and shall help
me in all my undertakings.’ So that when a war breaks out, it becomes
their duty to do everything for their master, even up to the giving up
of the body; and thus alone is he able to repay his master. When,
however, there is no war, if the servant happens to die, then he dies a
servant (and not one freed from bondage); as the repayment of his debt
is accomplished only if he accomplishes some purpose of his master,
similar to that for which he has been engaged. as for the texts quoted
as indicating the attainment of heaven by men dying in battle,—these
also become reconciled in the above manner.

What has been mid regarding the murderer becoming freed from sins by
bathing at the Final Bath of the *Aśvamedha* is accepted on the strength
of the direct assertion to that effect, contained in such texts
as—‘Hence on their association etc. etc.’; while in the present instance
going upward is stated to be the result of fighting;—and this
constitutes a difference between the two cases (which, thus, cannot be
regarded as analogous).—(89)

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 405).—‘For the sake of his people,
the king shall fight, and even give up his life; thereby he obtains the
reward of a Horse-Sacrifice. If a man, without turning back, is killed
in battle by his enemies, he obtains the regions of Indra, won by his
valour.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 406).—‘The Kṣatriya resides on the chest of the
Kṣatriya, and the Brāhmaṇa at his back; therefore he should always guard
his back in battle; or else he becomes a Brāhmaṇa-killer.’

‘*Naked*’.—‘*Bhagnam*’, ‘broken’, ‘defeated’, is another reading.
Fighting with one without hie arrows having been forbidden, there is no
possibility of any one engaging a ‘*naked*’ person. Hence ‘nakedness’
should be taken as referring to that *partial* nakedness which consists
in *being deprived of the turban or some such part of his armour*. As
regards the ‘*broken*’ or ‘defeated’ man also,—since fighting with ‘one
who has turned to flight’ is also forbidden (in 93),—it means that when
the enemy who, though still facing his victorious foe, says ‘I shall not
fight with you any longer’, he shall not be pressed to continue the
fight.

‘*Nor one who is only looking on and not lighting*’;—the mere on-looker
should not be struck; this prohibition however does not apply to the man
who looks on, as well as fights.

‘*One engaged in fighting with another person*’;—a man who is fighting
one person should not be struck by another.—(92)

‘*Difficulties regarding weapons*’—such as the breaking of weapons, the
sword becoming crooked, the snapping of the bowstring and so forth.

‘*In distress*’—on having lost his son or brother or some other
relative.

‘*Frightened*’— showing such signs of fear as the paleness of face and
the like, even though still facing his foe.

‘*Turned back*’— starding with his face turned away.

These are positive rules to be observed. If they are to be regarded as
prohibitions, the non-observance of them would be sinful; \[which would
mean that their observance would simply save the man from that sin, and
in that case\] the declaration regarding the attaining of Heaven would
be purely commendatory.

What then is the right view to take regarding these rules?

They are prohibitions set up for the man’s benefit, standing on the same
footing as the prohibition of eating the flesh of the animal killed by a
poisoned arrow. It is only when we take the rules thus that the negative
word retains its primary meaning.

‘*Remembering the duties of honourable men*’—the sense of ‘*anu*’ is
that such is the usage of all cultured men.—(93)

It should not be thought that ‘if the man is killed after having turned
back, he does not die after having committed a sinful deed’; because the
offence lies in his having *turned back*. Further, the man should not
entertain the notion that ‘by becoming wounded I have repaid my debt to
the master; and have fulfilled my duty towards him’; because such wounds
serve no useful purpose at all. This is what is indicated by pointing
out the gravity of the offence involved. What is said in the present
verse regarding the master’s sins falling upon the servant, as also what
follows in the next verse regarding the master taking off the merit of
the servant,—all this is purely commendatory; for the acts of one man,
either good or bad, cannot accrue to another; nor can there be a total
annihilation of a meritorious act. All that is possible is that, when
there is an obstruction caused by a grievous sin, the fruition of the
meritorious act is delayed. This is all that is meant in the present
context.—(94)

‘*Earned for the next world*.’—This shows that there is some purpose
served. The term ‘*amutrārtham*’ is formed with the ‘*ach*’ affix,
according to the rule governing the ‘*arshas* group’. The meaning
is—‘what has been earned for some purpose to be fulfilled in the next
world, becomes lost (nullified) for him’.

Or, the compound may be expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*—‘that whose purpose
or use pertains to the next world’. This explanation would be justified
by the sense and also by its usefulness.—(95)

‘*Baser metals*’—utensils of copper etc. as also beds and chairs etc.

‘*Belong to him who wins them*.’— The king being the master of all, he
might take away all the spoils of war; hence the text mentions a few
exceptions.

Gold, silver, lands, buildings and so forth accrue to the King; hence
the necessity of enumerating those that do not go to him. Arms and
conveyances also accrue to the King.

‘*Grains*’ and other things being mentioned separately, the term
‘wealth’ stands for cows, buffalos etc.

It is is view of all this that there is the popular saying—Half belongs
to the King’.—(96)

A particular detail is laid down in connection with the rule that ‘what
has been won by one man shall be taken by him.’

The soldiers shall, of their own accord, ‘*present to the king the
choice portion*’; *i.e*., they shall select their best object and
present it to the king; and they shall not take all the booty
themselves.

‘*Such is the Vedic Declaration*.’—The Vedic passage starting with the
words ‘*Indro vai vṛttram hatvā*’ (Indra having killed Vṛttra), goes on
to say—he having become great said to the Gods *present to me the choice
portion*.’ (*Aitareya Brāhmaṇa*, 3.21).

In a case where the booty has been won by the King himself, or where it
has not been won by any soldier individually, where no such distinction
is possible as ‘this village has been won by this man and that by that
man’, and where the enemy and his allies have been annihilated by all
combined,—the division among his servants is to be made by the King, in
accordance with the maxim of ‘bestowing on worthy recipients.’—(97)

collectively.’

The means of accomplishing the purposes of man are of four kinds. That
is, the following four steps should be taken towards that end:—*viz*:
acquiring, saving, augmenting and giving.

The term ‘*artha*’, ‘purpose’, stands for what is helpful; the meaning
therefore is that what is mentioned here is the means for accomplishing
what is helpful for man; these four Shall be always put into practice:

He who has his force operative, is called ‘*Udyatadaṇḍaḥ*’; *i.e*.,
having his force in operation. For instance, the elephants and other
constituents of the army he shall train by constant exercise; *i.e*.,
they shall all be disciplined by being regularly driven and trained; the
exercise shall be regular; their clothing and accoutrements shall be
kept in train. This is what is meant by the force being ‘operative’; if
this is done, it shows to the people in his kingdom that he is equipped
with prowess and energy.

Similarly he shall have ‘*his manliness displayed*’; he should show,
render manifest, his powers; *i.e*., at boundary-posts, and forests he
should keep watch-men, imbued with courage, fully armed and armoured.

‘*His secrets ever concealed*’;—he shall determine what should be
concealed, and then keeping that to himself, he shall conceal it, with
due care by guarding it against prying and thwarting by others.

He shall always follow up the weak points of his enemies; shall find out
their intentions and try to thwart them.—(102)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, pp. 133-134), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Udyatadaṇḍaḥ*’—‘daṇḍa’ here stands for the
training and exercise of the elephants, horses and other compliments of
the army; and this should be ‘*udyata*’, ever active, ready;—or
‘*daṇda*’ may stand for ‘punishment of the wicked,’ and this should be
‘*udyata*’, always inflicted in time.—‘*Vivṛtapauruṣaḥ*’—he whose
‘*pauruṣa*’ *manliness*, *i.e*., superiority in the knowledge and use of
weapons, is ‘*vivṛta*,’ *displayed*;—‘*sambṛtasaṃvāryaḥ*’—he whose

‘*Māyā*’, ‘*guile*’, is Treachery; with that he shall never behave; as
by doing so, he would not be trustworthy. Nor shall he try to alienate
the subjects of other kings, until their inclinations have been
ascertained. But ‘*the guiles employed by his enemies he shall fathom*’
and understand in their true character; and having found out the guiles,
he should proceed to win over the enemy’s men.

The *modus operandi* of this is fourfold—as through (*a*) the angry,
(*b*) he covetous, (*c*). the frightened and (*d*) the ill-treated.

(*a*) When a man has done some artistic work, or some one has done
something beneficial to the king,—such persona are either (1) cheated,
or (2) presented with reward, or (3) ill-treated, and at this other
artists and helpers also become angry—at the thought that—‘this king
does not appreciate our art or help’. Such persons an fit for being
approached for alienation. Similarly when a person, hitherto honoured
and treated with affection, comes to fall off from honour and office,
his friends and relations banished, himself imprisoned along with his
family, his entire property confiscated,—and another person with similar
qualifications becomes honoured in his place,—then the former and others
like him constitute the ‘*angry*’.

(*b*) When a wicked act has been done by some person, and he has been
punished, other persons, who have committed the same offence are in
constant dread of that same punishment; similarly persons in high
office, who may have failed in their duty, and others in like position
constitute the ‘*frightened*’ set.

(*c*) The poverty-stricken, the miserly, the profligate, the man
immersed in debt and so forth constitute the ‘*covetous*’ set.

(*d*) When the Self-respecting person, seeking honour at the bunds of
the King’s enemy, is ‘on the contrary) struck by him, he, being of a
fiery temper and brave, becomes highly incensed at such treatment;—such
persons constitute the ‘*ill-treated*’ set.

The King shall attempt the alienation of all such persons from the other
King; and at the same time he shall take care regarding similar people
on his own side.—(104)

The same idea is farther reiterated.

The king shall so act that while he becomes apprised of the enemy’s weak
points, his own remain carefully guarded. When he finds out, through his
trusted spies, that any of his own people belongs to one of the
aforesaid four sets of the ‘angered’ and the rest, he should try to
conciliate them.

His departments he shall hide, like the tortoise, and he shall also
guard his weak points. The guarding of one’s own weak points against the
enemy’s approaches is highly important;—this is what is meant by the
present verse.—(105)

the weak points of the enemy, such as disaffection among the people and
so forth; just as the tortoise hides within its body its head and other
limbs, in the same manner should he always keep won over to his side, by
bestowing gifts and honours, his own ministers and other officers of
state; and if, by chance, some disaffection should happen to arise among
his people, he should take remedial measures at once.

When large bodies of fish are hidden within their fortress in the water,
the heron, with a view to catch them, adopts the plan of appearing
indifferent, as if rapt in contemplation, and thereby succeeds in
getting at them; in the same manner, even things difficult of attainment
are attained by much care and attention being devoted to them. With this
idea in his mind, the King should not give up hopes regarding the things
sought to be attained.

Then again, the hare, being small of body, is capable of doubling back
in retreat even from among a host of pursuers; similarly even though
alone and helpless, having all his feudatory chiefs risen against him
and being incapable of making a stand against them, the King should
allow his enemies to enter the fortress, and then double back in
retreat, with a view to seeking refuge under a powerful ally.

Further, the wolf, with a view to seizing its prey, finding the keepers
of the sheep careless, snatches it away; in the same manner the King
shall not give up the idea of pouncing upon his enemy, under the
impression that the latter is watchful of his own safety; because the
time may come when he may be able, like the wolf, to get at him.

Lastly, the lion kills even such large-bodied animals as the elephant
and the rest, by virtue of its valour and strength; similarly the King
should not be frightened by the enemy simply because the latter has a
large army; because even a weak person, if imbued with courage,
sometimes succeeds in killing a powerful person.—(106)

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 279).—‘Conciliation,
dissension, gifts, force, ignoring, guile and magic are the seven
expedients. Conciliation is of two kinds—real and unreal; of these the
unreal tends only to censure from all good men; the good man is always
tractable by conciliation; so also men of noble families, honest men and
righteous persons, and those who have control over their senses; towards
those the king shall never employ the *unreal* form of conciliation.
Real conciliation consists in describing the noble family and character
of the other party, and also the benefits that have been received from
him...... Towards the wicked conciliation is to be avoided, as they
misunderstand it as arising from fear.’

*Agni-purāṇa* (Do., p. 280).—‘Conciliation is of four kinds:—describing
the benefits conferred by the other party, pointing out the mutual bonds
of relationship, sweet speech, and describing future possibilities.’

When certain persons plot against the King, the friends and relations of
such persons, as also those that seek to enter into relationship with
them, should not all be ruined,—if they are not in the secret of their
machinations; those alone shall be proceeded against who are actually
wicked, and not his relations; this is what is shown by means of the
instance of the ‘weeder.’

Though the corn and the weed grow together and are in dose touch with
one another, yet the weeder cleverly preserves the corn and plucks out
the weeds; in the same manner from among the plotters and their friends;
those alone should be punished who have actually committed the offence,
and not those who are only related to them. Thus with due discrimination
between the good and the wicked, the former shall be preserved and the
latter punished.—(110)

guards*’,—*i*. *e*., a police-outpost;—and he shall appoint an
‘*administrator*’ supplied with such guards. The term ‘*saṅgraha*’
stands for the administrating officer.

Similarly in the midst of three or fire villages.

Or ‘*Saṅgraha*’ may be taken as standing for the place for collecting of
monies due to the king.—(114)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 248), which
supplies the following explanation:—In the midst of two hundred, or
three hundred, of five hundred villages, he should establish an outpost,
containing a detachment of infantry and others;—if we read ‘*rāṣṭrasya
saṅgraham*’ (in place of ‘*rāṣṭrasya guptaye*) the meaning would be that
he should establish a *saṅgraha*, *i.e*., a ‘guard’ consisting of a
‘*gulma*’ an outpost, and ‘*avasthita*’ supervised by honest
officers.—The option regarding the extent of each charge is based upon
the diversity in the strength of robbers and other mischief-makers in
varying areas.

Now follows the system of realising duties.

At what price the merchandise has been bought—what price it will fetch
when sold—what time it will take in selling—what deterioration, if any,
it is likely to suffer—the consideration of all this constitutes the
‘*investigation of the details of buying and selling*’.

‘*Journey*’—whether it takes much or little time to obtain it.

‘*Fooding*’—Flour, Rice &c.

‘*Accessories*’—*e.g*. butter, pulse, vegetables; as also fuel and such
things.

‘*Measures of safety*’—*i.e*. when passing through forests whether or
not things were secure against molestation by kings and robbers.

Having duly investigated all these, the King shall realise duties from
the traders.

The right reading is ‘*vaṇigbhir dāpayet karān*’; because according to
the *sūtra* ‘*gatibuddhi* &c.’ (Panini), there is nothing to justify the
Accusative case in ‘*vaṇijaḥ*,’ Or, the root in ‘*dāpayet*’ may mean
‘fine’, and hence like the root ‘*daṇḍī*’, it may take two objects
(which would justify the said Accusative ending).—(127)

‘*Yoyakṣemam*’—‘Charges incurred for security of property against
royalty and thieves and robbers’ (Medhātithi);—‘net profits (*yoga*) and
charges for securing the goods against robbers &c.’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 259), which adds
the following notes:—What has been paid for the cloth, salt and other
articles of merchandise? What are likely to be the profits from selling
them? From what distance has all this been brought? What quantity of
food and vegetables and condiments have been spent by the man in
importing the goods? How much he has lost over the charges incurred in
securing his goods against robbers and other dangers of the journey?
What is the profit he is actually making? What is he spending over the
guarding of his merchandise against robbers and thieves?—the King should
take into consideration all this and then fix the taxes payable by the
traders.

‘*In the ease of cattle and gold*’—which are of high value—‘*the
fiftieth part shall be taken by the Ring*’.

‘*In the case of grains*’—the exact share to be taken is to be
determined in accordance with the greater or less labour involved in the
producing of each kind.

‘*Pañcāśaḥ*’—the fiftieth; the affix being ‘*tamaṭ*’. If the reading be
‘*pañcāthadbhāgah*,’ it would be similar to such expressions as
‘*dvibhāga*’ (‘two parts’) and the like; and in that case it would stand
for a totally different number (meaning ‘fifty parts’).—(130)

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p.
262), which remarks that the option laid down is in view of the varying
fertility of the soil and the consequent greater or less labour involved
in cultivation; it explains ‘*dhānya*’ as standing for *Vrīhi*, *Yava*
and so forth and adds that what is here mentioned is to be realised only
from cultivators.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

See above, 10, 118 and 120.

*Gautama* (10.24, 25),—‘Cultivators should pay to the king a tax
amounting to one-tenth, one-eighth, or one-sixth of the produce. Some
declare that there is a tax also on cattle and gold, *viz*., one-fifth
of the stock.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.18.1).—‘The king shall protect his subjects, receiving
as his wage a sixth part of their incomes.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.42).—‘A king who rules according to the sacred law may
take the sixth part of the wealth of his subjects.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.22-24).—‘He should lake from his subjects as taxes a sixth
part of every ear of the corn, and a sixth part of all other seeds;—two
in the hundred, of cattle, gold and clothes.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 262).—‘Of awned grains,
the sixth part, of leguminous grains, the eighth part, shall be taken by
the king as the tax.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do., p. 263).—‘The cultivator shall pay to the king, (*a*)
the tenth, (*b*) eighth and (*c*) sixth parts of the produce (*a*) from
fallow land (*b*) of the autumn crop and (*c*) the spring crop,
respectively. “They shall pay taxes six-monthly or yearly, in accordance
with the custom of *the country*; such is the eternal duty of
cultivators.”

*Śukranīti* (4.2.212 *et. seq*.)—‘*Duty* is the king’s share received
from the buyer and the seller. The regions of the duty arc the
market-place, streets and mines. Duties are to he levied on goods only
once. The king should receive the thirty-second portion from the seller
or buyer. The twentieth or the sixteenth part is not a drawback upon the
price. The king shall not realise duty from the seller when he receives
what is less than cost price for his commodity; he shall realise it from
the buyer on finding him to be the gainer. Having ascertained the amount
of produce from the measured plots of land, the king shall demand
revenue, apportioning it among the cultivators. The king shall realise
rent from the peasant in such a way as may not ruin him. The king should
realise one-third, one-fourth, or one-half from places irrigated by
tanks, canals and wells, by rains and by rivers respectively, he should
have one-sixth from barren and rocky soils. If the king realises from
one cultivator 100 silver *kārṣāpaṇas*, he should refund to him 20
*Karṣas*. For minerals, the king shall realise duty at the following
rates after deducting the expenses incurred:—Half of gold, one-third of
silver, one-fourth of copper, one-sixth of zinc and iron, half of gems,
half of glass and lead. He should realise one-third, one-fifth,
one-seventh, one-tenth and one-twentieth from the collectors of grasses
and foods. He should have one-eighth of the increase of goats, sheep,
cows, buffaloes and horses, and one-sixteenth of the milk of buffaloes,
she-goats, and ewes. Artists and artisans he shall make work for him one
day in the fortnight. If the people start new industries or cultivate
new lands, dig tanks, canals or wells, etc., the king should not demand
anything from them until they have realised a profit double the amount
spent by them. Having determined the land-revenue for each village, the
king should receive it in advance from one rich man, or a guarantee of
monthly or periodical payments. He should realise the one-thirty-second
portion of the income of the money-lender. He should receive rents from
houses and cultivated lands; also land-tax from shopkeepers; for the
preservation and repairs of streets, he should realise dues from the
users.’

The ‘cutting off of his own root’ consists in not realising taxes and
duties; and excessive taxation constitutes the ‘cutting off of the root
of others’; and as a matter of course, the latter is due to excessive
greed; and this is what is reiterated in the text.

The ‘cutting off of his own root’ causes Suffering to the King himself,
by the depletion of his treasury. From the same cause others also come
to suffer. For if a war were to break out, and the King’s finances
happened to be low, his defeat and destruc tion would be certain; and
this would constitute a great suffering for the people.

On the other hand, if the King were to realise taxes at all times of the
year, this also makes the people wretched.—(139)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.338-339).—‘The king, who unlawfully adds to his
treasury out of the kingdom, speedily perishes along with his relations,
losing all his prosperity. The fire arising out of the heat produced by
harassing the people, is extinguished only after having burnt the king’s
prosperity, family and life.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 276).—‘The king who unlawfully

This text describes the evil arising from neglecting the watchfulness
laid down in the preceding verse.

If the king is not awake to the necessity of establishing outposts, then
his subjects are carried off by robbers, who are ever on the look out
for such loopholes; and what can the King do for the subjects? Such a
King would be as good as dead. His very living is death itself. For this
reason the King should be ever watchful.

‘*Screaming*’— crying —‘*are carried away*’;—‘*while, along with his
servants the King is looking on*.’ The evil is bound, under the
circumstances, to be simply looked upon helplessly; the King’s servants
can only look on, they cannot chase the robbers and free the people from
their clutches; all these are as good as dead.

The ‘*last watch*’ stands for the ‘*Brāhma-muhūrta*’, the ‘time sacred
to Brahman’; that it is so is indicated by the terms ‘*having performed
his ablutions*’, and ‘*with collected mind*’.

‘*Having poured the libations into Fire*’;—the performance of this act
of Homa-offering is not to be done during the ‘*Brahma-muhūrta*’; ince
at that time *four muhūrtas* (3 hours, 12 minutes) of the night would be
still left, while the Homa-offering has been laid down as to be done
when the night has dawned. So what all this means is simply—‘having
accomplished all that is to be done at dawn’.

‘*Having honoured*’ worshipped—‘*the Brāhmaṇas*’—‘*he shall enter the
auspicious Hall of Audience*’—equipped with auspicious marks.—(145)

‘There’—in that hall—‘*staying*’,—‘*he shall welcome*’— gratify with
proper forms of address, looks, marks of respect and salutation—‘*the
subjects*’— who happen to come to see him,—‘*and then send them
away*’,—permit them to go as they had come.

Then, often the people have been sent off, ‘*he shall take counsel with
his ministers*’,—discussing what should be done in connection with
matters relating to his own kingdom and that of other Kings. The five
requisites of ‘Counsel’ are now described.

Those requisites of ‘counsel’ are as follows:—The means of undertaking a
project, (2) the supply of men and material, (3) due apportionment of
place and time, (4) remedy for miscarriage, and (5) success of the
project.

What the verse means is that the King shall not trespass upon the time
for listening to the prayers of the people. It is possible that the
sitting of the council may be prolonged; and of this he shall not apeak
to the men; he shall keep his counsel secret.—(146)

**(verses 7.147-148)**

*Yājñavalkya* (1.313).—‘Kingship is based upon counsel; hence counsel
should be always so guarded as people may not know of it till it has
borne fruit.’

*Agnipurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 308).—‘The king shall keep his
counsel well-guarded; since from unguarded counsel follow troubles;
secret counsel is divulged by women and dishonoured persons.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 309).—‘The king should
always keep his counsel hidden; if he cannot keep it hidden he shall
surely fall into trouble. That king alone has the whole earth under his
power, whose acts are known only when they have been completed, and
never when they have only been begun. Kingship is based upon counsel;
hence counsel should be always kept well-guarded by kings.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 71).—‘The place for bolding counsel should be hidden,
from where no sound can escape and which shall not be visible even to
birds. None should enter it unless permitted by the king.

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 73).—‘The followers of Parāśara have held that the
best way of obtaining advice and yet keeping the project secret is to
place before the ministers not the actual project, but a hypothetical
case somewhat similar to it.—This is denied by Piśuna on the ground that
if questioned in regard to irrelevant issues, the councillors would
offer opinions without due consideration and to blab about it; therefore
the king shall hold counsel with only those councillors who may be known
as experts in the matter under consideration.—This also is not right,
says Kauṭilya; as in this case the number of councillors will have to be
endless; the king shall therefore hold counsel only with three or four
councillors. If only one were consulted he would talk without any
restraint, and the right conclusion would not be arrived at;—if two only
were consulted, there would be chances of collusion between them and the
king might he placed in a difficult situation. These dangers would he
avoided by consulting three or four men.’

*Kāmandaka* (11.72).—‘The king should hold counsel in a place on the
roof of his palace,—or in a forest, where there are no pillars, no
windows and no nook or corner. He should also see that he is not watched
by any one.’

When he is holding counsel, the King shall remove every kind of living
being from the place; he shall send them all away from there, for fear
of his secrets leaking out.

Among *animals* also, parrots and such others often disclose secrets;
cows and horses also, under the influence of some magical art, have been
heard to have their shape transformed and thereby made carriers of good
and bad news; and we hear of such Kingly arts as those of making animals
to disappear and so forth.

The ‘idiot’ and the rest being already included under the ‘maimed’, the
separate mention of all these is analogous to the expression
‘*go-balīvarda*’ (where even though the *balīvarda*, ox, is included
under the ‘*go*’, yet it is mentioned separately; and the ‘maimed’ have
been mentioned separately with a view to preclude the notion being
entertained that ‘the maimed person, being without bands and feet,
cannot go out, he must stay locked up on, so that how could he divulge
our secret?’

Or, the verse may mean that the persons specified shall not be made
councillors, on account of the possibility of their intellect being
defective,—and hence they should not be confided in either; so that it
becomes necessary that they shall be sent away.—(149)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*The attainment*’,—bringing together—‘*of these, mutually
irreconcilable*’—*i.e*., *of morality, pleasure and wealth*,—or of the
*ministers*;—‘*the giving away of daughters*’;—all this should be
deliberated upon, in connection with the success of his business; also
the ‘*guardianship of his sons*’, the princes.

The princes should be made to accept morality and wealth, by the king
saying such words be ‘I am your own’. When they come by money for the
first time, they spend it just as they happen to be advised, and they
generally waste it; and evil-minded men take from them whatever they ask
for;—if they happen to associate with wicked men, they imbibe their
character; and being thus poisoned with evil tendencies, they cannot be
kept away from vices; for, as has been said—‘it is impossible for the
colour of saffron to be put upon a cloth already tinged with blue’. For
this reason the princes have to be constantly instructed. Among them
again, those that are possessed of better qualities should receive
advancement; the others receiving comparatively little for their share.
The eldest of them, who is highly qualified and free from jealousies,
should be installed as heir-apparent. In this manner the king shall
always take care to guard the princes.—(152)

on p. 317, where the following notes are added—‘*Teṣām*,’ stands for
‘Dharma’—Artha—Kāma’, among whom, in most cases, there is
conflict;—‘*samupārjanam*,’ means ‘attainment, in the proper manner,
*i.e*., the attainment of one or the other out of the three, without
detriment to the other two factors.’

He shall deliberate upon the sending of ambassadors to the king with
whom he intends to enter into alliance, or on whom he is going to
declare war.

He shell also deliberate upon the ‘*remaining details*’ of such
undertakings as have been already taken in hand,—with a view to complete
them.

Protected by a trusted body-guard, he shall enter the harem situated in
another apartment of his palace; and there he shall visit the senior and
absolutely pure and trusted queen, and not one who is not pure and free
from suspicions. For one Bhadrasena, the king’s brother, hidden in one
of the rooms and under the bed of his mother, once killed the king;—a
queen struck the king of Avanti on his abdomen with her anklet besmeared
with poison, through her association with another man; another queen
struck the King Viduratha of Sauvīra with a weapon hidden in her hair.
So all these secret places the king shall examine with care; and he
shall prohibit the association of the maids of his harem with strangers
with shaved head or with matted locks, or with maid-servants from
outside.

He shall deliberate also upon the work—the transactions—of his spies,
who may have gone to work as beggars with bowls and under other
disguises.—(153)

‘*Eight-fold business*’.—Either (A)—

1.  undertaking of what has not been done,
2.  the doing of what, has not been done,
3.  the refining of what has been done,
4.  the acquiring of the fruits of the act,
5.  conciliating,
6.  alienating,
7.  giving
8.  and employing force;

or (B)—

1.  Trade,
2.  building of embankments and bridges,
3.  fortification,
4.  repairing of fortifications,
5.  elephant-catching,
6.  mine-digging,
7.  colonising uninhabited places
8.  and clearing of forests.

Others quote the following two verses of Śukra, in explanation of what
constitutes the ‘eight-fold business’—“

1.  Acquiring,
2.  (and) spending,
3.  dismissing,
4.  (and) forbidding,
5.  propounding of the right course of conduct,
6.  investigating cases,
7.  inflicting punishments,
8.  and imposing purificatory penances;

—the king, ever intent upon these, is said to carry on his ‘eight-fold
business’; he who duly performs this eight-fold business is honoured by
his enemies and goes to heaven.

In this quotation—

1.  ‘acquiring’ means the receiving of revenues;
2.  ‘expenditure’ stands for gifts to servants;
3.  ‘dismissing’ for getting rid of wicked servants;
4.  ‘forbidding’ for the checking of the improper activities of his
    officers;
5.  ‘propounding of the right course of conduct’ for the checking of
    improper conduct;
6.  ‘investigation of cases’ for the settling of doubts arising in
    regard to the duties of the several castes and orders;
7.  ‘inflicting of punishment,’ for what is done in the case of disputes
    among his subjects;
8.  and ‘purificatory penances’ for those that have to be done in
    connection with mistakes due to want of care.

All this constitutes the ‘eight-fold business

‘*Five-fold group*’.—This stands for the five kinds of spies, disguised
as—

1.  a scholar,
2.  a fallen ascetic,
3.  a householder in distress,
4.  a merchant in trouble,
5.  and a hermit.

The term ‘scholar’ here stands for forward students advertising
themselves as knowing the highest law; the spy who goes about thus
disguised should be honoured by the minister with presents and marks of
honour, and addressed thus—‘Putting your trust upon the king and on
myself, you should report whatever wrong you happen to discover.’

\(2\) The ‘*fallen ascetic*’ is one who has fallen off from the state of
the true Renunciate; he is one who is endowed with intelligence and
purity; and he should take up service as a body-servant in a place where
there is plenty of gold and where there is every possibility of vast
gifts of food-grains being made; he shall also carry the fruits of
agriculture to all wandering mendicants, enough to supply them with
food, clothing and home; among these those that might be seeking a
livelihood, these he should alienate; and in this manner the work of his
employer, the king, should be done. Such a spy shall present himself at
the time of the distribution of fooding and wages; and all wandering
mendicants would, in this fashion, become alienated from their duties.

\(3\) ‘*The householder in distress*’,—is the agriculturist reduced to
poverty, who is clever and pure. He should do the work of cultivation on
a piece of land, such as described above.

\(4\) The ‘*merchant in trouble*’ is the trader, clever and pure, but
reduced to poverty; he should do the work of trading, in a place, such
as described above.

\(5\) The disguised ‘*ascetic*’ is one who is either completely shaven
or wears matted locks, and goes about seeking a living. He should take
up lodgings dose by the city, accompanied by a large number of
clean-shaven disciples, openly living upon a handful of herbs or
barley-corn, taken at the interval of thirty days, but secretly eating
to his heart’s content; his disciples, also disguised as ascetics, shall
proclaim to the people that he is possessed of great occult powers, and
thereby obtain presents of money; and under his influence the king’s
confidential ministers would disclose to him projected burnings, danger
from thieves, the projected killing of wicked persons or news from
foreign countries,—saying ‘this will happen either to-day or tomorrow’,
‘the king is going to do this and that’, and so forth.

Under the other king there would be certain persons studying the science
of genealogy, the *Saṅgavidyā* (?), the science of putting to sleep
(*Jambhakavidya*?), the processes of magic, the duties of the several
orders, the science of omens; and all such persons the king shall get
over to his own kingdom through the above-mentioned five kinds of spies.
Among the ministers, priests, army commanders, princes, wardens, inner
guards and others belonging to the other king,—he shall, under the
disguise of ordinary citizens, introduce his own trusted ministers, who
are experts in tricks, disguises, arts and languages; similarly he shall
also depute the humpbacked, the dwarf, the forester, the dumb, the
idiot, the deaf, the blind, the actor, the dancer, the singer and
others, as also women capable of entering the harem; along the forests
foresters should be appointed, and in villages villagers, all ostensibly
engaged in their own business and wholly immersed in these; and all
these shall be in constant communication with persons of their own kind.
Similarly with persons capable of moving in water, who should go about
secretly, and hold secret commissions.

Having appointed this ‘five-fold group’, he shall, through these, learn
all about ‘affection and disaffection’ among the people of the other
king, as also among his own priests and ministers.

He shall also ponder over the ‘conduct of his circle’,—*i.e*., the
tendency to peace and war of his provincial governors.—(154)

undone, (6) Completing what is done, (7) Bettering what is completed,
(8) Consolidating the fruits of the operation;—(B) (1) Trading routes,
(2) Bridgemaking, (3) Fortification, (4) Strengthening of forts, (5)
Elephant-catching, (6) Mining, (7) Settling unpopulated tracts, and (8)
Clearing forests;—(C)—(1) Revenue-collection, (2) Expenditure, (3)
Dismissing undesirable servants, (4) Prohibiting of wrong, (5) Deciding
difficult points, (6) Inspection of judicial affairs, (7) Inflicting of
punishments, (8) prescribing purificatory penances.—Of these (B) is
adopted by Nandana, and (C) by Govindarājā, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 411), which
explains that the ‘eightfold business’ has been described by Uśanas, and
it quotes the verses cited by Medhātithi, to which it adds the note that
‘*śuddhi*’ is ‘expiatory penance.’ It proceeds to explain *pañcavarga*
as standing for (1) *kāpālika*, beggar (2) *dāmbhika*, the hypocrite,
(3) *gṛhapati*, the householder (4) *vaidehaka*, and (5) the disguised
hermit; it goes on to point out that it may stand for—(1) The
commencement of an operation, (2) the supply of men, (3) supply of
material, (4) precautionary measures and (5) success.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Kājanīti, p. 159), where also the
verses of Uśanas are quoted, to which the following explanatory notes
are added:—‘*Ādānam*’—*i*.*e*., of taxes and other dues,—‘*visarga*’,
‘making gifts of wealth,’—‘*praiṣa*’ is the activity of the Minister and
others relating to temporal and spiritual matters,—‘*niṣedhaḥ*’,
prohibiting of inimical acts,—‘*anuvacana*’, ‘the king’s orders
regarding doubtful points’—and ‘*śuddhi*’ is ‘expiatory penance.’—it
explains ‘*pañcavarga*’ as consisting of—(1) allies, (2) means of
success, (3) apportionment of time and place, (4) prevention of trouble
and (5) success.

It is quoted again in the same work, on page 317, where also the same
verses from Uśanas are quoted, but with a fuller explanatory
note:—‘*Ādānam*’ is ‘collection of revenue and other dues’,—‘*visarga*’
is ‘the giving away of prizes and other presents’,—‘*preṣa*’ is the
deputing of servants (v.l. *praiṣa*) and others,—‘*arthavacana*’ is
‘taking of measures for amassing wealth’,—some works read, for
‘*arthavacanam*’, ‘*anuvacanam*’, which means ‘the king’s orders on
doubtful points’,—‘*śuddhi*’ regarding Punishments, consists in their
being inflicted in accordance with law; and that regarding the ‘Self’
consists in expiatory penances.—Next it quotes Medhātithi’s first
explanation (A) of the ‘eightfold business and then proceeds to explain
‘*pañcavarga*’ (of the text) as meaning the ‘group consisting of five
spies’, as follows:—(1) Those trustworthy persons who are experts in
geography, arts, languages and so forth, (2) those disguised as dwarfs,
foresters, dumb and deaf, insane or blind, (3) dancers, musicians, and
singers, (4) Ascetics and so forth. It then quotes the other explanation
of ‘*pañcavarga*’ as consisting of allies and the rest (see above).
‘*Aparāgaḥ*’ (of the text) means ‘disaffection’; the sense being that
the king should make it his business to learn everything regarding the
affection and disaffection that there may be among Ministers, Priests,
the Commander-in-Chief, the Heir Apparent, the Porter and others.

*Pracetas* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 159).—‘Acquiring, spending,
directing, forbidding, proclaiming, investigating suits, punishing and
expiating,—are the eight functions of the king; by fulfilling these
eight functions the king goes to Heaven and is honoured by
Indra.—Assistants, means of accomplishment, division of place, division
of time, and remedy for troubles,—these are the five elements of
success.’

*Uśanas* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 411).—(Same as above.)

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 75).—‘The five subjects for consultation are—(1) the
means of commencing operations, (2) the supply of requisite men and

Of the said ‘circle’ the following are the four principal components—(1)
the King bent upon conquest, (2) the Enemy, (3) the Intermediary and (4)
the Neutral. Of these the King, who has people on his side and who has
made up his mind to conquer a certain part of the world, is called ‘bent
upon conquest,’ by reason of his being endowed with courage and
strength.—the ‘Enemy’ is of three kinds—(*a*) born, (*b*) natural and
(*c*) acquired.—The ‘Intermediary’ is the king whose territory is
co-terminous with that of the king in question.—The ‘Neutral’ is one who
is capable of defeating each of the two—‘one who is bent upon conquest’
and his ‘enemy’—singly, but not con jointly; and also each of the
three—‘he who is bent upon conquest,’ the ‘enemy’ and the
‘intermediary’—singly, but not conjointly.—(I55)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 320), which adds
the following notes:—In the ‘circle’ of kings, there are four kinds of
kings—(1) The king seeking conquest (2) the three kinds of enemy—the
natural enemy, the artificial enemy and the neighbouring state, (3) the
middle state, which is capable of defeating either of the two parties to
a conflict, taken singly (4) the neutral, who is capable of smashing any
one of the above three.

**(verses 7.155-159)  
**

*Śukranīti* (1.121). The kingdom is an organism of seven limbs—the King,
the Minister, the Ally, the Treasure, the Kingdom, the Fort and the
Army.’

Do. (2.141-113).—‘The Priest, the Viceroy, the Premier, the Commander,
the Councillor, the Judge, the Scholar, the Finance Minister and the
ordinary Minister and the Spy, these are the ten limbs of the King.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.38).—‘Towards his neighbour and natural enemy, his ally, a
neutral power, and a power situated in between his natural enemy and an
oppressive power,—let him adopt alternately, as the occasion and the
time require, the four modes of obtaining success—Conciliation,
Division, Presents and Force.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.344).—‘The enemy, the ally, the neutral power, and
those coming in between these,—all these he shall deal with through
conciliation and other methods. These methods are Conciliation,
Presents, Division and Force.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara*—(Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 319).—‘The king shall he
careful with regard to the seven-limbed kingdom; the *seven limbs* being
Conciliation, Presents, Fortification, Treasury, Fines, Ally and
People.’—He shall banish all persons obstructing these seven, and he
shall (quickly destroy all his enemies.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do., p. 322).—‘The king himself seeking glory, has to
d«al with the following—Enemy, Ally, Enemy’s Ally, Ally’s ally, Ally of
the enemy’s ally;—these in front; then come the following in the
rear—one attacking in the rear, one restraining this rear-attack, those
helping the rear-attack, and those helping the restrainer.’

*Arthaśāstra* (Part II, p. 224).—‘Master, Minister, People, Fort,
Treasury, Force and Allies are the seven Constituent Factors.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 175).—‘The Methods are Conciliation, Presents,
Division and Force. *Conciliation* is five-fold—describing virtues,
recalling mutual relationship, recalling mutual help, indicating future
possibilities, self-surrender.—*Describing of virtues* consists in
setting forth the nobility of birth, physical virtues, facts and so
forth.—*Recalling of relationship* consists in pointing out the blood
and other relationships;—*Recalling of Mutual Help* in reminding one of
the occasions on which help was rendered;—*Indicating of Future
Possibilities*, in pointing out that the acceptance of the proposal
would bring benefits;—*Self-surrender*, in ottering all one’s
resources—“whatever is mine is yours, you can make such use of it as you
like.”

*Śukranīti* (4.1.51, *et. seq*.)—‘Alliance, Presents, Division and
Force,—these policies are to be applied separately to the Friend,
Relatives, Family, Subjects and Enemies. “No one is such a friend as
yourself”—this is called *Alliance*.—“ All my goods, even my life, are
yours”—this is *Present*.—The narrative of one’s own merits or those of
other friends to somebody is *Division.-*—“If you do such and such an
act, I shall cease to be your friend”—this is *Force*............ The
statesmanlike King shall employ these policies in such a wav that
friends, neutrals and foes can never go beyond himself.—*Sāma*, Peace,
is to be employed first,—then Presents,—then the playing off of enemies
against one another. Force is to be employed only when actual danger
threatens. Alliance and Presents are to be employed towards forceful
enemies; Alliance and Division towards those superior in strength;
Division and Force towards equals and pure Force is advisable only
against an enemy who is powerless.—Towards friends, only Alliance and
Presents are to be employed;—never Division or Force.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.16).—‘King, Minister, Kingdom, Caste, Treasury, Army and
Allies are known to form the seven constituents of government; good
sense and unebbing energy are its primary stay.’

Do. (4.1-2).—‘The King, Minister, Kingdom, Fort, Treasury, Army and
Allies form the seven constituents of the state. They contribute to
one-another’s weal, and the loss of even a single one of these renders
the whole imperfect; he who wishes to keep the state perfect should
study their nature.’

Do. (8.4, 5).—‘Minister, Fort, Kingdom, Treasury and Army,—have been
declared to be the five constituents of the central sovereign.—These
five and the allied sovereigns, and in the seventh place, the central
monarch himself, have been said by Bṛhaspati to compose what is known as
the “seven-limbed state.”

*Kāmandaka* (8.16).—‘*Ari*, *Mitra*, *Arimitra*, *Mitrāmitra*, and the
*Arimitrāmitra* are the five sovereigns whose domains he consecutively
in front of the king going out on a conquering expedition.’

Do. (8.18).—‘The sovereign whose domain lies intervening between the
dominions of the *Ari* and the conquering king is denominated the
*Madhyama*. His attitude becomes friendly when the *Ari* and the
conquering king are united, and it is hostile to them when these are
disunited.’

Do. (8.25).—‘The twelve cardinal sovereigns, together with their
respective five *Prakṛtis*, constitute the *Prakṛtimaṇḍala* consisting
of seventy-two factors.’

Do. (8.36).—‘The six Prakṛtis, *viz*., Minister, Kingdom, Fort,
Treasury, Army and Ally,—of each of the ten sovereigns taken together,
compose what is designated the *maṇḍala of sixty factors*.’

Do. (8.70).—‘The king should please his own *Prakṛtis* by conciliation,
presents and bestowal of honour, and be should crush the *Prakṛtis* of
his enemies by sowing dissension among them and by openly attacking
them.’

Do. (14.1).—‘The *Prakṛtis*, from Minister to Ally, are the constituents
of the state. Of all the weaknesses of the state, the gravest is the
weakness of the king himself.’

Do. (15.22).—‘Internal disaffection should he allayed by such measures
of policy as conciliation, presents and the rest; and external
disaffection by the causing of dissension and disunion among the
disaffected party. A wise King should allay disaffection in such a
manner that the disaffected do not go over to the enemy.—The loss of men
and munition is said to be *destruction* and the loss of money and food
is said to be *drain*; the wise and prudent king should never have
recourse to a policy leading to such destruction and drain.’

Do. (15.55).—‘The king should wean over to his side, by means of
conciliation, presents and the rest, the foresters, frontier tribes, and
commanders of forts, whom he may come across *en route*. In difficult
and intricate tracts these people become the guide and point out the
way.’

*Kāmandaka* (17.3).—‘Conciliation, presents, display of military power
and dissension, these four, and also Deceit, Neglect and
Conjuring,—these seven in all are the means of success against an
enemy.’

Do. (I7.60-61).—‘The king conversant with the virtues of conciliation,
should employ it whenever he likes. At first he should employ the policy
of Presents, and then Conciliation and Dissension.—The policy of
Conciliation without the support of the policy of resents seldom brings
success in an undertaking; it cannot produce the desired eiīeet, even
when employed towards one’s own wife.’

One who is the immediate neighbour of the king bent on conquest shall be
regarded as his enemy; as also the enemy’s ally. Similarly he shall
regard as his friend the immediate neighbour of his enemy. The King who
is beyond these two is ‘*neutral*.’

Presents of gold and other things with a view to secure the good will of
both parties constitute ‘*alliance*’; and the opposite of this is
‘*War*’;—going forward with a single purpose is ‘*March*’;—ignoring of
the enemy leads to ‘*Halt*’;—putting forward terms of peace as well as
of war constitutes ‘*Bifurcation*’;—and the surrendering of oneself to
another is ‘*Seeking Shelter*’. These are the six ‘measures of policy’;
and from among these he shall have recourse to that one by means of
which, he feels, he would be enabled to erect fortifications, capture
elephants, dig mines, carry on trade, cut down forests, raise
embankments round fields in tracts not irrigated by rain, to win the
wealth of other people, and so forth.—(160)

**(verses 7.160-161)

*Viṣṇu* (3.39).—‘He shall resort, as the time demands, to the six
measures of making alliance and waging war, marching to battle and
halting, seeking shelter and help and distributing his forces.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.346).—‘He shall duly have recourse to alliance, war,
marching, sitting, seeking help and dividing his forces.’

*Arthaśāstra* (Part II, p. 237).—‘The circle of constituents forms the
source of the six Measures.—The six Measures are Alliance, War, Halting,
Marching, Seeking Shelter and Duplicity—say the Teachers. According to
Vātavyādhi, there are only two measures, all the six being included
under Alliance and War. Alliance consists in entering into treaty; War
in inflicting injury; Halting in disregarding; Marching in rising
against the enemy; Seeking Shelter in surrendering oneself to another;
and Duplicity in planning both peace and war.’

*Śukranīti* (4.7. 464, *et.seq*.).—‘The six constituents of state-craft
are—*Sandhi*, *Vigraha*, *Yāna*, *Āsana*, *Āśraya* and
*Dvaidhībhāva*;—*Sandhi*, Peace, is that by which a powerful enemy
becomes friendly;—*Vigraha*, War, is that by which the enemy is pressed
and subdued;—*Yāna* is marching for the furtherance of one’s own
interests and the destruction of the enemy’s;—*Āsana*, Entrenching, is
that step by which one protects himself but destroys the
enemy;—*Āśraya*, Seeking shelter, is that whereby even the weak becomes
strong;—*Dvaidhībhāva* is the stationing of one’s troops in several
directions.’

*Kāmandaka* (11.1).—‘There are six modes of foreign Policy—according to
some only two—Peace (including Duplicity and Shelter) and War (including
Marching and Halting).

undertaken for helping an ally attacked by an enemy;—‘Marching’ also is
of two kinds—(1) singly, and (2) conjointly with an ally; ‘Halting’ also
is of two kinds—(1) done on account of weakness and (2) done for the
purpose of waiting to help an ally;—‘Division of forces’ is of two
kinds—(1) the king remaining with half the force in the fort and the
Commander-in-chief going out to meet the enemy and (2) the reverse
arrangement;—‘Seeking protection’ also is of two kinds—(1) done for the
rescuing of what has been lost and (2) done for awaiting future

illustrious, well-spoken, benevolent, learned, even-minded, having
numerous partisans and expected to remain constant in faithfulness at
all times. Friends are of four kinds—derived from birth, relationship,
ancestral obligations and protection from danger.’

**(verse 7.163)**

*Kāmandaka* (9.5, etc.).—‘Peace concluded between two parties of equal
resources is called *Kapāla-sandhi*. The peace concluded through the
offer of presents is called *Upahāra*. *Santāna-sandhi* is that
concluded by the king by giving his daughter in marriage to his royal
adversary. That peace is called *Saṅgata-sandhi* which is founded on
friendship; this is also called *Kāñcana*. Peace that is concluded with
a view to putting a stop to all outstanding controversies has been named

*Upanyāsa*. “If I do him good, he will do the same to me.”—Peace

The ‘season’ for the king himself declaring war is that time when he is
full of confidence in his own strength and is imbued with courage for
reducing his enemy, when his subjects are united and prosperous, fully
endowed with the rewards of agriculture and other kinds of business, and
ready to deprive the enemy of all this business,—and when the enemy’s
subjects are in reduced circumstances and covetous, and as such easily
capable of being alienated from him and won over to the other side,—this
is the ‘season’ for war to be waged by the king himself. And it is ‘out
of season’ when conditions are the reverse of this.

Further, war is also waged, by reason of some wrong inflicted on one’s
ally. If the enemy has done some injury to his ally, then, taking this
into consideration, the king shall wage war, even though it be out of
season. Though he himself may be an ally of the injured king only in the
sense that he is the neighbour of the king who has inflicted the wrong
(and from whom he himself might expert an attack), yet, with the help of
the ally (whose injury he is going to avenge) he would be able to check
that enemy. It is true that the enemy’s neighbour is his ally; but the
enemy’s enemy has his realm further removed.

Another reading is ‘*mitreṇa caivāpdkṛte*’; which means that if the king
happens to be attacked by his ally, he may wage this war even out of
season.

The two kinds of war thus are—(l) that waged for one’s own sake, and (2)
that waged for the sake of the ally; or one kind of war is that which is
prompted by one’s own prosperity, and another kind is that which is
waged when one has been wronged by his ally and is on that account, in
trouble.—(164)

The two-foldness of Marching is based upon its being undertaken by the
king alone by himself or accompanied by his ally. The king can march
alone by himself only when he has the requisite strength; otherwise he
can march only when accompanied by his ally.

‘*Emergent occasion*’; *e.g*., when some trouble befalls the enemy, he
becomes the fittest object of attack at that same moment; otherwise, if
time is allowed to lapse, he would recover his strength and thus become
difficult to destroy.—(165)

Halting has been declared to be of two kinds:—(1) that which is necessary for one who has become gradually weakened, either by chance or through previous acts, and (2) that which is necessitated by considerations for his ally.—(166)

‘Halting’ means the *withdrawing of oneself*. This also is of two
kinds—(1) When the king is “*weakened*’—in force and in money,—even
though he be prosperous, he has to ignore bis enemy; and another kind of
Halting is that which is done in consideration of the ally. If the
relations of his ally, who is weak, with the enemy is not such as to
make it safe for his ally to rise against that enemy,—then, in
consideration of the delicate position of his ally, the king should
‘*halt*’.

The said ‘*weakness*’ arises from two causes:—it may be due to
‘*chance*’ or to ‘*former acts*’. This only describes the actual state
of things. The strength and weakness of all kings are due to these two
causes. ‘*Chance*’ here stands for the man⁹s want of care, *e.g*.,
extravagance, inalertness regarding the army and so forth; and ‘*former
acts*’ means the demerit caused by evil deeds in the past. Or the
explanation of the two terms may be reversed (‘former acts’ standing for
*carelessness*, and ‘chance’ for *past misdeeds*).

‘*Mohāt*’ (‘through folly’) is another reading (for ‘*daivāt*’, ‘*by
chance*’); but what is meant is expressed by the term ‘*daiva*’,—(166)

When different positions are taken up by the Master and his Army,—the
Master, with a small force, remains in the fort, while the Commander,
with a larger force proceeds elsewhere. Or, some sort of ‘bifurcation’
is resorted to by way of favouring the different divisions, in the way
of allowing all the divisions opportunities for securing booties of gold
and other things.

*Objection*.—“The measure here described is *Bifurcation*; and of this
there cun be only one form—different positions being taken up by the
Master and his Forces. There is no reason why any other kind of division
should be mentioned; the only bifurcation that need be mentioned is that
consisting in different positions being taken up by the Master and his
Forces.”

The answer to this is that it is by implication that we get at the other
two kinds of ‘bifurcation’—(1) one being that which is done for one’s
own sake and (2) that done for the sake of others.—(167)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“The text really mentions only one method of ‘Division.’ Hence
Medhātithi thinks that, in order to obtain the two kinds required, it
must be understood that the measure may be resorted to either for one’s
sake or for the sake of somebody else.—Nārāyaṇa makes the two methods
out by supposing that in the one case the army stops in front of the
enemy under the command of a general, while the king marches with a
portion of his forces, and that in the other case the contrary takes
place.—Govindarāja quotes Kāmandaki, 11.24, where a different meaning,
‘duplicity’ is attributed to the term ‘*dvaidhībhāva*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 326) which
explains ‘*sthitiḥ*’ as ‘*dvidhābhūya sthitiḥ*’ ‘taking up a position
with forces divided,’ and adopts the explanation attributed (in the
above note) to Nārāyaṇa;—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 24b).

When a king is harassed by bis enemies, he seeks shelter, for the
purpose of accomplishing some useful purpose.

The ‘purpose’ to be served is the ceasing of the harassment; and for the
attaining of this purpose one should seek shelter with a powerful
supporter; *e.g*. giving up his own territory he should go over to the
realms of that supporter.

‘*Status*’.—Even though not actually harassed, he shall seek shelter
with another king for the purpose of acquiring a status; that would save
him from future harassment. The advantage that is secured is that he
acquires a status in the eyes of men who realise that ‘he has got such
and such a king for his protector, and hence cannot be harassed by
others’. The ‘seeking shelter’ for the purpose of acquiring status has
been called ‘status’, by regarding the two as co-ordinate.

‘*Vyapadeśārtham*’ is another reading, (‘for the purpose of acquiring
status’).

In answer to the question—With whom should he seek shelter?—the text has
added—‘*with noble people*’. Shelter should be sought with one of those
kings that are noble, at whose hands no ill-treatment could be feared.
The term ‘*noble*’ connotes such qualities as *capacity to protect
others from harassment*, and so forth.—(168)

*Kāmandaka* (9.33).—‘The king whose *Prakṛtis* are disaffected is
deserted by them at the prospect of war; and he who is excessively
addicted to sensual pleasures becomes so weak as to be easily crushed.’

*Kāmandaka* (15.3).—‘When a king feels sure of his ability to forcibly
slay his foe, even though swelling with power,—then alone should he
start on a military expedition, inflicting injuries on the latter.’

Do. (15.19).—‘Of internal and external defects, the internal is the
graver. Amending the internal defects and providing necessary measures
for the removal of the external ones, the king shall set out on the
expedition.’

his shelter.

And such a king shall he served like a preceptor; and in so doing the
king shall not consider his dignity at all; he should have no such
notion as ‘he also is a great king, so I shall treat him as my equal’;
in fact he shall be attended upon, like a master.

If even in that seeking of refuge he should
‘*perceive*’—feel—‘*something wrong on the part of his shelterer*’; &c.
&c. The signs indicating such ‘wrong’ are the following:—

‘Repentance after having given the shelter, *Kṛtapurvahomam* (?),
showing disrespect, describing misdeeds, inattention, disagreeable
speech,—these are the acts of the unfavourable man,

Thus when the shelterer is found to be unfavourably inclined,—although
the shelterer be, in reality, free from anything actually wrong,—this is
what is implied by the term ‘*api*’, ‘*even*—at such a time he shall,
without any hesitation, have recourse to war. Nor is it necessary that
the man should suffer destruction after having been reduced to a
condition necessitating his taking shelter; because even a stronger man
is sometimes found to be defeated by the weaker. In any case, the final
result is bound to be favourable: if he wins, he regains his kingdom, if
he is defeated, he is sure to attain heaven. We are going to show later
on the excellence of war.

instance, us the formation of cliques and the like.

‘*Act in such a manner*’—try to manage his affairs in such a way.

‘*Politic*’—well versed in the science of government, naturally
possessed of keen intelligence, as also conversant with the art of
politics.

‘*Superior*’—in the three elements of strength;—so that his allies and
others may not be so, he shall act in all things,—in the undertakings of
his people—in such a way as to make himself greater than all of them.

In view of metrical exigencies the author has omitted to mention the
‘intermediary’. But he also is to be watched, and not ignored, because
friendly. There is no such thing as a ‘friend’, without some motive of
his own; in fact when a friend becomes great, he also, for some purpose
of his own, becomes an enemy; as says Vyāsa—‘No one is anybody’s friend,
nor is any body any body’s enemy; friends and enemies are to be regarded
as such only in accordance with the powers that they possess.’

By means of these expedients, the king shall deliberate upon his. whole
circle.—(177)

‘*Undertakings*’— Business affairs. When any work is going to be
undertaken, he shall consider its ‘*future*’—*i.e*., its developments to
come,—and also its ‘*present condition*’,—*i.e*., its condition at the
beginning,—‘*fully*’— in all its real details. As a matter of fact,
undertakings have several offshoots, and undergo transformation in a
moment; so that if both ends (future and present) of an undertaking are
not dearly grasped, it is difficult to ascertain in what manner it shall
be proceeded with; hence the necessity of consi d eration, which the
present text enjoins.

‘*Also the good and bad points of all past ones*’—shall then be pondered
over. Here also having thought over the good and bad points of past
actions, one has to make up his mind to undertake first those which are
found to have only good points; and brain lies the use of thinking over
the good and bed points of past acts,—which are enjoined in the present

Thus if a king knows the good and bad points of an act, likely to appear
in the future, he would act with deliberation; and would undertake only
such acts as are likely to develop good points, and avoid those likely
to lead to evil. It is for this reason that the knowledge of the likely
developments of an undertaking is necessary.

‘*Relating to the present*’;—he who takes quick decisions, and does not
delay their execution, is said to be ‘*quick in his decisions*’; such a
person is quick to act, and does what leads to good, and not what leads
to evil:

‘*In the past*’;—when an act has been done, if the man judges the act by
ite end only, he becomes great by reason of his undertaking only such
acts as lead to good;—and he is ‘*never overpowered by his enemies*’.

As a matter of fact, it is not possible for the Six measures of Policy
to be dealt with in detail in a work dealing with *Dharma*; hence the
subject has been treated of only briefly.—(179)

When he is going to undertake an expedition involving a campaign that
might be a long one, in consideration of his own forces and also in that
of the king against whom he is marching,—he shall march against the
hostile kingdom in the month of *Mārgaśīrṣa*, when his forces are fully
equipped and when his stores are fully replenished with the
autumn-harvest. Starting about this time, he can easily carry with him
the autumn-fruits garnered in the house and is cheered by the prospects
of the spring-harvest. The time is quite fit for the work of laying
siege to fortresses and to forth; and the path also is not beset with
deviations and diversion due to the overgrowth of grasses or the
over-flowing of risers; and the season is neither too hot nor too cold.
At any other time of the year food-grains, even though sufficient,
cannot be of sufficiently diverse quality, the season of the three
harvests being far off; so that the enemy would be likely to take
shelter under a powerful king, which would lead to the unnecessary
expenditure of the stock of food-grains of both parties, and the
attacking king’s own forces also would become weakened.

If however the king is desirous only of inflicting some injury on the
enemy’s territory, or when the expedition is expected to take a short
time, and his force is sufficiently strong, then he may start also
during the months of *Phālguṇa* and *Caitra*, specially against a
country which is rich in spring-harvests. At this time of the year also,
he can obtain fodder and at the same time inflict an injury upon the
other party, by destroying the crops standing in the fields.

‘*According to the condition of his forces*’;—he should regulate his
marches according to the strength of his army.—(182)

*Kāmandaka* (15.35).—‘The best season for the marching out of elephants

Even apart from the seasons mentioned in the preceding verse, ‘*at other

victory is ‘*certain*’—sure to come—then ‘*he shall march forward*’—if
he has a strong force, during the rains,—has his elephants and horses in

‘*Trouble*’ for the enemy, in connection with his army and treasury &c.
when such trouble has arisen, then he may march against him, even
irrespectively of the condition of his own forces; since the army,
suffering from its own internal troubles, becomes easily reducible; in
fact he perishes, even like a log of wood which perishes by the mere

**(verses 7.184-185)**

‘*At the base*’—in his own kingdom and in his own fort—he shall
establish a rear-guard by way of ‘*arrangement*’ *i.e*., as a
precautionary measure; that is, he shall supply the fort with a large
supply of food-grains &c. and with fitted up machines and defences and
ditches &c. The kingdom also he shall leave protected by companies of
soldiers. Having made the Commander thoroughly contented by means of
honours and presents, he shall appoint him in charge of outposts in his
rear along the boundaries of his territory; and a fully-equipped army
shall be left under him, within his own territories.

‘*Those pertaining to the expedition*’—*i.e*., the preparations for the
expedition, consisting in providing weapons of offence and defence for
the elephant—corps, the cavalry and other branches of the army.

‘*Duly*’—*i.e*. according to the instructions contained in works dealing
with the art of war.

‘*Basis*’—f oot-hold; from where the temper of the people other than his
enemies might be duly watched;—having ‘secured’—made his own—such a
ground.

For the purpose of learning the condition of things in the enemy’s
kingdom, having ‘*deputed*’— appointed—spies; for the purpose of finding
out whether the enemy has began to get together his forces, or to rouse
his opponent’s circle to rebellion, or to take shelter with a neutral or
indifferent king; and he should also seek to ascertain whether the enemy
is going to check his very first advance directly, or to cut off his
communications, and all other allied matters.—(184)

‘*Three kinds of roads*’—*i.e*., those passing (1) through the open
country, (2) through marshy ground, and (3) through forests. Some people
read ‘*vana*’ is place of ‘*āṭavika*’, and thus make up the ‘three’.
Others again describe the ‘*three kinds of roads*’ as (1) high, (2) low
and (3) level.

‘*Having cleared*’; — cutting off the trees, thickets and creepers
obstructing the path, and levelling the undulations of the ground,
preparing fords in rivers and ravines, destroying the wild animals
besetting the path, winning over the path-finders to his side, and
getting together supplies of food and fodder &c.

‘*Six-fold force*’— according to some the six factors are—(l) Elephants,
(2) horses, (3) chariots and (4) footsoldiers—these four constituting
the ‘army’—and (5) Treasury and (6) Mechanics. Others read ‘fixing of
rates’ in place of ‘treasury’. According to others again, the six
factors are—(1) the hereditary soldiers of the king, (2) mercenaries,
(3) groups, (4) friendly (5) unfriendly and (6) foresters.

‘*In the manner prescribed for warfare*’;—‘*Sāmparāyikam*’ means
*pertaining to* ‘*samparaya*’ or *tear*;—*i.e*., that which has been
laid down for the purpose of war; in that manner,—*i.e*., in the manner
prescribed for advancing against a fort,—he shall advance against the
enemy.

The disposition of the army shall be in accordance with the nature of
the ground; palisades being set of with dry or living pillars, with
several openings, and made of sticks, planks and branches of trees and
so forth. Special care has to be taken regarding this daring the time
that the army is on the march.—(185)

**(verse 7.184)**

‘*Upagṛhyāspadam*’—‘Having won over the disaffected servants of the
enemy’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘having established a
camp in the enemy’s country’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 396), which adds the following
notes—‘*mūle*’, ‘at the base, in his own kingdom’—‘*vidhānam*’,
‘measures for defending, such as garrisoning and so forth.’

**(verse 7.185)**

‘*Ṣaḍvidham balam*’—‘(1) Elephants, (2) horses, (3) chariots, (4)
foot-soldiers, (5) army-treasury, (6) labourers; or (1) the *maula* (2)
*bhṛtya*, (3) *śreṇī*, (4) *mitra*, (5) *amitra* and (6) *āṭavika*;
(Medhātithi);—the latter enumeration is found in Kāmandaka, 16.6, which
is adopted by Nandana.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 396), which explains ‘*ṣaḍvidham balam*’
as consisting of the *maula*, the *bhṛtaka* and so forth,’—and
‘*Sāmparāyikakalpena*’ as ‘in accordance with the rules of war’.

‘Who is serving his enemy secretly,’—hidden;—against such an ‘*ally*’,
as also against ‘*one who has gone away and returned*’—‘*he shall be
very much on guard*; he shall be careful, watchful, in regard to them;
*i.e*. he shall not trust them. Because such a person is ‘*the more
dangerous enemy*’—worse than one who is openly hostile to him.

The use of the epithets ‘*very much on guard*’ and ‘*more dangerous*’
implies that the person who has gone over to the other side and returned
again should not be received back.

Such a person is of four kinds:—(1) He who has gone away for some
reason, and comes back for some reason contrary to the reason for which
he had gone, e.g. he went away on account of some defect in his chief,
and comes back on having thought of his good qualities; (2) he who has
come back for some reason; from among these the person who comes back
for some reason shall be dismissed, as being fickle-minded and careless
in his acts, and hence no confidence can be reposed in him;—(3) he who
has gone for some reason, and returns also for the same reason; *e.g*.
he goes on account of some bad quality of his chief, and returns also on
account of some bad quality in his new chief; such a person shall be
received with honour, and if his return is found to be due to his
attachment to the former chief, he shall be taken back; (4) on the other
hand, if he be found to have been deputed by the enemy of his chief with
a view to cause some injury to his former chief, then he shall not be
taken back.—(186)

When the army is arranged in the shape of a staff, it is said to be
‘*arrayed in the form of* a *staff*’; similarly when in the shape of the
cart, it is ‘arrayed in the *form of a cart*’; and so on with the rest.

\(A\) In the fore-front, there is the Commander of the entire
force,—then the king in the centre,—then the army-commander,—on his two
flinks, the elephants,—close to them the horses,—then the footsoldiers;
the whole of this army being, like the staff and operating in a straight
line.

\(B\) Operating on both sides is the ‘*needle-array*’, in which the
soldiers operate in a solid mass, the bravest being in the forefront; it
constitutes a very much-lengthened line, all operating simultaneously.

\(C\) The ‘*alligator-array*’ is broad at the front face and at the two
flanks (thighs), and highly recommended; as nowhere in this array is
there any weak point; and even when pressed by braver enemies, it leads
to the breaking up of the enemy’s forces; and in the end its purpose is
entirely and surely accomplished. The rest of the army is to be thrown
into the middle of the array.

The above-mentioned dispositions of the army ore to by resorted to in
accordance with the end in view; on even ground the advance should be
made either in the ‘staff’ or the ‘needle’ or the ‘*garuḍa*’ array; but
on uneven ground, and on ground beset with obstructions, etc. that of
the ‘cart’ or the ‘alligator’ or the ‘boar’.—(187)

The ‘*Commander-in-Chief*’, the controller of the entire force and its
supplies, and the ‘*General*’—each of these being one only, and not
many, it would be impossible to station them ‘*in all directions*’;
hence the two names should be taken as standing for the subordinates of
the two officers; and when their subordinates have been stationed and
put in charge of all directions, the two officers themselves become so
‘stationed.’

Thus having stationed them in battle-array, with distinct
army-corps—each consisting of elephants and horses—alloted to each of
them, and having placed a mountain or a ditch in his rear, kept in
charge of a separate officer,—he shall regard that direction as the
‘East’ or ‘front’ from where he apprehends danger. In this manner he
shall arrange his camp, prepared to march forward, in the manner ot
learned men moving forward.—(189)

‘*Pickets*’—troops of men; some of them supplied with conches and drums,
while others are not so supplied. These shall be stationed at those
points where if any mishap were to occur, it would lead to grave peril.

The qualifications of these men are now stated—

(*a*) ‘*Reliable*’; ‘*āpta*’ is a *relative*, and ‘reliable servants’
are as good as relatives.

(*b*) ‘*With whom signals have been arranged*.’—with whom signs for
communication have been fixed upon; such as—‘when the battle has begun,
when you hear the sound of conches, trumpets, drums and other
instruments, in such and such a way, then you shall understand that
there are signs of wavering and retreat, and then you shall do such and
such an act’,—or ‘when the flag is taken down, or hoisted up, you shall
stand apart from one another; if it is hoisted in this way you shall
charge in a mass; you shall turn back, when it is raised in such and
such fashion’.

(*c*) ‘*Experts in standing* *firm*’,—who are determined to stand
together in proper formation even when charged by the canons of the
enemy attacking them in dense masses; ‘*as also in charging*’—*i.e*.,
while not quite expert in pursuing the fleeing enemy, they are adepts in
charging *en masse* into the thickest of the enemy and engaging in
fierce combat his rear-guard and taking captives hundreds of those
trying to run away.

(*d*) ‘*Fearless*’—hence prone to spreading themselves and yet operating
in combination.

(*e*) ‘*Loyal*’—identifying themselves entirely with the interests of
their chief.

In this fashion he shall establish several pickets ‘*on all
sides*’—*i.e*. on three sides—extending to two miles each way; bat the
position of these shall be altered everyday. When the fears of the chief
are allayed by the alertness of these, his people gain confidence in
him. And the king shall address the following words to his men—‘In as
much as, at the end of the war, presents, honours and appreciations
shall be distributed among all, it is the interest of all of you, along
with the ministers, that it be waged in the proper manner,—I am *king*
only in name—in reality all of us are equal sharers in all prosperity
that may come to us,—if we win, we acquire a kingdom, and if we lose we
attain heaven,—it is with this view that all of us have come
together’.—(190)

If the men do not fight in a close formation, and extend themselves over
a large space,—then, happening to be opposed by a larger force, they are
apt to be overtaken in small detachments and thus, by sheer impact,
become annihilated. For this reason, when the number of.men is small,
they should, be mode to fight in close formation, so that fighting with
mutual support, they do not become completely annihilated; and also when
fighting dose by one another, through mutual rivalry and attachment they
are enabled to fight the stronger enemy.

‘*As he likes*’—as much as he may wish, in view of the end to be
served,—‘*he may extend a large number of* wirn’—*i.e*., make them fight
in small detachments.

If the king thinks that when ordered to fight in small detachments, they
may be struck with fear,—or that fear might arise in their minds on
seeing the larger numbers of the enemy—then he shall array his men in
the form of the ‘*needle*’ described above. The ‘thunderbolt array’ is
that particular form in which the men are divided into three parts—one
in the front, another in the rear and the rest on the two sides (of the
king). In this ‘needle-array’ or ‘thunderbolt-array’ having arrayed his
men, he shall make them do buttle. Of all arrays these two have been
singled out for mention, as these two are best able to sustain a charge
as well as to push home an attack. When he finds these same formations
on the enemy’s side, then he shall resort to the opposite formation.

In the event of both belligerents being equal in number, the particular
formations and their effectiveness shall depend upon the physical
strength, loyalty and efficiency of the men engaged.

The term ‘*shall make to fight*’ implies that the king himself shall
direct the operations from his quarters in a fortress or in some other
comparatively safe spot forming the rear of the army. Says a work on the
subject—‘The king shall go back to a distance of 200 *bows* (1200 feet)
and stay there as the he engage in battle *rear guard*, for the purpose
of rallying the men that may be routed; and in no case shall he be
without such a rearguard’.—(191)

On even ground, he shall fight with chariots and horses; as there is no
obstruction for them on such ground,

‘*Marshy ground*’—ground abounding in water. On such ground, if the
water is shallow, he shall fight with elephants, but with boats, if it
is deep; these can move easily on such ground.

On ground convered with trees and thickets, with bows. This includes
also such ground as is cut up with pits and ditches;—the effect of these
being the same as that of trees etc.

‘*Firm ground?*— ground free from stones, trees, creepers, pits and the
like; on such ground he shall fight with swords and such other weapons
us are held in the hand—such as the lance; since these can be used in
fighting at close quarters, which shows the fighting-capacity of the

From among the people of other countries those have to be similarly

long breaths. Those that are ‘*light*’ are fearless, on account of being

‘*Having arrayed his forces*,’ and thereby displayed his strength, he
shall encourage his men with such words as—‘what is there to win? Our
enemies are already as good as defeated by your prowess,’—‘If you win
you gain much wealth, and thereby bring happiness to your dependents and
others; it you are slain in battle, you gain heaven, and pay off the
debt owing to your employer; on the other hand, if you are defeated, you
lose all these three advantages;’ and so forth, addressing them such
words as may be suitable to the occasion.

He shall also ‘*thoroughly test them*’; he shall get some one to address
them such words as—‘Do not submit to the restrictions laid down by the
king,—we could bear all these if the king and the commander exposed
themselves and their relations also to the same danger as ourselves,—the
king under the pretence of keeping the rear-guard, is keeping himself in
a safe place; being a coward he does not wish to enter the fray’ and so
forth. On hearing all this some of the men would reply as follows:—‘It
is not as you say,—this war is our very own,—and for us, who live by the
use of weapons, being killed in battle is a highly desirable end,—not
fleeing from battle is the highest duty of warriors, and the abandoning
of our duty would be a source of sin,—the king also should be guarded by
all means in our power;—when we are done, he shall certainly provide
rest and other favours for us,—in fact, that is why he is staying with
us’;—those who respond thus he shall treat with special consideration.
When they gain a victory, they should be enlogised (eulogised?) and
presented with robes of honour, and their attachment should be
strengthened by means of embraces, decorations and presents.

While they are engaging the enemy, ‘*he shall mart their behaviour*’;
*i.e*., find out how his men are behaving and how his treasury is
faring. Some men are likely to be half-hearted, while others go to it
whole-heartedly,—all this has to be carefully watched, on account of
human nature being extremely fickle; and even those who help generally
do so for some selfish end.

Having tested his men, he shall place the unreliable ones in the midst
of reliable ones, so that they may all reach the enemy’s
stronghold.—(194)

The author proceeds to lay down the means of getting at the enemy’s
stronghold in the next verse.

‘destroyed’ by its source of supply being cut off by means of
embankments. The *wall is* ‘destroyed’ by being breached by means of
machines, or being undermined. the ‘*ditch*’ is ‘destroyed’ either by
being filled up or by having an outlet made in its banks.

He shall *assail the enemy*, in the fort, at the breaches in the walls,

‘*Those who are alienable*’—*i.e*. such members of his family as are
angry with the enemy, and desirous of obtaining bis Kingdom;—all such
‘*he shall alienate*’; *i.e*. instruct them as to what they should do.
The act of ‘alienating’ consists in estranging the dependent from his
chief and inciting him to seek his own advantage at the cost of the
latter.

Through his spies he shall also keep himself informed of the ‘*enomy’s
doings*’,—to find out all that the beleagured enemy does in the way
inciting his own soldiers and foresters in his rear, and forming
alliances with the intermedearies and neutrals.

‘*When fate is propitious*’,—when it is favourable to the besieging
king; *i.e*., when the stars and planets bear a favourable aspect, when
dreams and other omens are found to be auspicious, and when there are
other signs visible, in the form of favourable winds and so forth,—then
being ‘*determined to conquer*’ and ‘*devoid of fear*,’ he shall march

Conciliation and the rest having failed,—even though victory be
uncertain, and equally possible for both combatants,—he shall fight in
such a manner that his victory become certain; and if he wins, he gains
a kingdom, while if he is slain, he gains heaven; so in either case
victory would be his. He shall not create imaginary difficulties, and he
shall also eschew all treacherous ways of fighting, as also all such
operations as would bring about either the utter annihilation of the
enemy or too much harassment. Says Vyāsa—‘O Arjuna, even Indra himself
dare not stand before men who have become desperate and given up all
hope of their lives’. When victory appears to be doubtful, retreat is
the proper thing to do; for when life has gone out, the man is unable to
accomplish his purpose; it is only while alive that he passes through
pleasing experiences, whereas if he dies, he only gains heaven.—(200).

After the enemy has been defeated and quiet has been restored in the
captured city, and among the people—‘he s hall worship *the gods and the
righteous Brāhmaṇas*’—*i.e*. those who perform all the acts that are
enjoined for the Brāhmaṇa, and who, as much as lies in their power,
avoid all that is forbidden. He shall make offerings of sandal-paint,
flowers, incense and so forth, with due apportionment and after proper
purification of the things offered.

‘*Grant remissions*’.—For the safety of householders, in order that
their livelihood may not suffer, he shall remit such portions of the
taxes as may be too burdensome for them, not realising them for one or
two years.

‘*Proclaim amnesties*’.—He shall make it known among the people of the
city and the villages—by means of the beat of drum or the felling of the
mace and such other means—that what they had done by virtue of their
loyalty to their former master had been forgiven and that henceforward
every one of them was free to take to his own calling.—(201).

If even after the bestowing of such fanours he finds that the citizens
and the people are still so loyal to their former master that they still
cherish feelings of attachment towards his dynasty, and that any
government of his own would not be lasting,—then, he shall do as
follows:—

‘*Parihāra*’—‘Exemptions from taxes and custom-dues etc.’
(Medhātithi);—‘gifts to the gods and Brāhmaṇas’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘gifts of clothes and ornaments to the inhabitants’
(Rāghavānanda).

“The term ‘*parihāra*’ occurs very frequently in the inscriptions (see
*e*. *g*., Arch. Reports of Western India, Vol. IV, p.104 *et*.
*seq*),and means ‘exemption from, taxes and payments as well as other
immunities’. These *parihāras* were regularly attached to all grants to
Brāhmaṇas or temples”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 403) in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 409), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Jitvā*,’ ‘having conquered the enemy’s territories’,—‘*devān
dhārmikān brāhmaṇān*’—*i*.*e*., those inhabiting the conquered
country—‘*sampūjayet*’,—‘he should worship’, *i*.*e*., ‘offer them
lands, gold, presents and honours’;—‘*parihārān*’ means ‘explanations of
his own action in conquering the country, such as it was not through
greed for conquest that I have conquered this kingdom, this king of
yours wronged me deeply, that is why I have conquered him—thereby
showing that he is not to blame;—or ‘*paṛhāra*’ may mean ‘gifts’, such
proclamations, for instance, as ‘all the gold and wealth that I have won
I present to the Brāhmaṇas’;—similary he should proclaim such amnesty as
‘all those who, through loyalty to their late king, acted against, me,
only did their duty, and they need not fear any retaliation from me’.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 73 a).

The non-giving of what should he given to the new king, or to any other
person, is ‘*productive of displeasure*’; it causes displeasure; and the
giving of it is ‘*productive of pleasure*’. Both these facts are well
known;—that the giving of what is desired causes pleasure, and the
witholding of it causes pain.

^(‘)*Each is commended when done at the proper time*’;—at one time any
gift however small causes pleasure, while at another time a poor gift,
or a small one, causes no pleasure at all. Hence the seizing and giving
away of property should be done after full consideration of the
peculiarity of the time,—(204).

‘*Undertaking*’, action done for the purpose of bringing about a
desirable result,—‘*all this*’ is dependent upon something.

‘*Vidhāna*’, ‘*ordering*’, is that which *ordains*, the effect of
actions. That which *ordains* an act also *qualifies* it;—‘*of Destiny
and of Human Exertion*’,—‘*Destiny*’ consisting in Merit &c., resulting
from previous acts, in the shape of doing what is prescribed and also
what is forbidden. The doing of an act has its motives noticeable in
morality or immorlity. *Says* the *Śṛuti*— “*Vidhi*, (creator)’ Vidhāna
(ordinance) *Niyati* (Destiny), *Svabhāva* (Nature), *Kāla* (Time),
*Brahma*, *Īśvara* (God,) *Karma* (Deed), *Daiva* (Fate), *Bhāgya*
(Luck), *Puṇya* (Merit) *Bhutāntaryoga* (co-operation of Beings)—these
are the synonyms of “*Previous Act*”;—and the *Smṛti* also “*Destiny*
should be understood as what is done by the man himself in his previous
body; and *Human Exertion* is what he does during this life”. From this
it is clear that as between ‘Destiny’ and ‘Human Exertion’, the latter
becomes, after death, the cause of the former.

It is on this ‘effect’ that every undertaking and its result are
‘dependent’. Destiny by itself, apart from Human Exertion, does not
bring about any results; it must need the help of Human Effort; and
Human Effort must need the help of Destiny. If results followed from
mere Destiny, independently of Human Exertion, then it would he possible
for results to accrue to the embryo also; since however there are no
such results, it has to be inferred that results follow from Destiny
only when it is accompanied by Human Exertion; similarly, if Human
Exertion were productive of results, independently by itself,; then all
kinds of results would accrue to all kinds of men. As a matter of fact,
no such thing ever actually happens. Hence it follows that causal
efficiency belongs to both conjointly. So says Vyāsa—‘All human
undertakings are the effects of twofold *Karma*,—Destiny and Human
Exertion; apart from these two there is nothing else.’ (*Mahābhārata*,
*Sauptika-parva*, 2.2); and in the *Samāna-tantra* (?) also—‘Destiny and
Human Exertion maintain the moral and immoral activities of men.’

Those who hold that Destiny is the sole cause of things argue as
follows:—“Destiny is the only cause. As a matter of fact, we find that
idiots, eunuchs, cripples, lame persons and others, though absolutely
unable to put forth any exertion, are still happy; though entirely
helpless, yet they obtain the good results of past acts. On the other
hand, it is often found that persons with enough means at their command,
able-bodied, brave and clever and versed in the scriptures, are unhappy,
even though putting forth all their efforts; and people go on
experiencing gains and losses, brought about Destiny alone,
independently of all efforts of their own. It is only under this theory
that all activities tending to bring about results in the other world
come to have their use; the idea in the mind of the actors being—‘we are
experiencing in this world the results of past deeds and in the other
world we shall experience those of our present deeds’; and it is when
they know this that they engage themselves in meritorious deeds, and it
is on this account that doubts also arise in the minds of people. (In
support of the fatalist’s stand-point) they quote the following
saying—‘I know what is righteous, and yet I do not act up to it; and I
know what is unrighteous, and yet I do not desist from it;; I do exactly
as I am prompted to do by God; apart from Him there is no other guide’.”

On the other hand, those who would depend entirely upon Human Exertion
argue, thus:—“Human Exertion is the sole cause of all activities. It is
only when the man laboriously exerts towards agricultural operations
that he obtains the fruits of cultivation in the shape of good harvest.
To this end it has been declared that—‘In this world, it is only one who
resorts to activity and performs acts that enjoys their results’. Even
when food is there, people do not have their hunger satisfied unless
they actually do the eating; so that it stands to reason that since the
result of the act of eating accrues to the man only after he has done
that act, it should be attributed to the act (and not to any thing
else). It is only thus that all injunctions regarding the doing of acts
become useful. To this end they say—‘The wise man sometimes sets aside
even Destiny itself, just as he keeps off heat and cold and brings on as
well as drives off rain.’”

From all these arguments it follows that causal efficiency belongs to
both, Destiny and Human Exertion; specially as it is found that in the
absence of either of the two, proper results do not appear. In some
cases, one, and in others, the other, happens to be chiefly conducive to
a particular result, and hence comes to be regarded as the cause of that
result. It often happens that human exertion, even though put forth, is
baffled when overpowered by a more powerful Destiny; just as wet fuel,
even though put in fire, does not burn, if the fire is weak. And even if
Destiny be weak, if it is helped by strong human effort, it succeeds in
producing its results; just as even wet fuel burns when put in powerful
fire, and it does not quench the fire. To this end there is the
following saying—‘Destiny, when weak, is set aside by Human Exertion,
and even intelligent effort is baffled by more powerful Destiny.’

It is in view of all this that the Author says —‘*of these two Destiny
is verily incomprehensible*; the term ‘*tu*’ denotes emphasis; the
meaning is that the real character of Destiny cannot be comprehended. It
cannot be even thought of at what time it will bring about its results;
specially as apart from the scriptures, we cannot form any conception of
it, we cannot fathom in what way it comes into existence and how it
operates.

As regards Destiny then, any enquiry concerning it would be futile among
human beings. Hence it is Human exertion, in the form of Action, that is
going to be described, forming, as it does, the subject-mater of the
treatise. And it is only in regard to ‘Human exertion’ that ‘*action is
possible*’. In connection with agricultural operations, it is possible
for us to form some idea, such as—‘I should carry on such and such
operations, by means of such and such appliances, and in this manner I
shall obtain such and such results’. In fact people undertake only that
action of which the beginning, the middle and the end can be perceived.
As regards ‘Destiny’, it is absolutely unthinkable in what manner even
men in trouble should act, until the result is actually perceived. Thus
Destiny bring ‘*incomprehensible*’, it is not necessary \[to devote much
attention to it. It is *human activity* which we can think over and then
do what has to be done; in fact the man who acts in a happazard manner,
without thinking of what he does, always comes to grief.

When the king is equipped with all the three ‘powers’, and endowed with
due exertion and energy, there arises in his mind a keen desire to
conquer other kingdoms; and it is when Human Exertion becomes helped by
Destiny that it accomplishes all his purposes. And towards the final
result it is Destiny that adds to excellence and all the rest of it is
accomplished by Human Exertion alone. In the case of the king who has
set out on conquest, if the enemy happens at the time to be under some
calamity, this is due entirely to Destiny; and in action, it is Human
Exertion that is most effective; so. in fact both stand on the same
footing.

Further, it has been held that “when Human exertion functions,
irrespectively of the ordering of Destiny, then it is with great
difficulty that it leads to success”. This means that if the man puts
forth his efforts when Destiny is against him, then, in regard to all
the eight forms of activity, cither it accomplishes his purpose only
with great difficulty, or it becomes entirely futile. Hence, even though
there be prospect of difficulties, yet no one shall rest satisfied with
simply resigning himself to Destiny.

When, on the other hand, Human Exertion operates in co-operation with
Destiny, then it accomplishes all his purposes—as delineated in the
Vedic texts—without difficulty. Thus whenever Human Exertion functions,
while Destiny is favourable, it accomplishes all his purpose without any
trouble at all. This idea is further confirmed by the following two
verses:—‘In some cases, when the man has put forth his effort in the
field—even though Destiny is against him—it brings him its due
reward;—sometimes the field is as if it were dead, and then all effort
is futile.’ It has often been found that though the man tries again and
again, the result does not accrue if the necessary aid in the form of
favourable Destiny does not come to his rescue.

Then again, ‘even though the man may have his Destiny favourable, yet,
in the absence of Exertion, no field can bear fruits without due Human
Exertion’. In fact it is only when the result has been gained that the
presence of favourable Destiny is inferred. Hence when there is no
Result, it follows that favourable Destiny was absent.

Others have held the view that when it has been found that Destiny has
been duly operative, and yet the result does not appear, this only
indicates that there has been no human exertion in the case; the case
being analogous to that of there being no tree when there is no seed. In
this view, Destiny is held to be represented by the Sun, the Moon and
the other planets, as also by Vāyu, Agni and Apas; and it is set right
by Human Exertion put forth with special care.—(205)

*Yājñavalkya* (l.348, 349).—‘The success of an act is dependent upon
Fate and upon Human Effort; of these Fate is determined by previous
births, and Human Effort is apparent. Some acts succeed by chance, some
through human effort; human effort is at the root of them all.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 313).—‘Fate is one’s own
deeds committed in previous births, hence the wise have held Effort to
be superior to Fate; adverse Fate is set aside by Effort. Fate, Effort
and Time,—on these three together depends the success of man’s
operations.’

*Rāmāyaṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 314).—‘It is only the man who is
weak and devoid of virility that depends upon Fate; one who is strong
and virile never gives in to Fate. One who tries to suppress Fate by
Human Effort never suffers.’

*Vyāsa* (Do., p. 315).—‘Fate consists of what the man has done himself
during his previous lives, and Human Effort is what he does during the
present life.’

Or, having made peace with his enemy, he, may return, accompanied by the latter,—finding in this the due fulfilment of the threefold reward consisting of an ally, gold and territory.—(206)

The king does not prosper so much by gaining gold and territory as he does by obtaining a firm ally, even though this latter be weak, if fraught with future possibilities.—(208)


Even a weak ally is highly commended, if he is righteous and grateful, has his people content, and is loyal and persevering in his actions—(209)

**(verses 7.206-211)**

For all men, agencies of happiness and unhappiness are set up by
Destiny, which is also styled ‘merit-demerit’; and when men fall into
troublesome positions, they pacify the unfavourable Destiny leading to
it by special efforts put forth towards the alleviating of the evil
influences; so that they are rendered favourable in the final result.
(?)

The ‘*knowledge* *of* *men*’ stands for *worldly experience*. The man
who is worldly wise is capable of rendering great help.

The ‘*brave*’ man is generally clever in business.

The ‘*compassionate*’ man, is one who is of sympathetic nature, and
always saves men from undue greed (?)

The ‘*liberal*’ man is one who is always capable of providing a large
amount of wealth, (206-211)

**(verse 7.206)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrddaya* (Rājanīti, p. 412), which adds
the following notes:—The particle ‘*vā*’ indicates that what the verse
is speaking of is the alternative to war;—‘*prayatnato yuktaḥ*,’ ‘having
become fully equipped with all the equipments, such as sending the
ambassador and so forth, necessary for marching on the conquering
expedition,’—‘*saha*’, ‘with the enemy,’—‘*sandhim* *kṛtvā*,’ ‘having
made peace’;—‘*sampaśyan*,’ ‘rightly discerning,’ the ‘*triple result*’
in the shape of ‘friend, gold and territory’, and hence making peace on
the acquisition of any one of these three, he should ‘depart’, return to
his own kingdom.

**(verse 7.207)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, p. 412), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Maṇḍale*,’ ‘in the circle of twelve enemies’;—the
‘*pārṣṇigrāha*’, is the enemy whose territory lies immediately in the
rear of the king who is marching on an expedition against a state in his
front;—‘*ākranda*’ is the king whose territory lies behind that of the
said *pārsṇigraha*,—‘*samprekṣya*’, ‘having duly examined the strength
and weakness of both these’;—‘*mitrāt*’, ‘from the king against whom he
was marching and with whom he has made peace;’—‘*amitrāt*’, ‘from the
enemy against whom he was marching and who has not made peace with
him’,—the king undertaking the expedition shall obtain the point of his
expedition—in the shape either of victory over the enemy, or one of the
‘three results’ of *peace, in the shape of* ‘*fri* *end, gold and
territory*.’

**(verse 7.208)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 277);—and in
*Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 29a).

**(verse 7.209)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 277).

**(verse 7.210)**

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 743), as describing the
‘dangerous enemy’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 218);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 323).

**(verse 7.211)**

‘*Sthaulalakṣyam*’—‘Great liberality’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda
and Nandana);—Kullūka asserts that both Govindarāja and Medhātithi
explain the term as being ‘not sharp-sighted.’ As regards Medhātithi,
whose explanation Buhler could not decipher, his words
are—‘*Sthūlalakṣaḥ prabhūtasyāpi arthameṣām sarvakālam kṣamate*’, which
means that the man who is ‘*sthūlalakṣa*’ looks with equanimity upon the
ever-increasing prosperity of these (*i.e*., other kings). This may
imply *absence of sharp-sightedness*.—Hopkins says “Medhātīthi and
Govindarāja erroneously interpret as *subtility*”. While Govindarāja is
said by Buhler to explain the term to mean ‘*sūkṣmadars-hitvam* but this
is evidently wrong; as the *initial* ‘*a*’ Buhler has failed to notice
in the manuscript

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitṛodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 323).

Even though the land be as described he shall quit it without delay.

‘*Safe*’ — free from molestation at the hands of robbers and others.

‘*Fertile*’—productive of rich harvests, not dependent entirely upon
rain.

‘*Conducive to the increase of cattle*’,—being in a wild state, and
hence abounding in much fruit, or leaves or grass, the land becomes
conducive to the increase of cattle; abounding in tradesmen and
cultivators, free from famine and pestilence, and capable of maintaining
large numbers of men (?)

This does not mean that he shall evacuate in a hurry the territory
occupied by him; he should give up only that territory with regard to
which he feels that if he continued to stay, the people of the land
would try to recover it from him. So that as soon as he finds that
evacuation would not mean any financial or strategical harm to himself
and his allies, he shall, give up the territory even though it possesses
all the qualities described above.—(212)

The rule here laid down is extremely difficult to follow.

‘*For the sake of trouble*’,—*i.e*., for the purpose of removing
trouble; just as smoke set up for the removal of mosquitoes is said to
be ‘for the sake of mosquitoes’. For that purpose ‘*he shall save
wealth*’; there is no other use for saving wealth; as wealth has been
described as being for the sake of *giving* and *enjoying*. Hence it is
with due consideration of this that the king shall regulate his
expeditions and haltings and the winning over of the men of the other
party.

Even with wealth he shall protect his wife; the mention of the ‘wife’
includes all near relatives.

His own self is to be preserved; and if he cannot preserve himself by
any other way, he shall do it even by giving away all his property, or
even if it become necessary, by giving up his wife; for even after
having abandoned his wife and property, he may take to the vow of
silence and carry on a life of righteousness. Those persons who allow
themselves to perish for the sake of wealth or wife,—for them the wife
or the property serves no useful purpose, either visible or invisible,
because such an act is neither righteous nor unrighteous.

This forsaking of the wife does not apply to young
princes............... (?)

Though this rule has been laid down in the section dealing with the
‘King’s Duties’, yet, since it serves a distinctly useful purpose, it
should be taken as applicable to all persons.

*Objection*: “The king, having acquired a kingdom, and being possessed
of much wealth, shall perform the *Aśvamedha* and other elaborate
sacrifices and enjoy unequalled pleasures; what could the discontented
people do to him (in consideration whereof he should give up the
conquered territory)?”

There is no force in this objetion; even for men possessed of little
wealth, many righteous acts are possible, in the shape of the telling of
beads and so forth. It is only for certain acts of a peculiar character
that wealth is necessary; and under the circumstances stated it would
not be right to displease the people; hence such an act shall not be
done in a hurry.—(213)

And the reason for it is as follows:—

‘*Troubles*’—misfortunes due to human as well as divine agencies; when
these appear simultaneously, in connection with what forms the
subject-matter of the present context, then, the *wise man shall employ
all the expedients*’, ‘*collectively*’—*i.e*., gifts preceded by
conciliation, dissension preceded by conciliation, fighting accompanied
by conciliation, gifts and dissension,—or gifts along with the others,
and so on. That is, he śull make use of that particular expedient which

‘*Sādhayet kāryamātmanaḥ*’ is another reading for the last quarter of
the verse.

‘*The employer of the Expedients*’—*i.e*. himself; having obtained
himself, he shall accomplish his purpose, as if he were his own friend.

‘*All expedients*’— collectively and severally.

‘*The end to be attained*’— this also refers to all kinds of business in
general.

‘*Taking his stand upon*’— having resorted to; this *resorting to* is
accomplished by pondering over them,—as to whether the expedients are
efficient enough, what would be the proper thing to do, by what means is
such and such end to be attained,—all this be shall duly ponder over.

‘*All*’— refers to ‘*the three*’,—and means *entirely*.

The meaning thus comes to be that—‘for the accomplishment of his purpose
he shall employ that particular expedient which may be capable of
accomplishing it’.

As a matter of fact, the ends to be attained by means of the Expedients
are endless in number; so that it is not possible to mention them all in
detail; and hence they have been mentioned briefly and collectively. And
all this shall be duly pondered over. It is with reference to the
peculiar nature of the ends that it has been declared as follows:—

‘The careful man makes peace; the careful man has recourse to his own
prowess; both these should be equipped with statesmanship, without which
one would be as good as a thief.’—(215)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Upetāram*’—‘The employer of the means, *i.e*., the king himself’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘the
king’s minister’ (Nandana).

‘*Āśritya*’—‘Undertaking’ (Medhātithi);—‘depending upon’ (Govindarāja
and Kullūka);—‘pondering over’ (Nārāyaṇa and Raghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 413), which
explains ‘*upetāram*’ as ‘the employer of the means, *i.e*., the king
himself,’—and ‘*upeyam*’ as ‘one who is to be won by the means employed,
*i.e*., the enemy’—again, on p. 319, where also the explanations are
repeated;—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 50).

‘*There*’—in the inner apartment.

‘*Who are his own very self*’,—*i.e*. who are as watchful of his safety
as he himself would be.

‘*Who are conversant with the peculiarities of time*’— who know what
food and drink to give at what age and under what conditions.

‘*Uncorruptible*’— who cannot be alienated; thoroughly trustworthy.

‘*Servants*’—physicians and others.

The food shall be first ‘*tested*’—*i.e*. tasted by them; and then he
shall eat it.

The ‘testing’ shall be done by expert physicians by means of fire, the
partridge and such other things. If poison has been mixed with the food,
it becomes discolored upon drying, which shows its impurity; and when
poisoned food is thrown into the fire, it loses its odour, or becomes
too sour; there is a discolouring in the flame of the fire also; and if
birds are given the food, they suffer in various ways; e.g. the *Kokila*
dies at the mere sight of poisoned food; the *Jīvaka* becomes withered,
by merely looking at poison; the eyes of the *Chakora* (partridge)
become destroyed,—and the *Muṣka* (?) begins to perspire.

He shall also repeat over suspected food those sacred texts that are
believed to be destructive of poisons.—(217)

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 161).—‘He shall touch no
food or bed or clothes or ornament until it has been tested.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.85).—‘He shall not taste any food that has not been tried
before.’

*Kāmandaka* (7.9).—‘The King should always be careful regarding his
conveyances, beds, seats, drinks, eatables, garments and ornaments and
everything else. He should shun these, even if the slightest suspicion
of their being poisoned is present.’

Do. (7.11, *et. seq*.).—‘*Bhṛṅgarāja*, *Śuka* and *Sārikā* emit
distressful notes at the sight of a venomous serpent. At the sight of
poison, the eyes of the *Chakora* lose their natural hue; the *Krauñca*
is visibly intoxicated; and the *Kokila*, becoming mad, perishes. At the
sight of poison, a feeling of languor always takes possession of
creatures.’

Examining, by means of one of those methods, his eatables, the King
shall eat them.

In order to test the rice offered to him, the king shall at first throw
some of it on fire, and then some to the birds and watch the effects. If
there is poison in the rice the flame and fumes will assume a blue
colour and there will be crackling sounds; and the birds eating the rice
will die. Curry contaminated with poison soon becomes juiceless and
vapid; when decocted, it yields blue spume, and then its flavour, etc.,
are destroyed; etc., etc., etc.’

*Śukranīti* (1.653-657).—‘For fear of poisons the king should examine
his food through monkeys and cocks. At the very sight of poisoned food,
drakes begin to limp, bees to hum, peacocks to dance, cocks to crow,
cranes to get intoxicated, monkeys to pass stools, rats to become
excited, birds to vomit. Thus is the food to be examined.’

The ‘*seat*’ has been mentioned here by way of illustration; the sense
being that he should exercise the same caution with regard to the
