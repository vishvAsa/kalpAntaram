The section on Marriage is finished.

In the fire in which the marriage-rites have been performed, one should
perform the ‘Gṛhya rites,’—*i.e*., rites that have been prescribed by
the authors of *Gṛhyasūtras* as to be performed with the help of fire;
*e.g*., the *Aṣṭakā śrāddha*, the *Pārvaṇaśrāddha*, Libations, and so
forth.

‘*Five sacrifices*’—to be described later on;—‘*the rite*,’ the
performance of these—(should be done) in that same fire.

“Though the text speaks of the ‘five sacrifices’ without any
specification, yet (among them) the Vaiśvadeva-offering alone is to be
made in the fire; in the offering of the water-libations, etc., there is
no need for the fire. Why then should the text speak of the ‘rite of
five sacrfices’ as to be performed *in the fire*?”

Some people explain that, though the locative ending is one only, yet it
may be regarded as diverse in reference to the diversity in the objects;
hence, in the present context, the term ‘five sacrifices’ has been used
in the sense of a part only of the five sacrifices.’

Or (another explanation is that), the phrase, ‘*in the* *f* *ire*,’ is
not to be construed with the ‘*rite of the five sacrifices*,’—the
Vaiśvadeva-offering, which is made into fire, being already included in
the preceding phrase (‘*gṛhya* rite ’). The construction in this case
would be—‘the Householder should perform the rite of the five
sacrifices, and in the Marriage-fire he should perform the *gṛhya* or
domestic rites, as also the daily cooking.’

The term ‘*gṛha*,’ *house*,’ denotes *wife*; hence what is meant is that
the ‘*householder*,’ *i.e*., one, who has married a wife, should perform
the rites, in association with one’s wife.

Some writers on the Gṛhyasūtras have declared that at marriage, fire
should be produced by the friction of two sticks; while, according to
others, one may bring burning fire from anywhere he likes and make his
offerings into that.

The injunction that the domestic rites shall be performed in the
marriage-fire implies that the fire kindled at marriage shall be kept
up.

On this point some people make the following observations:—The
maintaining of the marriage-fire should be necessary for the *Śūdra*
also; as for him. also the performance of the ‘*Pākayajña*’ has been
ordained; nor does the present text specify any particular caste; all
that is found is the general term ‘householder,’ and the *Śūdra* also is
a ‘householder,’ the marrying of a wife being prescribed for him also.
This is what has beeu declared elsewhere (in Yājñavalkya, *Ācāra*,
97)—‘The householder should everyday perform the *smārta* rites in the
marriage-tire.’”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—What has been declared is that
‘Gṛhya rites are to be performed in the marriage-fire;’ but there is no
special rite named ‘*gṛhya*;’ hence the name ‘*gṛhya*’ should be taken
as indirectly indicating the rites prescribed by writers on
*Gṛhyasūtras*; and these writers have prescribed the rites for the three
higher castes only, and not for the *Śūdra*. In fact, in the Gṛhyasūtras
we find a summing up in the words—‘The sacrificial rites have been
described, we are now going to describe the Gṛhya rites;’ and the
purpose for which these words have beeu added is to imply that ‘those
persons only are entitled to the performance of the *Gṛhya* rites who
are entitled to that of the *sacrificial* ones;’ and it is not meant, as
it has been explained by others, that the latter constitute the duty of
others also. If this had been meant, then it would not have been
asserted that—‘the times for *Prāduṣkaraṇa* and Homa are analogous to
those of the *Agnihotra*.’ Nor, again, is it right to take the term
‘*gṛhya*’ to mean ‘pertaining to the home’ (domestic); for the term
‘home’ (*gṛha*) could only mean either ‘house’ or ‘wife;’ now, as a
matter of fact, for no rite has the ‘house’ been specifically prescribed
as the location, in view of which the rite could be prescribed for the
householder in terms of the ‘house,’ Then, again, such rites also as are
performed for the sanctification of one’s house—such for instance, as
the testing of the building-site, and so forth—have been prescribed for
the three higher castes only, and not for the *Śūdra*. If, on the other
hand, the term ‘home’ means the ‘wife,’ then the act meant having been
already implied by the term ‘householder,’ the name ‘*gṛhya*’ would be
superfluous.

As for the statement in the other *Smṛti* (Yājavalkya, *Ācāra* 97)—‘The
householder should every-day perform *Smārta* rites in the
Marriage-fire, or in the fire set up at the time of partition, and the
*Śrauta* rites in the sacrificial fires,’—here also, since it has not
been specifically stated what the ‘*smārta* rites’ are, the statement
must be taken as qualified by some other statement; specially because,
as a matter of fact, all *smārta* rites cannot be performed in fire; nor
is there anything to indicate that the term refers to *Homa* (offerings
into fire) only; nor, again, is it necessary that all *Homa* -offerings
shall be made into fire.

From all this the term ‘gṛhya’ has to be explained as standing for the
*rites prescribed by the* authors of *Gṛhyasūtras*. Both these *smṛti-*
texts (the present one, and Yājñavalkya I, 97) only refer to what has
been prescribed by the authors of *Gṛhyasūtras*. So that how could there
be any setting up of the fire by a *Śūdra?*

Further, Yājñavalkya’s text lays down the additional fact that ‘Śrauta
rites are to be performed in the sacrificial fire;’ and this must be
taken as pertaining to the three higher castes only. Under the
circumstances, if the former statement (regarding *smārta* rites) were
taken as pertaining to all the four castes, and the latter (regarding
the *śrauta* rites) to three castes only, then this would involve the
incongruity of one and the same set of words having two different
imports. And, so long as a uniform import can be found, there can be no
justification for admitting such a diversity.

‘*Daily*’—that which is done day after day; *e.g*., the cooking that is
done every day for one’s own food;—this also is to be done in the same
fire.—(67)

*Medhātithi* (P. 217, l. 27)—‘*Etadevānyatra paṭhitam*’.—The verse is
quoted from Yājñavalkya (1.97), where *Mitākṣarā* explains the phrase
‘*smārtam karma*’ as ‘the Vaiśvadeva and other religious rites
prescribed in the *Smṛtis*’, as also ‘the ordinary worldly acts of
cooking and the like’, while *Aparārka* explains it simply as ‘acts laid
down in the *Smṛtis*’.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 301);—and in *Śāntimayūkha*
(p. 4).

*Gautama* (5.7-9).—‘The installation of Fire begins either with marriage
or with succession to property; in that are the Gṛhya-rites to be
performed; as also the sacrifices to Gods, Pitṛs and Men, and also Vedic
Study.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 97).—‘The Householder should every day perform the
Smārta-rites in the marriage-tire, or in the fire installed at the time
of succession to property; and the Śrauta rites are to he performed in
the Śrauta Fire.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.1-3).—‘The Householder shall perform the Pākayajñas in the
Marriage-Fire; also the Agnihotra, both morning and evening; he shall
also pour libations to the Gods.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.75).—‘The installation of Fire begins with marriage;
in that should the rites be performed till such time as the regular
Laying of the Fire.’

*Śātātapa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 393).—‘The Vaiśvadeva offering may
be made either in the ordinary fire or in the Vedic fire.’

*Aṅgiras* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 393).—‘Homa is prescribed as to be
done in that fire in which one cooks his food.’

*Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 393).—‘All the Pākayajñas are to he
offered in the Marriage Fire.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.25-26).—‘The duties of a Householder are to perform the
Agnihotra, to live by the prescribed professions and to avoid sexual
intercourse on the Parvas. The duties of those who have married and
settled down are—to worship gods, pitṛs and guests, to show mercy to the
poor and the distressed and to live according to *Śruti* and *Smṛti*.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse serves to indicate the occasion for the prescribing of the
‘five sacrifices.’

‘*Slaughter-houses*’—*i.e*., it is as if they were slaughterhouses.
Places where animals are killed for the purpose of their flesh being
sold, or those where meat is sold, become sources of sin, by being used
for the purpose of obtaining meat; similarly, the hearth and other
things also, being sources of sin, come to resemble the
‘slaughter-house.’

As a matter of fact, there is no direct scriptural prohibition bearing
specifically upon the ‘hearth’ and other things; nor is there any
general prohibition regarding them. It is not impossible for men to have
a desire for the heat (provided by the hearth). We do not find any such
*acts* as are accomplished by means of the hearth, etc., which could be
prohibited by other texts. Nor can the prohibition be inferred from what
is stated in the present text itself; for the simple reason that it is
clearly understood as to be construed along with the next verse (which
is an *injunction*, not a *prohibition*); so that, if the present text
were taken as a prohibition, this would involve a syntactical split; and
further (the use of the Hearth, etc., being prohibited by this verse)
the occasion for the performance of the ‘Five Sacrifices’ would be
afforded only when the acts that are done by means of the Hearth, etc.,
would be done by means of other things. Nor, again, have the peculiar
characteristics (of such acts) have been described anywhere, the
presence whereof would indicate the similarity of certain acts (to the
acts accomplished by means of Hearth, etc.) and their consequent
prohibition. And a further result of this being taken as the prohibition
of the Hearth, etc., and as such having no connection with the
injunction of the sacrifices, would be that the sacrifices would be
performed by such men as would eat food cooked by others (and thus avoid
the use of the Hearth), or would use water directly from the river and
other reservoirs (thus avoiding the use of the water-jar). Then, again,
if a prohibition of the Hearth, etc., were intended, then directly
prohibitive words would have been used in the text; why should it have
been left to be inferred? Direct assertion is always more forcible, if
the prohibitive implication were admitted for the purpose of indicating
the expiatory rites to be performed in connection with the acts,—then
the right thing would have been to include it under Discourse XI (where
expiatory rites are dealt with). Further, such a prohibition might lead
to the abandoning of the particular acts; but the use of the Hearth
cannot be avoided; hence there can be no prohibition of them; and there
being no prohibition, wherefore would there be any expiatory rite?

From all this it follows that the ‘Five Great Sacrifices’ are not to be
performed for the destroying of sins; bub what is meant by saying that
they serve to expiate,—destroy—the sin involved in the using of the
Hearth, etc., which cannot be avoided for a single day—is that the daily
performance of the sacrifices is absolutely essential and compulsory.

‘*Becomes stricken*’—the first consonant is *v*; and the meaning is that
‘he is stricken by sin, and is ruined in regard to his body and
belongings, etc.;—or, (if we read *ba*) the meaning may be that ‘be
becomes connected with (tainted with) sin the root (in ‘*badhyate*’)
denoting *overpowering*.

‘*Using*’—*i.e*., employing for one’s purpose. When a man employs the
hearth and other things for such purposes as present themselves, he is
said to ‘use’ them.

*Hearth*.—place of cooking; the oven, etc.

‘*Grinding-stone*’—the stone-slab, and the grinding piece.

‘*Household implement*’—such things as the pot, kettle and such other
household requisites.

‘*Pestle and mortar*’—by which corn is thumped.

‘*Water-jar*’—the pot containing water.—(68)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Upaskaraḥ*’—‘The pot, the kettle and other household implements’
(Medhātithi);—‘a pot, a broom and the rest’ (Kullūka);—‘a broom and the
rest’ (Rāghavānanda);—all these take the word in the collective sense,
including all ‘household implements’;—Nārāyaṇa alone takes it in the
purely singular sense of ‘the broom’ only.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 533) as laying down the
sources of ‘the sin of the slaughter house’;—it adds the following
explanations:—‘*Sūnā*’ means occasions for killing’;—‘*cullī*’ is the
cooking place’;—‘*Peṣaṇī*’ ‘grinding stone’;—‘*upaskaraḥ*’ ‘the broom
and the rest’;—‘*Kaṇḍanī*,’ ‘mortar and pestle’;—by making use of these
the man incurs sin.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 389) quotes the verse and adds the following
explanations:—‘*Sūnā*’ is ‘occasion for the killing of living
beings’;—‘*Upaskaraḥ*’ is ‘the broom, the pot, the stick and the rest’;
‘*bādhyate*’ (which is its reading for ‘*badhyate*’) means ‘is
stricken—*i.e*., by sin accruing from the killing of
animals’;—‘*vāhayan*’ means ‘making use of,’ ‘operating.’

*Sūnās* or slaughterings—by which is meant *that which destroys living
beings*; these are of five kinds: The first *slaughtering* is done by
people hurriedly entering water, by swimming, splashing, throwing about
of water, catching of impurities, and moving in water; (2) the second
they do by hurriedly walking in darkness or in dim light, or by
trampling (upon insects); (3) the third they do by striking, collecting,
capturing, grinding, tearing and so forth; (4) the fourth they do by
attacking, rubbing, pounding and so forth; (5) the fifth by tiring,
heating, sweating, frying, cooking and so forth. These are the five
*slaughterings*, t he source of sin, which people do day by day.’

‘*Of these*’— of the Hearth and the other ‘slaughter-houses.’

‘*For the purpose of expiating*’—*i.e*., for the purpose of removing the
evils proceeding from them.

‘Course’—The ‘course’ meant are—*smearing* of the Hearth, *scraping* of
the grinding-stone, and so forth.

‘*Have been ordained by the great sages*;’—have been declared as to be
performed;—‘*the live great sacrifices*,’ ‘*for householders*’—*i.e*.,
for persons who have entered the householder’s state—the term
‘*grhamedha*’ stands for the Householder’s state.

‘*Daily*’—as no particular period has been specified, we gather that
they are to be performed throughout life; and it is thus that their
compulsory character becomes estsblished.

‘*Great sacrifices*’—this is the name of the rites to be performed.—(69)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse contains the injunction of the exact form of the Five
Sacrifices.

The term ‘*teaching*’ here includes ‘learning’ also: as will be
explained in verse 74 below. The mere act of ‘reciting’ does not require
any pupils. In the Vedic text describing the ‘debts’ of man, it has been
stated in general terms that ‘by means of Vedic study one pays off one’s
debts to the sages.’ For these reasons, both ‘teaching’ and ‘learning,’
according to circumstances, constitute ‘the offering to Brahma.’

‘*Tarpaṇa*’—the offering of ‘food or water,’ as described below, in 82.

‘*Homa*’—the offering into fire made to the deities to be described
later on.

‘*Bali*’—*i.e*., offering made into receptacles other than fire, such as
the wooden mortar and the like. This is the ‘*offering to
elementals*;’—*i.e*., the offering made in honour of the elementals.
This is only the name of a particular rite.

The making of offerings has been prescribed under the name of ‘*bhūta*,’
‘lemental,’ in the text—‘offerings made to elementals stalking during
the day, etc., etc.;’ and through association, the whole set of rites is
expressed by the term ‘offering to elementals.’ Just as among the
‘*Cāturmāsya*’ sacrifices, though the *Āmikṣā* is the only one substance
that is offered to the Viśvedevas, yet the entire set of rites has been
spoken of us ‘*Vaiśvadeva*’ in the injunction, ‘one should offer the
*Vaiśvadeva* sacrifice.’ The term ‘*bali*’ is applied to such *Homas* as
are offered into receptacles other than fire; and they explain that
‘*bali* is offering to the gods.’

The ‘*honouring*’—*i.e*., receiving—‘*of guests*’ constitutes the
‘offering to men.’

“How can *Vedic study* be a ‘sacrifice?’ In it there are no offerings
made to gods; nor has any deity been mentioned in connection with it;
all that is done in it is that the letters of the Veda, without any
sense, are recited; and it has been said in connection with the
repeating of Vedic texts that some people say the words have no
meaning.”

True; the term ‘sacrifice,’ as also the term ‘great,’ are used (in this
connection) only figuratively, and they are meant to indicate high
praise. To the ‘honouring of guests,’ also the name ‘sacrifice’ is
applied only figuratively. Though it is possible for the Guest to be
regarded as a ‘deity,’ yet in the original injunction of the act, the
injunctive verbs used are ‘should feed,’ ‘should honour,’ and not
‘*should sacrifice*’ to guests. Just as we find in the expression
‘*puruṣarājāya karma vā*’ (where the act done in honour of the king of
men is also called ‘sacrifice.’)

These ‘Five Sacrifices’ are not to be performed simultaneously; because
the occasion for all is not the same; in fact, a distinct occasion has
been mentioned in relation to each. If the occasion for all were one and
the same, then, even when three or four of them would be done, it would
be as good as not done, till all the five were done. Just as in the case
of the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* sacrifice, (which?) consists of the three
sacrifices of the *Āgneya*, the *Agnīṣomīya* and the *Upāṃśu*, the
performance of only one or two of these does not discharge the complete
liability; and just as among the Domestic Rites themselves, the
‘Vaiśvadeva offering,’ which extends up to the ‘*Sviṣṭakṛt*’ offering,
is not regarded as complete, so long as there is a break in the offering
to any single deity. In fact, each of the five sacrifices has a distinct
occasion mentioned in relation to itself:—*e.g*. (1) ‘one should be
constantly addicted to Vedic study’ (verse 75), (2) ‘one should be
constantly addicted to making offerings to the gods’ (verse 75), and so
forth; and the prescribed occasion being distinct for each, each is
performed separately by itself; (3) as regards ‘honouring of the guest,’
the injunction for this appears quite distinctly (in 105), where the act
is described as ‘conducive to prosperity and fame.’

Further, of these five ‘sacrifices,’ the performance of four depends
upon the man himself; while that of ‘honouring the guest’ is conditional
upon the arrival of the guest. The guest is not to be invited; as in
that case he would not he a ‘guest’ (in the proper sense of the term);
as we shall explain later on that a person is a ‘guest’ only when he
comes of his own accord (unexpectedly). Thus, then, from among the five,
if one performs any one only and omits the rest,—one might incur the sin
of omitting to do what one should do; but what he has done does not
become as good as not done. It is for this reason that when a man has
not set up his own fire, though he is not, on that account, entitled to
the *Vaiśvadeva Homa*, yet it is incumbent upon him to perform ‘Vedic
Study,’ ‘*Tarpaṇa*’ and the rest. As for the setting up of one’s own
fire, other Smṛtis permit of this being done at other times also; it is
not necessary to set it up along with marriage itself. Says the
Smṛti—‘the setting up of the Fire begins either with marriage or with
succession.’

“The option of setting up the Fire at the time of succession may he
regarded as applicable only to one who has not married at all.”

This would he so if the setting up of the Fire were an end in itself. As
a matter of fact, however, the ‘setting up’ is for the purpose of
obtaining the Fire, and the Fire is for the purpose of performing rites;
rites, again, have been laid down as to be performed by one only when he
is associated with his wife, and not alone by himself. It is true that
some *Gṛhya* -writers have asserted that one should perform *śrāddhas*.
after having kindled the *Parameṣṭhiprāṇa* Fire; but this also pertains
to the man as associated with his wife; and this same also would be the
time for his ‘succession’ also. Nor is the performance of *śrāddhas*
impossible for one who has not set up the Fire; as it has been
prescribed even for one who has not even been ‘initiated’, in whose case
the use of the ‘*sradhā*’ alone has been excepted; and yet there is no
setting up of the. fire for him; as it is only one who is ‘learned’ (in
the Veda) that is entitled to it, and he is still without that learning
(before Initiation). As for the performance of the *Śrāddha* (though
this also presupposes knowledge of Vedic mantras), yet it has to be done
by the uninitiated boy to the best of his ablity, in obedience to a
direct injunction; this case being analogous to the performing of a
sacrifice by the Niṣāda (Śūdra) in accordance with a direct injunction.
Iu the event, however, of fire having been set up by his uncle or other
relations, in view of a ‘learned’ performer being available, the
uninitiated (and hence unlearned) boy is not entitled to the performance
of *śrāddhas*. If the setting up of fire be found to be prescribed in
the same context as *śrāddhas*, then one could set up the tire as an
accessory to the *śrādd* *ha*, after the completion of which it would he
abandoned.

Some people have quoted the *Smṛti*—“ The *Vaiśvadêva Homa* may be
offered in the ordinary fire also.” Others, again, hold that it is to to
performed by means of dry (uncooked) grains.—(70)

‘*Adhyāpanam*’—Nandana reads ‘*adhyāyanam*’ and explains that it is the
same as ‘*adhayanam*.’

Burnell declares that what makes India ‘the land of vermin’ is this
habit of the Hindus of offering food to all living beings!—To what
lengths will the detractor of a religion not go!

This is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 392);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
533);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 305), which adds that ‘*adhyāpana*’ stands
for ‘*adhyayana*’ ‘study,’ and ‘*tarpaṇa*’ for ‘*Śrāddha*’;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* ‘(II p. 306), which adds (like Medhātithi) that
‘*adhyāpana*’ includes ‘study’ also; and ‘*tarpaṇa*’ stands for the
daily *Śrāddha* offering;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 918), which
adds that this is only an enumeration of the rites and not an injunction
of the order in which they are to be performed,—some people hold that
the four ‘sacrifices’ here mentioned go under the name of
‘*Vaiśvadeva*,’ but according to *Mādhava*, that name applies to only
three—the Devayajña, the Pitṛyajña and the Bhūtayajña.

*Gautama* (5.3,4,9).—‘He should be the worshipper of Gods, Pitṛs, Men,
Sages and Elementals; he should study the Veda every day; sacrifice to
Gods, sacrifice to Pitṛs, and sacrifice, to Men; and also Vedic Study.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.6. 1-6).—‘These are the Five Great Sacrifices, these
also are the Great Sacrificial Sessions: Sacrifice to Gods, Sacrifice to
Pitṛs, Sacrifice to Elementals, Sacrifice to Men, Sacrifice to the Veda;
day after day, he shall offer Svāhā, ending with the supplying of
fuel,—in this manner does he accomplish the sacrifice to gods; day after
day, he shall offer Svadhā, ending with the water-offering,—in this
manner he accomplishes the sacrifice to Pitṛs; day after day, he shall
how down to the Elementals, ending with the offering of flowers,—in this
manner he accomplishes the Sacrifice to the Elements; day after day, he
shall offer food to Brāhmaṇas, ending with the offering of roots, fruits
and vegetables,—in this manner he accomplishes the Sacrifice of Men; day
after day he shall carry on Vedic Study, ending with the Praṇava,—in
this manner he accomplishes the sacrifice to the Veda.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 388).—‘He shall honour the Gods, the
Pitṛs and the Sages, respectively with the Kavya, the Kavya and the
Svādhyāya; *Havya* standing for what is offered into the Fire, with
*Svāhā*, which appeases the Gods,—*Svadhā* being what is offered to the
Pitṛs, which pleases the Pitṛs,—*Svādhyāya* being the reading that
starts with *om*, which sacrifices to the sages.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.20-25).—‘For the expiation of the sins, he shall perform the
Sacrifices to the Veda, the Gods, the Pitṛs, the Elementals and the Men;
Vedic Study constitutes the *Sacrifice to the Veda*;—Homa is the
*Sacrifice to the Gods*;—Water-libations to forefathers is the
*Sacrifice to the Pitṛs*;—the making of Bali-offerings constitute the
*Sacrifice to the Elementals*;—the honouring of guests constitutes the
*Sacrifice to Men*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.102).—‘Bali, Svadhā, Homa, Svādhyāya and Atithī-satkāra
are the great sacrifices to Elementals, Pitṛs, Gods, Veda and Men.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (3.1-2).—‘Now follow the Five Great
Sacrifices:—Sacrifice to Gods, Sacrifice to Elementals, Sacrifice to
Veda, Sacrifice to Pitṛs and Sacrifice to Men; the offerings made into
the Fire constitute the *Sacrifice to Gods*, the *bali-offerings*
constitute the *Sacrifice to Elementals*; the offerings made to Pitṛs
constitutes the *Sacrifice to Pitṛs*; the studying of the Veda
constitutes the *Sacrifice to Veda*; the offerings to Men constitute the
*Sacrifice to Men*.’

*Chandogapariśiṣṭa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 390).—‘The *Great
Sacrifices* should be understood to be those sacrifices that are offered
to Gods, Elementals, Pitṛs, Vedas and Men, in due order; the teaching of
Veda is the *Sacrifice to Vedas*, the water-offerings to forefathers is
the *Sacrifice to Pitṛs*, the offering of Homa is the *Sacrifice to
Gods*, the offering of *Bali* is the Sacrifice to Elementals, the
honouring of Guests is the *Sacrifice to Men*; or the *Sacrifice to
Pitṛs* may consist of *Śrāddha* or of offerings made to forefathers.’

*Śātātapa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 391).—‘He shall perform, in due
order, the Sacrifice to Elementals, the daily Śrāddha and the honouring
of guests, as also Vedic Study.’

*Jābāla* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 393).—‘Of the Great Sacrifices, the
first is accomplished by the water-libation; the Sacrifice to Gods is
accomplished by making offerings into Fire with the Sāvitrī-mantra, and
the Sacrifice to Elementals, by the Bali-offering; the Sacrifice to
Veda, by repeating Vedic texts; and the Sacrifice to Men, by the
honouring of guests.’

The necessity of performing the ‘sacrifices’ every day is what is
enjoined here; the rest is all mere reiteration.

The meaning is that these sacrifices should be performed, even though in
an imperfect manner,—to the best of one’s ability; this also follows
from the compulsory character of the acts; hence the text has added the
phrase ‘*to the best of his capacity*;’—the ‘*tasi*’ affix being added
to the term ‘*śakti*,’ which is included in the ‘*ādyādī*’ group.

‘*Hāpayati*’—This has the sense of the simple root (‘*hā*,’ to
*abandon*), no significance being meant to be attached to the causal
affix. Or, the word may be etymologically explained as derived from the
nona ‘*hā*’ (*omission*)—formed by the root ‘*hā*’ with the ‘*kvip*’
affix; ‘*hāpayati*’ being explained as ‘*hām* *apayati*’ ‘brings about
omission;’ *āp* + *kvip*, and then the nominal root formed by the
addition of the affix ‘*nich*.’ The meaning, in any case, is ‘*omits
not*.’

Living in his own house—where the ‘slaughter-houses’ cannot be
avoided—he does not become tainted with the sin resulting from them.
This is said in praise of the sacrifices.—(71)

This verse praises the original injunction by deprecating its omission.
Some people read this verse with the Dative
ending—‘*devatātithibhṛtyebhyaḥ pitṛbhyaścātmane tathā na nirvapati
panchabhyaḥ*.’

‘Offering’ here stands for actual *giving away*, not merely
*assignment*; hence, the Dative should be the right form.

He who does not make gifts to these,—even though he may be
‘*breathing*,’—carrying on the function of inhaling and exhaling
air,—‘*does not live*;’ *i.e*., is as good as dead, his living being
absolutely fruitless.

The term ‘*dependents*’ here should be taken as standing for ‘old
parents’ and others mentioned below (in 11.10); it does not stand for
*servants*; as gifts to these latter are made in return for services
rendered. Or, it may be taken as indicating such born slaves as become
incapable of rendering further service, on account of old age. We shall
also explain later on that it is necessary to feed old bulls, etc.
Gautama also has declared that ‘decrepit people, and those devoid of
livelihood, should be supported by him’ (10. 61).

The ‘offering’ to the gods consists of (*a*) pouring libations into
fire, (*b*) throwing ‘bali’-offerings on prepared altars; for what other
‘offering’ could there be, except these?—which is what is found in other
cases also;—*e.g*., those of the offerings made to the Viśvedevas and
other deities of the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* sacrifices, where the offerings
are made with such *mantras* as ‘*Agnaye tvā juṣṭam nirvapāmi*;’ where
also mere relationship (with the gods) is what is meant. It is for this
reason that the ‘elementals’ (to whom the *bali-* offerings are made)
become included under ‘gods,’ and hence not mentioned separately.

‘*Himself*’ has been added by way of illustration; the sense being—“just
as, without eating, one’s own living is not possible, and for that
purpose the use of food is absolutely necessary, in view of one’s life
being a very desirable thing,—specially according to the direct
injunction that ‘one should guard oneself against all things’—so also is
the feeding of gods and the rest absolutely essential.”—(72)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Bhṛtya*’ stands for ‘aged parents and others’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja
and Kullūka),—or ‘born slaves and others too old to work for them
living,’ also aged cattle &c., which is the alternative explanation,
suggested by Medhātithi, and not only ‘animals unfit for work,’ as noted
by Buhler. Nārāyaṇa, and Nandana read ‘*bhūtānām*’ and explain it as
‘goblins or living beings.’

This verse is quoted in *Viramītrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 392), which reads
‘*bhūtānām*’ for ‘*pāñcānām*’;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 146), in support of
the view that there is nothing wrong in doing the cooking for one’s own
self along with the gods and *Pitṛs*; it is only when one cooks for
himself alone that it is wrong.

In certain Vedic texts, it is these sacrifices that have been enjoined
under these names; hence the present verse mentions these names, with a
view to show that the injunction of these is based upon the Veda itself.

What is meant also is that the rites that have been mentioned in the
Veda by the names. ‘*Ahuta*’ and the rest, are also included here,
though not mentioned by the same names. This is another purpose that the
author had in view in mentioning these other names; just like the names
‘*brahmayajña*,’ ‘*śrāddha*,’ ‘*udvāha*,’ ‘*parikriyā*,’ and so
forth.—(73)

The sacrifice that has been described as ‘Ahuta’ is the same as
‘*Japa*.’ ‘*Japa*’ here should be taken as standing for *Vedic study*,
in view of the assertion that ‘by Vedic study one should worship the
sages.’ Or, it may be taken in the sense of the mental operation of
‘recalling to the mind’ (of Vedic texts). The root ‘*japa*’ has been
held to be denotative of both acts—that of loudly reciting, as well as
that of silently recalling to the mind.

The offering into fire is called ‘*Huta*.’

The offering to elementals is ‘Prahuta.’ Though this also is a kind of
‘*Homa*’ yet, in view of the fact that the terra ‘Homa’ is generally
restricted to offerings made into fire, people might think that the
offering to elementals is not ‘*homa*;’ hence (with a view to preclude
this notion) it has been given the name of ‘*Prahuta*,’—the act being
praised as *an excellent* (*pra*) *homa* (*huta*).’

‘*The honouring of Brāhmaṇas is Brāhmya-huta*.’—It is the receiving of
guests that is spoken of here as ‘*honouring of Brāhmaṇas*.’—(74)

It has been said above that the occasion for each of the Five Sacrifices
is distinct, and all of them do not form an aggregate; this same idea is
made clear by this verse.

When, by reason of poverty or some other cause, the necessary supplies
being not available, the honouring of guests and such other acts be not
possible, then one should be constantly engaged in Vedic Study.

‘*In acts in honour of the gods*’—the offering made in fire to the
Vaiśvadeva gods are ‘acts done in honour of the gods.’ Though the
‘sacrifice to elementals’ and ‘sacrifice to Pitṛs’ are all ‘in honour of
gods,’ yet from the context it is clear that it is the offering in fire
that is meant by the term ‘acts done in honour of gods.’

A commendatory exaggeration is added—‘*He who is engaged in*’—*i.e*.,
busy with—‘*acts in honour of the gods, upholds*’—*i.e*., supports—‘*the
moveable and immoveable*;’—*i.e*., he becomes the means of sustenance of

‘*Into the fire being thrown*’—by the sacrificer.

‘*Oblation*’—cooked rice, cakes and such other things, when thrown into
the fire, are called ‘oblation.’

‘*Reaches the sun*’—in an invisible form. The sun absorbs the essence of
all things; hence the essence of the oblation is described as reaching
the sun. This essence, evolving in the sun’s rays, becomes in time
developed into rain. From that proceeds ‘*food*’—in the shape of *Vrīhi*
and other grains. From that proceed ‘*creatures*,’—all living beings.

Thus, by throwing an oblation into the fire, the sacrificer continues to
help on the world-process.

What is stated here is only a commendatory supplement to the foregoing
injunction, and it is not meant to be literally true. If it were
literally true, then only one who desires rain would he entitled to the
performation of the act referred to; but no such thing has been asserted
anywhere. Nor is there any occasion for assuming such an assertion, when
it is possible to take the verse as supplementary to the principal
subject-matter of the context.—(76)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The present verse proceeds to indicate, in another way, the necessity of
performing the Great Sacrifices.

All creatures subsist by desiring support from ‘*Air*’—*i.e*., from
life-breath; no one can live without the life-breath; in fact, the act
of ‘living’ consists in the bearing of the life-breath.

The term ‘*creatures*’ stands for all living beings.

The epithet ‘*all*’ has been added with a view to the fact that the
subsistence of even gods and sages, who are endowed with superior
powers, is dependent upon Air.

Similarly, the Householder is like Air for persons in all other states.
Hence, what the Injunction means is that the Householder should act in
such a manner that all others may derive their subsistence from him.

Though the presence of the term ‘*other*’ would indicate that persons
other than householders were meant, yet the text is not meant to exclude
the householder from the said support, specially because the making of
gifts to guests and others has been specially prescribed for the
*Snātaka*. Hence the term ‘*other*’ is meant to indicate that the other
states are on the same footing as the state of the Householder. Nor has
it been declared anywhere that the Householder should not support
himself, or should not take steps for the supporting of the members of
his family \[and all this would excluded from his support if ‘other
states’ stood for states other than that of the Householder.\]

The compound ‘*itarāśramāḥ*’ is to be expounded as a *Karmadhāraya*
compound.—(77)

‘*Because men in all the three states are sustained*’—*i.e.,
helped*—‘*with knowledge*’—*i.e*., knowledge brought about by the
expounding of the meaning of the Veda—‘*and food*,’ by the
Householder,—therefore, ‘*the Householder’s state is the highest*’—best.

If we read ‘*gṛhī*’ for ‘*gṛham*,’ the compound ‘*jyeṣṭhāśramaḥ*’ should
be expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*; while with reading ‘*gṛham*’ it is
*Karmadhāraya*.

Here also the specification ‘*by Householders only*’ serves only to
re-iterate what is right and proper, and it does not mean that persons
in the state of the Recluse and others are not to do the work of
teaching. In fact, for the Recluse the work of teaching has been
specially enjoined in the verse—‘he should perforin these great
sacrifices, etc.’ (below, 6. 5). As for the Renunciate, it is true that
the according of any help to anybody has been prohibited by the rule—‘he
should take no part in injuring or helping’ (*Gautama* 3. 24-25); but
the expounding of the meaning of the Veda has been actually enjoined
among the duties of the Mendicant. Further, for the Recluse and the
Renunciate, much effort would not be needed in the expounding of the
Veda, as they are required to cultivate a high degree of knowledge,
dispassion, thought-power and practice. As for the Religious Student,
the work of teaching would interfere with his own proper work (of
study); and as for the gift of food, how could this be possible for him,
when he himself has been advised to live on alms?

Thus, since it is for the Housholder alone that the two are generally
possible, the text has used the phrase ‘*by Householders only*.’— (78)

*Dakṣa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 456).—‘Because gods, men and animals
are supported by the householder, therefore is the householder the best
of all. The householder has been described as the source of the other
three stages; whenever he suffers, the other three suffer with
him;...... for this reason, the householder is to be guarded with due
effort, and should be honoured and worshipped by the king, as also by
the other three.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do., p. 457).—‘In as much as it is from the householder
that proceed the birth, growth and maintenance of all the
life-stages,—he has been declared to be superior.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.14.16).—‘It is the householder alone who offers
sacrifices; it is he alone who performs austerities; among all the
life-stages, that of the householder is the best; just as all rivers and
rivulets find their final rest in the ocean, so do persons in the
various stages of life find their haven in the householder; just as all
living beings keep alive under the protection of their mother, so do
they also live under the protection of the householder.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.27.29).—‘The religious student, the renunciate and the
recluse, all these derive their living from the householders......... It
is the householder alone who performs sacrifices; he alone performs
austerities; he alone makes gifts; hence is the householder the highest
of all. Sages, Pitṛs and Gods (,?) Elementals and Guests have
expectations from householders; hence alone is the householder the
highest of all.’

*Gautama* (3.1).—‘Of these, the householder is the source; the others
being unproductive.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.6.29).—‘The teachers have held to a single life-stage;
the others being unproductive.’

‘*That state*’—*i.e*., the Householder’s.

‘*Should be kept up with care*’— should be maintained by one who desires
Heaven and one who is desirous of obtaining happiness in this world.

‘*Atyantam*,’ meaning ‘that of which there is no end,’ implies
*permanence*.

‘This state, *which cannot be maintained by men with weak organs*.’

The sense is as follows:—For the Householder, intercourse with women,
eating of rich food and such other luxuries are inevitable; but if one
were to become unduly addicted to such sensuous objects, one would be
incurring sin; hence it is said that ‘this has to be kept with greater
care than the other states;’ specially as in the Householder’s state
great restraint of the organs is called for; such for instance, as one
should not have intercourse with one’s wife, except during ‘season,’ he
should not have recourse to other people’s wives, he should eat only
such food as has been left (after the offering to the gods and the
feeding of guests). And Restraint, when the objects of enjoyment are
within reach, is extremely difficult.

‘*Imperishable heaven*;’—by this it is not meant that the attainment of
Heaven is the result of performing all the duties of the Householder;
because, as a matter of fact, among the duties of the Householder some
are compulsory (and as such not leading to any results), and for others
other rewards have been mentioned. It is true that those acts in
connection with which no rewards are mentioned are assumed to have their
reward in the attainment of Heaven; but in the present context these
duties only form subjects of *reference*; and hence, there would be no
point in the specifying of any rewards in connection with them. Hence
the phrase in question has to be taken merely as a reference to such
*desirable results* as follow from the prescribed acts. Nor can the
present text be taken as stating the desire for a definite result as
constituting the occasion for the performance of certain fresh duties;
because the same duties that have been prescribed as necessary
throughout life might very well be spoken of as to be performed by one
who is desirous of obtaining Heaven; specially as the mention of Heaven
is clearly found to be on the same footing as ‘desiring happiness in
this world,’ which is a reward that can have no connection with anything
that is enjoined; for ‘happiness in this world’ can never be recognised
as the reward of any religious act, specially as no particular form of
happiness is specified; we do not find the happiness in any way
specified as that proceeding from the acquisition of landed property, or
of a son, and so forth. And if the happiness is not specified, it means
the same thing as ‘Heaven.’ But Heaven cannot be said to beloug to ‘this
world.’ Hence this phrase should be taken as referring to the
experiencing of perceptible (physical) pleasures. Men in the other
‘states’ are without homes, living either under trees or in the house of
other people; and as such they live uncomfortably. Hence the phrase
‘desiring happiness’ has to be taken as a mere reiterative reference.
And, consequently, the former phrase, ‘desiring Heaven,’ also, standing
on the same footing, has to be taken as a re-iterative reference.—(79)

These ‘*have expectations from family-men*,’—*i.e*., seek to obtain
presents from them. ‘*Expectation*’ means wishing for help and benefits.

For this reason, one should fulfil towards them—the gods, &c.—all that
is enjoined, in the shape of offerings, &c. ‘*One who knows*’—the
ordinances of the scriptures.

What is meant by the words ‘*svādhyāyamadhīyīta*’ (‘one should study the
Veda’) is exactly what is meant by the words, ‘*one should worship the
sages by Vedic Study*.’

As a matter of fact, what is called *worship* is done either (*a*) by
means of faith and devotion, or (*b*) by means of offering water for the
feet, garlands and sandal-paint. But the present verse is purely
eulogistic; ‘Vedic Study’ cannot be the means of either of these two
forms of ‘worship’ of the sages. As for the *mantras* of the Veda, those
also contain praises of Agni and other gods (and not the sages). For all
these reasons the statement that ‘one should worship sages by Vedic
Study’ is purely eulogistic.

Or, the term ‘*sages*’ may be taken as standing, not for *Marīci* and
other persons (generally known as ‘sages’), but for the *Vedas*
themselves. The term ‘*svādhyāya*’ (Vedic Study) here denotes an
*action*; it does not stand for the *Veda*, as it does in the sentence,
‘*svādhyāyo* *dhyetavyaḥ*’ (‘the Veda should be studied’). Hence what
the passage means is that ‘one should worship the Vedas by the act of
study;’ *i.e*., one should study them in the proper manner; no other
form of ‘worship’ being possible.

‘*The gods by Homa-offerings*’—here also the ‘worship’ is figurative;
for in a Homa, the deity is not the most predominant factor,—being only
a subordinate factor, tending to the fulfilment of the act.

‘*The Pitṛs by Śrāddha offerings*’—here the Injunction is to be taken in
its direct sense; and this shall be explained under the section on
‘*Śrāddha*.’

‘*The men*’—*i.e*., guests, beggars, and so forth—‘one should
worship’—*i.e*., give them food with due respect.—(81)
