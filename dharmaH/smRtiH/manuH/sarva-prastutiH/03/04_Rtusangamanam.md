<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Marriage has been described. Marriage having been accomplished, and the
wifehood of the girl having been established, one might have the idea
that he was entitled to have intercourse with her that same day; hence,
with a view to preclude the possibility of this being done, the text
proceeds with the following rules.

One should not have recourse to his wife immediately after marriage, on
the same day; he should wait for her puberty. In fact, the authors of
*Gṛhyasūtras* have declared that ‘after marriage, for three days or
twelve days, or tor a year, the pair should take food without salt,
observing continence and lying down upon the ground.’ (*Āśvalayana*, 1.
8. 10-12.) Hence, if puberty appears in course of the year, there should
be no intercourse; similarly, even after the said time, there is to be
no intercourse before puberty. In this manner, there is to inconsistency
between the present text and the rule laid down by Aśvalāyana. As for
the mention of the option of ‘three days,’ etc., what is meant is that,
if the pair happen to be very passionate, they might adopt the lesser
periods, but others should observe continence (for the full period of
twelve months).

‘*Season*’ is that period of time during which the bodily condition of
woman is marked by a flow of blood and indicates her capacity for
conception. The actual sight of blood being merely an indication, even
after the actual flow has ceased, the time that follows—up to the limit
to be described below—is also called the ‘season.’ Or, because of the
association of the name ‘season’ with the term ‘period,’ the period
itself may be regarded as the ‘season;’ and in this case, we would have
the appositional compound (in ‘*ṛtukāla*’).

The person who has resolved to approach only during the season is culled
‘*one who observes the rule* *of* *approaching only during the season*;’
the affix ‘*ṇini*’ (in *gāmī*) having the sense of *vote* or *resolve*,
according, to Pāṇini 3. 2. 20; just as we have in the case of such terms
as ‘*sthaṇḍilaśāyī*,’ ‘*aśrāddhabhojī*,’ and the like.

‘*Syāt*’— should be. Even though the injunctive ending has been added to
the root ‘*as*,’ *to be*, yet what it enjoins is the act of
‘approaching;’ the phrase ‘*abhigāmī syāt*’ being equivalent to
‘*abhigacchet*, ‘should approach;’ specially as, unless one does the act
of *approaching*, he cannot become ‘*abhigāmin*.’

What sort of ‘*rule*’ is this? (*a*) is it that one must approach her
during the ‘season?’ (*b*) or that he should approach *her only*, during
the ‘season?’ That is to say, is the rule *restrictive* or *preclusive*?

“Well, the very name ‘*vrata*,’ ‘*vow*,’ indicates scriptural
*restriction*; and the verbal affix ‘*ṇini*’ denotes ‘vow;’ so that why
should there be any question of its being *preclusive?*”

Our answer to this is as follows:—We shall show later on that
*preclusion* also is scriptural in character and restrictive in form.

“What then is the difference between the two?”

Restriction is supplementary to Injunction.

“What is Injunction?”

Injunction is that word which expresses the idea of some act to be done;
*e.g*., in the sentence ‘one desirous of Heaven should offer the
Agnihotra.’ With the exception of this sentence, there are no other
words which could give us the idea of the *Agnihotra* as something to be
done. We have ‘restriction’ in a case where the partial idea of
something to be done for the purpose of a transcendental result is
obtained even without the scriptural words; *e.g*., if we have the
injunction ‘one should offer the sacrifice on even ground,’ in
connection with the *Daśapūrṇamāsa* sacrifices, the idea of some place
in general where they are to be performed is implied by the nature of
the act itself; no sacrifice can be performed, except at some place; and
places are of two kinds, *even* and *uneven*; now, in the event of the
sacrificer happening to select an even spot \[merely on the strength of
the general injunction of the sacrifice\],—the words, ‘should offer the
sacrifice on even ground,’ become merely descriptive; but if, by reason
of man’s desire being untramelled, some one were to elect to perform his
sacrifice on *uneven* ground, then the words, ‘should offer the
sacrifice on even ground,’ become useful by asserting the necessity of
adopting *even* ground; for, when the words clearly enjoin the *even*
ground, the avoiding of *uneven* ground follows directly from the fact
of its not being enjoined; so that the avoiding of uneven ground is
obtained from the implication of the injunction of even ground. For
every performance being dependent upon injunction, wherefore could there
be adoption of what is not enjoined at all? If such were adopted, there
would be no accomplishment of the act in due accordance with what has
been enjoined.

\[ The above being an example of Restriction from *Śrauta* literature\]
we have an example from *Smārta* literature in the shape of the
Injunction—‘One should eat food facing the East.’ When a man is going to
take food, it is open to him to face any direction he likes; so that at
one time he might face the East, at another he might face the West, or
any other direction; and when he would face the East, he would not face
any other, while when he would face another direction he would not face
the East. Hence in the event of the man electing to face another
direction, the injunction that ‘one should eat food facing the East’
comes in useful; and by disobeying this, one would be transgressing a
scriptural injunction.

Similarly, in the case in question, the act of approaching one’s wife at
any time one chooses aṇd not approaching her during the ‘season,’ would
make one open to the charge of transgressing the scriptural injunction;
as he would, partially (*i.e*., by not approaching during ‘season,’ and
by approaching out of season) be omitting to do what has been directly
enjoined; and the act of approaching (out of season) would make him
subject to expiation in the same manner as the transgressing of other
acts enjoined in the scriptures. When it is open to one to approach
one’s wife, through passion, both during ‘season’ and out of it, then we
have use for such a direction as ‘one should approach one’s wife *only
during season, and never out of season*,’ Just as the direction ‘five
five-nailed animals are edible,’ has its use when it is open to man,
under the influence of hunger, to eat the hare, etc., (which are
permitted), as well as the monkey and the rest (which are not
permitted). In this case, there is nothing to indicate that the two sets
of animals may he eaten in turn (as it is possible in the case of the
approaching of one’s wife during ‘season’ and also, at another time,
‘out of season’). So that in the case just cited (of the edibility of
five five-nailed animals), there is possibility of both (eating of hare,
etc., and eating of monkey, etc.) being done simultaneously; and hence
we have the direction ‘*only five* five-nailed animals are edible,’
which serves to preclude the other alternative (of *all* five-nailed
animals being eaten). And thus, in this case, we have *Preclusion*.

“But they say that Preclusion is beset with three defects: in every case
of Preclusion three defects crop up: (1) the renouncing of its meaning,
(2) the assuming of a different meaning and (3) the setting aside of
what is possible.

\(1\) Now in the case of the words, ‘five five-nailed animals are
edible,’ the idea afforded by it is in the affirmative form—‘five
five-nailed animals should be eaten:’ and this is renounced when the
words are taken to mean the negativing of the eating of animals other
than the five.

\(2\) Further, no negation is expressed by the words of the sentence;
hence, when it is taken as *preclusive*, a meaning different from its
own becomes assumed.

\(3\) Lastly, it being open to the hungry man to eat all animals, when
the sentence is token as preclusive, that which is possible becomes set
aside. These are the three defects that beset every case of preclusion.”

There is nothing in all this. If the man is hungry, the eating of
animals is already open to him; so that no injunction being needed for
that purpose, it is not possible for the sentence to be taken in its
direct sense (that certain animals shall be eaten); and hence, in order
to guard against the futility of the injunction (if token
affirmatively), if it is taken in the negative sense (of *preclusion*),
there can be no incongruity in this. It has been thus declared—‘when
what is laid down is what is absolutely unknown, it is a case of
*injunction*; it is a case of *Restriction* when the course laid down is
partially (*i.e*., optionally) possible; and it is a case of
*Preclusion* when what is laid down is possible, as also something
else.’ (*Tantravārtika* 1. 2. 42).

Now we have to consider what is the right view to take in regard to our
text.

Since the present case fulfills the condition of Preclusion that ‘what
is laid down is possible, as well as something else,’ it should be taken
as a Preclusion. It is possible for the man to approach his wife ‘during
the season’ as well as ‘out of season;’ but if the approaching is done
‘daring season,’ then it cannot be done ‘out of season’ at the same time
(*i.e*., both alternatives are not possible at the same time). Just as
when the man is hungry, it is open to him to eat at *śrāddhas* as well
as not at *śrāddhas*; and when the rule says, ‘he should eat not at
*śrādḍha*,’ he simply avoids eating at *śrāddhas*; and he does not give
up all food, seeking thereby to obey the injunction of not eating at
*śrāddhas*;—similarly, when the man has a longing for intercourse, it is
open to him to have recourse to it at all times, and we understand the
present rale to mean that ‘one should not approach one’s wife out of
season.’ The act of approaching itself being already possible by reason
of the man himself desiring it, it is only right that the sentence
should be taken as laying down the proper time for that act. Otherwise,
it would be prescribing something not referred to before at all.
Farther, the obeying of the injunction of begetting children is possible
only for one who has married; and this begetting is possible only by
approaching one’s wife daring ‘season;’ so that the act of approaching
daring ‘Beason’ is already rendered possible by all this. Then, again,
for one who has already got a child, the act of approaching oue’s wife
again for the purpose of begetting a second child cannot be regarded as
being done in accordance with the injunction of begetting children, for
the injunction being in the form ‘one should beget a child,’ and the
singular number in ‘child’ being meant to be significant, the injunction
will have been duly fulfilled by the- begetting of the first child.
\[Thus, then, there would be no point in the present text enjoining the
act of approaching one’s wife during ‘season’\]. Nor could the
approaching be taken as laid down for the purpose of accomplishing a
transcendental result; because it is not possible to impose upon it
either the character of a sacramental rite, or that of an act for a
definite result; specially, as the act of approaching during ‘season’ is
already implied by the injunction of ‘begetting a child.’ From all this
it follows that the statement that ‘one should approach one’s wife
during season’ is meant to prohibit the act ‘out of season;’ so that, in
its own(?) form, it is merely re-iterative (of what has been enjoined in
regard to the begetting of a child), but in its indirect sense it is a
*Preclusion*. And when thus taken in this indirect sense, the passage
comes to serve a distinctly useful purpose.

When it is thus, taken, then this text does not conflict with what has
been said in Gautama’s work. In the latter, it is asserted—‘one should
approach one’s wife during season, or at all times, with the exception
of the sacred days’ (5. 1-2); and here the phrase, ‘or at all times,’
mentions an option, which permits freedom of action; and there would be
no point in laying down any such rule as ‘one may do the act *at all
times*, during season as well as out of season;’ and (as the words
stand) when the preceding clause is taken as laying down the rule that
‘one should approach one’s wife during season,’ the same verb, ‘should
approach,’ being construed with the subsequent phrase, ‘at all times,’
this also would have to be regarded as a rule, occurring as it does in
the same context as the preceding rule; specially because, so long as
the word is not actually repeated in the text (and is construed with the
latter clause only as it stands in the preceding clause), no different
meaning can be attributed to it. And it has already been explained that
there would be no point in any restriction being imposed, apart from the
‘season.’

From all this it follows that the assertion regarding ‘approaching
during season’ is meant to prohibit the act ‘out of season.’ For one who
has not yet got a son, the restriction (regarding approaching during
season only) is got at from a different injunction (that of begetting a
child); but for one who has already got a son might do what he likes
(hence the prohibition becomes useful).

The act of approaching the wife out of season having been prohibited,
the text proceeds to make an exception in the case of the wife evincing
a desire for intercourse—‘*In consideration of her, he may approach her,
except on the sacred days*.’ ‘Her’ refers to *the wife*. ‘*In
consideration of her*,’—*i.e*., intent upon pleasing her mind.

‘*With the desire for sexual intercourse*,’ ‘*ratikāmyayā*,’ *i.e*., in
consideration of her wishes,—not by one’s own wish—one may approach her
with a view to the pleasures of sexual intercourse,—one who has already
got a son may do this during ‘season,’ and one who has not got a son may
do it out of season.

Or, the pronoun ‘*tat*’ (in ‘*tadvrataḥ*’) may be construed with
‘*ratikāmyayā*;’ such irregular construction being permissible, in view
of the work being a text-book of *Smṛti*. The meaning in this case would
be—‘with a view to giving *her* pleasure, he may approach her at other
times also, except on the sacred days.’ And in this case, we might
assume the presence of an ‘a,’ the term being ‘*aratikāmyayā*’—*i.e*.,
‘*not* with a view to giving pleasure to himself.’ But in the
explanation that has been given before, there would be no use for
assuming this ‘a,’ nor for construing the pronoun ‘*tat*’ apart from its
context.

The ‘*sacred days*’ shall be described later on (4. 128) as—‘the
moonless day, the eighth day, the full-moon day and the fourteenth day.’

‘*Attached to his own wife*’—*i.e*, one should be ever bent upon
satisfying her. Or, it may be taken as the prohibition of having
recourse to others’ wives, the meaning being—that ‘one should love one’s
own wife, and should never make love to the wife of another person.’

‘*Ever*’—throughout life one should observe this rule.

Thus the conclusion is that the present verse contains three
statements.—(1) the first is that ‘one should approach one’s wife during
season,’ which only reiterates a rule already laid down elsewhere for
one who has not yet got a son; (2) the second statement is that ‘when
urged by one’s wife, one should approach her with a view to sexual
intercourse, during season as well as out of season, except on the
sacred days;’ (3) and the third is that ‘one should be attached to one’s
own wife only.’ The verbal construction would be (*a*) ‘one should
approach one’s wife during season,’ for the purpose of begetting
children; (*b*) ‘with a desire for sexual intercourse he should, in
consideration of her, approach her;’ (*c*) ‘he should be attached to his
own wife.’—(45)

(Nārāyaṇa). The *Parvas* are described in 4.128.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 497), which adds
the following explanation;—‘*Ṛtu*’, ‘season’, is the name given to the
period of sixteen days, counted from the first day of the menstrual
flow,—during which the woman is capable of conceiving;—during this
‘season’ one should always approach his wife for the purpose of
obtaining a child; and if is only his wife that the man should
approach;—but during the ‘season’ the ‘second days’ should be
avoided:—even apart from the season,one may approach his wife, when
specially desired by her.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 162), which explains
‘*tadvrataḥ*’ as ‘intent upon begetting a child’; and it is added that
what is meant is that ‘one should never omit to approach his wife during
her season’.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 558) quotes the verse and adds the following
notes:—‘*Ṛtu*’, ‘season’, denotes the woman’s capacity of conceiving;
and the time during which the capacity is present is called the ‘period
of the season’—‘*Tadvrataḥ*’ means ‘who is intent upon the
approaching’;—this approaching during the period beyond the ‘season’ is
sanctioned with a view to guarding the impassioned woman from going
astray.

This is quoted in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 724):—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 41), which explains ‘*tadvrataḥ*’ as ‘bent upon getting a
son’, and adds that the implication is that ‘during the period, even
though the man may not be keenly desirous of intercourse, yet he should
have recourse to his wife for the purpose of begetting a son’, as
otherwise he would be incurring a sin.

The verse is meant to provide a definition of ‘season;’ and what is
stated here is based upon medical science, not upon any scriptural
injunctions. Similarly, the two verses beginning with the
*forty-eighth*.

‘*Sixteen days*,’ in every month, constitute the ‘natural season’ for
women. That ‘every month’ is meant, we gather from other sources, though
it is not mentioned in this verse.

‘*Normal*’—what comes by nature; *i.e*., what happens in the case of
women in normal health; in cases of disease and such other causes, the
flow is absent even when the time has arrived; and by means of such
medicines as butter and sesamum, and so forth, or by excessive sexual
intercourse, the flow is brought on even before time. Hence the sixteen
days are called the ‘normal season.’

‘*Including the four days*’—the four days that are censured by all good
men, during which the touching of, and conversing with, the woman has
been prohibited; these are the four days beginning with the first day on
which the flow of blood becomes visible. ‘*Day*’ stands for ‘day and
night.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 437) in support of
the view that counting from the first day of the menses, sixteen days
constitute the ‘season’, of which the first four days are condemned by
good men.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 539) quotes this verse, and adds that the
addition of the term ‘*svābhāvikaḥ*’, ‘normal,’ indicates that the
period may vary, on account of the presence of certain diseases and
other causes.

This verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 166);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 680), which adds that the specification of
‘night’ implies the prohibition of intercourse during the day;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 38).

‘*Of these*’—days—‘*the first four*’— beginning from the day on which
the blood is first seen—‘*have* *been deprecated*,’—*i.e*., there should
be no intercourse on those days. On the first three days, even touching
is prohibited, the woman being impure on those days; on the fourth day,
when she has bathed,—though, according to the words of Vaśiṣṭha, she is
pure—there is to be no sexual intercourse; all the four days being
equally deprecated (for that purpose).

‘*The eleventh and the thirteenth*’ days also ‘have been
deprecated,’—*i.e*., on those days also intercourse has been forbidden.
The ‘eleventh’ and the ‘thirteenth’ days are those counted from the
first day of the flow; they do not stand for the two dates of the month;
because the genitive ending in ‘*tāsām*,’ ‘of these,’ signifies
*selection*; and, as the pronoun stands for ‘days,’ it must be the same
thing (day) that is *selected*; just as in the expression, ‘of cows, the
black one gives most milk.’

This prohibition of intercourse on the said six days is with a view to a
transcendental result.

‘*The remaining ten days have been recommended*,’—(of the sixteen days)
six days having been forbidden, the commendation of the remaining ten
days follows naturally; and it is this same natural conclusion that is
reiterated here.—(47)

‘*Seed*’—the man’s semen, and the woman’s ovule. Says the revered
Vaśiṣṭha—‘man is the product of semen and ovule’ (15.1).

When the man’s ‘seed’ is in excess of the woman’s, then, even on the
uneven days, a male child is conceived; similarly, on the even days also
a female child becomes conceived, if the woman’s ‘seed’ happens to be in
excess.

This statement is meant to lead the man seeking for a son to have
intercourse with his wife on the uneven days also; the sense of the
instruction being that—when the man finds that by the use of
aphrodisiacs and strengthening food he has become vigorous in his
virility, and that his wife has, for some reason or other, become weak,
then he should have intercourse with her, when desirous of getting a
son.

The ‘*excess*’ meant here is not that in *quantity*, but that in
*virility*.

*When the two are equal*, *there in burn either a non-male*, *or a boy*
and a *girl, together*. ‘*Non-male*’ stands for the hermaphrodite,
according to some people.

Some people read ‘*sāmye*;’ and it means that ‘in case of equality of
both, a non-male is born.’

‘*Or a boy and a girl*’—When the wind in the womb stirs up the mixed
semen and ovula and divides it into two equal parts—a small quantity in
-one part, and an equal quantity in another part of the womb,—then twins
are born; and in those two equal parts also, in that part where the
woman’s seed happens to be in excess the girl is born, while in the
other part, where the male’s seed is in excess, the boy is born.

When the seed is weak—in virility—then ‘*there is failure*;’ either
non-conception, or the birth of a hermaphrodite.—(49)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 499), which remarks
that in the second line the words are ‘*same apumān*’;—and in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 617).

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 160) quotes this verse and adds the
following notes:—‘*Śukra*’ in the man’s case is semen; and in that of
the woman, the red ovule;—Vaśiṣṭha has declared that the human body is
made up of the semen and the ovule;—if the man’s seed happens to be in
excess of the woman’s, then the child is male, even though the sexual
intercourse might have taken place on an odd day of the period; but with
this difference that the male child born under such circumstances would
have an effeminate body;—in the event of the woman’s seed being in
excess of the man’s the child is female, even though the intercourse
might have taken place on an even day of the period; but in this case
the female child would have a masculine body;—and the reason for this
mixed character consists in the fact that the effect of the seed, which
is the material cause of the child’s body, is more potent than that of
the time of conception, which is only a ‘concomitant cause’;—when the
two seeds are in equal quantity, the child is either ‘non-male’ *i.e*.,
a eunuch, or a boy and girl—*i.e*., twins,—this latter being caused by
the bifurcation of the seed at the time of emission, leading to two
portions of it falling on two different parts of the womb.

The verse is also quoted in the *Āhnika* section (p. 559) of
*Vīramitrodaya* where we find the following notes:—

‘*Same*’—when the man’s seed and the woman’s are equal—there is born
either a non-male, a eunuch, or ‘a boy and girl’;—the seeds being
bifurcated into two parts in.equal quantities, twins, consisting of one
boy and one girl, are born;—‘*Kṣīṇe*’—when the seed is weak,—and
‘*alpe*’—small in quantity, there is ‘*viparyaya*’—failure of
conception.

This is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 16), which adds that if the
intercourse takes place on an ‘even’ day but the proportion of the
woman’s ‘seed’ is larger, then the child will be a female one, but with
masculine features; and if it takes place on an odd day and the
proportion of the man’s ‘seed’ is larger, then the child will be a male
one, but with feminine features;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 683), which
explains ‘*apumān*’ as ‘sexless’ and there are two children, one male
and another female, if the seed become divided;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p, 25a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 40) which
explains ‘*Same*’ as ‘when there is equality of the two-seeds,’ and adds
the same notes as those in the *Mayūkha*.

‘*Forbidden days*’—*i.e*., the six mentioned above.

‘*Other eight days*’—which have not been forbidden.

He who avoids women on these days, and has recourse to her on the
remaining two days—avoiding the sacred days—then ‘*he remains a
religious student etc*.’—*i.e*., he obtains the fruits of continence.

‘*In whatever stage of life he may happen to be*,’—this is an
exaggeration. Certainly, intercourse with women on two days could never
be permitted for the Recluse; for the simple reason that it has been
strictly enjoined that one should keep one’s sexual organs in complete
check, in all stages of life, except that.of the Religious Student. As
for the repetition (in the phrase, ‘*yatra tatra*’), this is explicable
as occurring in an exaggerated statement.

The text does not menu that the fourteen days are to be avoided in the
order in which they are mentioned; all that is meant is that one should
not think that one may have intercourse whenever one chooses, only
leaving off the sacred days; and it is in this sense that only two days
have been permitted.

“What is the fruit of *continence*?”

Since we do not find any particular fruit mentioned (as resulting from
continence), it must be taken to be Heaven. But in some places we find
it asserted that ‘the student observing the vow of continence never
incurs sin;’ which means that he is not tainted by sins accruing from
minor transgressions.

‘*Yatra tatrāśrame vasan*’—‘In whatever life-stage he may be’; *i.e*.,
‘whether he be a householder or a hermit *Vānaprastha*’ (Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa).—According to Medhātithi, this is a mere *arthavāda*, and what
is said does not apply to any one except the householder;—Govindarāja
does not, like Kullūka, restrict the extension to the Hermit
(*Vānaprastha*) only, he includes the Renunciate (*Yati*) also. Buhler
remarks that ‘Kullūka justly ridicules the last opinion’; but Kullūka’s
own opinion is only a shade less ridiculous than Govindarāja’s. (See the
following note, for a good explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 559), where the
foilwing notes are added:—‘*Nindyāsu rātriṣu*’—on the first four days,
the, eleventh day and the thirteeenth day;—‘*anyāsu ratriṣu*—on any
other eight days from among those not forbidden;—if one avoids
women,—*i.e*, approaching them only on two days,—the man remains ‘a
continent religious Student’;—*i.e*., he derives the results obtainable
by continence;—‘*Yatra tatrāśrame*’—*i.e*., even though he is a
Householder, he gets all that is obtainable by the chaste Student.
