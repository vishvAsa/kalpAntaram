The right definition of the ‘guest’ shall he given later on (in 102);
when such a guest has arrived, he shall feed him *first*,—*i.e*., before
all others that may be near the house and may be going to eat.

*Alms to one who is a mendicant*’—*i.e*., he should give it to a person
that asks for it. The term ‘*alms*’ stands for the gift of a small
quantity of food; it has been said that ‘it is a handful that
constitutes *alms*;’ and this is well known among housewives.

‘*In the proper form*,’ to ‘*a Brahmacārin*’—to others even to a beggar
that may be a disguised heretic, alms may be given,—but not in the
proper form; but to the Brahmacārin it should be given ‘*in the proper
form*;’ *i.e*., the giving is to be preceded by the syllable ‘*svasti*’
by the *recipient*; this is the ‘form’ referred to.

Or, the term ‘*bhikṣu*,’ ‘mendicant,’ in the text may be taken in the
sense of the *Parivrāṭ*, the Renunciate,—and the term ‘*brahmacārī*’ in
that of one who is still in the first stage of *Studentship*. The
particle ‘*ca*’ occurs in the wrong place on account of exigencies of
metre; it should occur after ‘*brahmacārine*.’

But under this explanation, no alms would ever be given to the Recluse
(the person in the third stage.) Hence the right view appears to be to
take the term ‘*bhikṣu*’ (mendicant) in the sense of ‘one who begs,’ and
the term ‘*brahmacārin*’ (*chaste*) as a qualification of the former.
And in this way the giving of alms to persons in all the three stages
becomes regularly sanctioned. As for heretics, they are to be treated
like outcasts (*vide* 92),—and the mention of ‘all’ (in 93) has already
enjoined the helping in the form of giving food, according to one’s
means, to all living beings.—(94)

‘*Bhikṣave brahmacāriṇe*’—‘To the Religious Student who begs for it’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘to the Remmciate *and* to the Religious
Student’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda; also suggested, but disapproved, by
Medātithi);—‘the chaste beggar’ (*third* suggestion by Medhātithi and
approved on the ground that it includes all the three,—the Student, the
Hermit and the Remmciate).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
392) as laying down that the feeding of the guests is to be done after
the Bali-offerings; but adds that this is meant for those cases where
the *Śrāddha* is not performed, as in the case of the Householder who
has his father still living;—also on p. 434, where it explains that what
is meant by ‘*Pūrvamāśayet*’, ‘should feed *first*’, is that the feeding
should be done *before the Nityaśrāddha*, and applies to those cases
where the ‘guest’ happens to arrive at that exact time.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.3-5).—‘One shall make Bali-offerings to the Household
deities; hiving offered a share to the Vedic scholar or to toe religious
student, who may have arrived, he shall make the offering to the Pitṛs;
then he shall feed the guests, in order of seniority; and then the
members of his own household.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.108).—‘Alms should be given, with due honour, to the
recluse firm in his vow; and he shall feed only friends and relations as
might arrive at the time.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.14).—‘Alms shall be given to the recluse.’

*Pāraskara* (2.9.12).—‘Food shall be distributed among the recluses and
the guests, in due order.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.5.14).—‘The Praṇava, the Vyāhṛtis and the Sāvitrī
constitute the five Great Sacrifices, which purify the Brāhmaṇa day
after day; purified by these five Sacrifices, he makes offerings to the
gods.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.6.5).—‘Day after day he shall offer to Brāhmaṇas food
containing also roots, fruits and vegetables; thereby he accomplishes
the Sacrifice to human beings.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.7.19).—‘First of all he shall feed the guests, then such
ladies of the house as may he carrying; and then, with special care, the
children, the old persons and those that may be ill.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.11).—‘He shall feed the guests first of
all.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika. pp. 429-430).—‘After having made
the Bali-offerings be shall stay in the court-yard, expecting guests,
till the cows are milked; when a guest has arrived, he shall welcome him
with due honour, regarding him as Hiraṇyagarbha; at least one other
Brāhmaṇa the Householder shall feed in honour of his father.’

*Parāśara* (Do.).—‘He shall not ask the guest either his *gotra* or his
Vedic Rescension or the extent of his Vedic study.’

*Vyāsa* (Do.).—‘If a *Bhikṣuka*, seeker for alms, comes before the
offerings have been made to the Viśvedevas, the Householder shall keep
aside food enough for these offerings, and give the food to the seeker
for alms. The Religious Student, the Renunciate, the Student seeking for
knowledge, one who is supporting his preceptor, the way-farer and one
who is suffering from want of livelihood,—these are to be regarded as
*Bhikṣuka*, seeker for Alms.’

That une should always give food to one in want of it, according to his
means—(having been declared in the preceding verses), the present verse
supplies another incentive.

The reward that one obtains by giving a cow to the Teacher is obtained
by giving alms ; *i.e*., it does not differ in any way from that of the
giving of a cow. In another *Smṛti*, the giving of the cow has been
described as buying ‘all rewards,’ and also as ‘freeing from all sins.’
Whenever a text declares that same rewards follow from the rendering of
small help und of greater help, we should understand that there will be
a difference in the quantity, as there is in ordinary life. That is, the
same reward is obtained, but it does not continue for an equally long
time. \[There must be some such difference\] for there is the well-known
maxim—‘what wise man will buy with ten pice a thing that can be obtained
for only one?’ If the results in the two casus were really *equal* in
all respects, then there would be no use in undertaking the work that
requires u greater effort.

Some people read ‘*gāndatvā guryathāvidhi*’ (‘by the person without cows
giving a cow’); and in this case, the negative particle (in the compound
‘*aguḥ*,’ ‘without cows’) means *few*; *i.e*., one who possesses only a
few cows.

‘*Merit*’ is meritorious act; the reward of this.—(95)

*Viṣṇu* (67.28, 32, 44, 46).—‘By honouring the guest, one obtains the
highest reward: by worshipping him, he attains heaven; neither by Vedic
Study, nor by Agnihotra, nor by sacrifices and Purāṇas does the
Householder attain those regions which he attains by the honouring of
the guest; shelter, bed, oiling of the feet and light, by giving to the
guest each one of these, one obtains the same reward that one does by
giving a cow.’

It has been said above that the alms is to be given ‘in the proper
form;’ and this form is now described.

The mention of the ‘water-pot,’ which has not been referred to in this
context before, is meant to indicate that in all cases one need not
always give *alms* only.

‘*Having honoured*,’—after having worshipped.

‘*Vidhipūrvakam*,’—‘*in accordance with scriptural injun*
*ctions*’—means ‘that which has scriptural injunctions for its
precedent;’ the term ‘precedent’ meaning *reason*; the compound
therefore means that what is here stated is on the basis of scriptural
injunctions.

Or, the term ‘*vidhi*’ may stand for *method*; the sense being that the
right, method should be adopted first; the method being that ‘he should
be honoured,’ as already mentioned.

‘*The true meaning of the Veda*’—the real, the undoubted, sense of the
Veda; he who knows this meaning—to such a Brāhmaṇa one should ‘make
over’ the things.

The term ‘*to the Brāhmaṇa*’ restricts the gift to the particular caste;
and the term ‘*knowing*, &c.’ restricts it to persons possessing a
certain qualification.

Hence, in connection with the act of giving, three things are enjoined
here—

1.  ‘whatever is to be given should be given to the Brāhmaṇa,’
2.  ‘to a Brāhmaṇa who knows the meaning of the Veda,’
3.  and ‘only after having honoured him,’

And this multiplicity of injunctions (in a single verse) (though
inadmissible in a Vedic text) may be admissible in the work of a human
author.

The next, verse proceeds to point out the danger in connection with the
act of ‘giving’ enjoined above.—(96).

‘*Satkṛtya*’—‘Having honoured’ (the Brāhmaṇa) (Medhātithi and

the guest, Agni is pleased; by the offer of food, Indra; by washing his
feet, the Pitṛs; and by feeding him, Prajāpati.’

*Śātātapa* (Do., p. 435).—‘The alms offered should be either *Bhikṣā*
(*i.e*., enough for one meal), or *Puṣkala* (enough for four meals); or
*Hantakāra* (enough for sixteen meals); if none of these is possible
then only a pot of water.’

pronounce the syllable *svasti*,—it is excellent.’

The preceding verse has described the person to whom presents are to be
made; the present verse proceeds to prohibit the giving of presents to
unqualified persons.

‘*Become lost*’—become fruitless.

‘*Rites in honour of the gods*’—Such acts as the feeding of Brāhmaṇas
and the like, which are done in honour of the gods.

‘*Rites in honour of the Pitṛs*’—those that form part of the acts done
in honour of one’s ancestors; *i.e*., *Śrāddhas*.

‘*Ash-like*—those who hav *become ashes* are called ‘*bhasmabhūta*. Or,
the term ‘*bhūta*’ may mean *similarity*; hence the word ‘*bhasmabhūta*’
means ‘*ash-like*;’ just as in the compound ‘*kāṣṭhabhūta*.’

“What is the point of similarity between *ash* and the *Brāhmaṇas?*”

The meaning is that, just as the ash is of no use, and is mere refuse
and deserves only to be thrown away, so the Brāhmaṇa in question is to
be removed from all religious functions.

‘*Made by ignorant men*’— this is to be construed with ‘*become lost*.’

‘*Presented by givers through folly*’—‘ignorant’ and ‘folly’ are only
re-iterations. Anything that is prohibited in the scriptures is done
only through folly.

The next verse describes what sort of Brāhmaṇas are not ‘ash-like.’—(97)

</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

**(verses 3.97-98)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.9-11).—‘The *Havya* and offerings are to be offered to the
Vedic scholar only; what is offered to the non-learned reaches neither
the Pitṛs nor the gods; gifts should be offered to one who is extremely
learned; there is nothing Wrong in ignoring the uneducated. In the
presence of flaming fire, one should not pour libations on ashes.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.201, 202).—‘Cows, sesamum and gold should be given,
with due respects, to a qualified person; never should the wise man
desiring his own welfare make a gift to the unqualified. In fact, a man
devoid of learning and austerities should not accept any gift; if he
does accept them, he drags downwards both himself and the giver.’

*Vyāsa* (4.39,42,50,52,54,57).—‘If a man ignores the Brāhmaṇa student
near him, when offering food and gifts, he damages his merit extending
over three generations. Gift made to a non-Brāhmaṇa remains the same;
that made to the Brāhmaṇa becomes two-fold; that made to the Preceptor
becomes thousand-fold, and that made to the person learned in the Veda
becomes endless. The Brāhmaṇa’s mouth is the soil, fertile and free from
thorns; therein should one sow the seeds; such cultivation fulfils all
desires. When there comes to one’s house a Brāhmaṇa endowed with
learning and humility, all the herbs become delighted at the prospect of
(being eaten by him and thereby) reaching the highest state. One should
feed a mouth equipped with Veda, even though that person may have
already taken his food, rather than the illiterate person that may have
been fasting for six days. When the person learned in the Veda and
attentive to his duties takes his food, he brings to the giver rewards
endless and extending over many lives.’

*Āśvalāyana* (1.150).—‘If the good man offers food into the mouth of the
man learned in the Veda, he becomes freed from heinous sins, and attains
union with Brahman.’

Brāhmaṇas effulgent with learning and austerities, being unlike those
described above, are not ash-like. ‘*Effulgence*’ connotes superior
excellence; and persons are said to be ‘effulgent with learning and
austerities’ when they possess great learning and perform great
austerities. Though the ‘learning and austerities’ belong to the *entire
man*, yet here they are co-ordinated with ‘*mouth*,’ which is only a
part of the entire man; and such co-ordination is based upon indirect
connection \[the mouth being connected with the man, who is connected
with learning and austerities.\]

In the compound ‘*vipramukhāgni*,’ the *mouth* is likened to *fire*;
hence the compound falls within the ‘*vyāghrādi*’ group (*vide* Pāniṇi
2. 1. 56).

Just as an oblation thrown into the fire bears fruit, but when it is
thrown on ash, it is fruitless; similarly, ‘oblation’ in the shape of
food thrown into the Brāhmaṇa’s month. This *food* by being called
‘oblation’ is meant to be highly eulogised; sacrifice, oblation and such
acts are well-known as bearing important fruits; hence the lesser known
act (feeding of Brāhmaṇas) has been likened to the said well-known acts.

‘*Saves from trouble*;’—‘‘*trouble*’ stands for the advent of illness,
enemies, suffering at the hands of the king, and so forth; from this it
‘*saves*,’ protects; *i.e*., the man is not affected by it.

‘*Also from great sin*;’—*i.e*., it saves also from falling into hell,
&c.

It is not only the gifts made in connection with auspicious rites that
are to be given to the recipient described; gifts in connection with
expiatory rites also should be given to Brāhmaṇas possessing the same
qualifications.—(98)

‘*That has happened to come*’—*i.e*., who has come of his own accord,
and has not been invited; one who has been invited is not a ‘guest.’ The
proper place where the guest is to arrive shall be described later
on—‘where the wife and the Fires are, &c., &c.’ (103).

‘*Water and seat he should offer*;’—first of all he should offer water
for the washing of his feet, and then the seat; ‘*and also food*.’

‘*Prepared to the best of his ability*;’—this qualifies ‘food.’ The
meaning is that he should prepare the food with special care and then
offer it—feed him with it.

‘*According to rule*’—*i.e*., that offering which is
preceded—supported—by injunction; *i.e*., that which is sanctioned by
scripture.—(99)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441), which explains
‘*samprāptāya*’ as ‘one who has happened to come of his own accord, *i*.
*e*., without invitation’; and ‘*vidhipūrvakam*’ as ‘in the manner
prescribed for the entertaining of guests’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 433).

Between verses 99 and 100, *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441) quotes the
following two additional verses—

> annaṃ hutvā vidhānena yatpuṇyaphalamaśanūte \|  
> tena tus?yaṃ viśiṣṭaṃ vā brāhmaṇe tarpite phalam \|\|  
> mantr?akarmaviparyāsād? duritād? durgatādapi \|  
> tatphalaṃ naśyate karturidaṃ na śraddhayā h?tam \|\|

and adds the following explanations:—‘*annam hutvā*’—*i*. *e*., in the
fire;—‘*mantra &c*.’.—*i.e*., ‘from that sin which would accrue from the
misuse of Mantras and Rites, and from the delinquencies of the
Agent’;—‘*tatphalam*’—the result following from the Homa;—‘*Idam
na*’—the construction is that ‘whatever is offered to the guest with due
respect, in the shape of all this, seat and the rest, is never lost’.

*Gautama*. (5.32.34).—‘To the guest not learned in the Veda, water for
washing the feet, an offering of water and also special kinds of food,
always specially cooked.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.12).—‘When a person comes to his house, he should welcome
him, rising from his seat and offering him a seat and a bed, and
receiving him with true and agreeable words, free from jealousy.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.13-16).—‘The master and mistress of the
house should not refuse to receive anyone who comes to seek for anything
at the proper time; if they have nothing else to offer, they should
offer a place, water, grass and agreeable words.........To a Brāhmaṇa
not learning or learned in the Veda, he shall only offer seat, water and
food and he shall not rise to receive him.’

*Āpastamba* (6.7-14 ).—‘ Having gone up before him, and having met him,
he shall offer to him a seat...... He shall wash his feet; some people
hold that it is only the Śūdra householder and his wife that are to do
this... He shall offer to him water in an earthen vessel, say some...
But if the guest is one who has completed his study, no water is to be
offered to him......... Having pleased him, he shall satisfy him with
sweetly flavoured food.’ \[So on, there are very full directions.\]

*Viṣṇu* (67.45).—‘In the morning and in the evening, he shall offer to
the guest both seat and water, as also food to the best of his power,
after having received him with honour.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.107).—‘To the guest one should make offerings to the

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Even for one who is extremely poor it is not right to omit the honouring
of the guest.

‘*Harvest-droppings*’— Ears of corn dropped in the fields after
harvesting.

‘*Gathering*’—Collecting.

This is meant to indicate difficulty of livelihood in general.

‘*Offers oblations into the five fires*.’

What is meant by this is that, even if the householder is one who obeys
all the injunctions of the scriptures, and he is also poor, and
(therefore) does not honour, with food &c., the guest that happens to
arrive,—then the said strict observance of the laws of livelihood
becomes fruitless. Hence (it is said) that the guest ‘*takes away all
his merit*’—*i.e*., nullities it;—if he ‘*stays unhonoured*.’ Hence one
should honour the guest—this is the meaning of the injunction.

The term ‘*slays*’ indicates that the injunction pertains to one who
arrives in the evening.

The ‘*five fires*’ are—The ‘Tretā’ (Three Sacrificial Fires), (4) the
‘*Gṛhya*’ (Domestic Fire) and (5) the ‘*Sabhya*’ (Social Fire).

“What is the fire called ‘*sabhya*,’ Social’?”

They offer the following explanation:—When one goes to another village,
and cooks his food in the ordinary fire;—or, in the house of a rich man
fire is lighted in several rooms for the alleviation of cold,—this is
what is called the ‘*sabhya*,’ ‘social’, ‘fire’.

“In that case, what is the *oblation* that would be offered in such a
fire? Since the rule is that⁽the *gṛhya* oblations are to be offered in
that fire (which is set up after marriage or after succession)’ \[
*Gautama* 5.7 & 8\]”.

On the strength of the present verse itself they say that, when the man
is away from home, he may offer the Vaiśvadeva oblations in the ordinary
fire also; and they quote the Smṛti-text—‘wherever one happens to see a
well-lighted flaming fire, he should offer into it oblations of dry
paddy, or of *vrīhi* and *yava*.’

Our revered teachers, however, offer the following explanation:—It is in
the Upaniṣads that the⁽science of the Five Fires’ has been described;
these five forms of fire have been assumed; and what is called
‘oblation’ here is the act of recognising the fire and worshipping it in
those forms. This worshipping has been recognised as leading to results
superior to those accomplished by means of all the *Śrauta* rites. In
connection with this, it has been declared that—‘the theft of gold, the
drinking of wine, having intercourse with the teacher’s wife and one who
kills the Brāhmaṇa,—all these four are fallen, as also one who has
relations with these \[ and even these sins are purified by the
knowledge of the science of Five Fires\].’

The result of all these five becomes lost if the guest is not honoured
and is sent away; this exaggerated praise is meant to convey the idea
that the said honouring of the guest is absolutely necessary.

In connection with the morning breakfast also there is the rule that the
guest should be fed; but the omission of it in the evening entails the
penalty of a higher expiatory site.

Some people do not take the phrase ‘to the best of his ability’ in the
preceding verse as applying to the ‘food; and they assert the meaning to
be that ‘guests should be honoured to the best of one’s ability—*i.e*.,
one or two or many (as many as one can).’—(100)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 355) in support of
the view that—‘if a guest comes to one’s house with a view to getting
food, and goes away without getting any, then all the rites that the
master of the house performs, in honour of the Gods and the Pitṛs,
become futile.’

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441), which adds the
following explanations:—‘*Śilāt*’ (which is the reading it adopts)—‘from
the remnant of the gleanings dropped in the
fields.’—‘*uñchataḥ*’—‘pickings’;—what is meant is that even a poor man
should entertain his guest.
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Viṣṇu* (67.33).—‘If a guest goes away disappointed from the home of any
person, he leaves behind him all his sins and takes away all the merit
of that householder.’

*Parāśara* (1.45.46).—‘If a guest goes away from one’s house
disappointed, his Pitṛs do not partake of anything in that house for
fifteen years. If one disappoints a guest, one’s libations are futile,
even though made with a thousand loads of fuel and a hundred jars of
butter.’

*Mahābhārata-Āśvamedhika* (Parsāharamādhava, p. 355).—‘One may study,
day after day, the Vedas and the subsidiaries, if he honours not his
guest, all study becomes futile. He who honours not the guest arrived
after the Viśvadeva offering, immediately becomes a Caṇḍāla. If a man
turns out a guest from his house, arrived at the right time and place,
he becomes an outcast at that very moment.’

If, through poverty, one is unable to provide food,—even then one should
not entertain such thoughts as these—‘feeding is the chief factor in the
honouring of a guest; this is not possible in my case; why then should I
let him enter my house?’ Because for one who is incapable of doing
anything else, even the providing of ‘grass,’ &c., would constitute the
act of ‘honouring the guest.’ Or, the meaning may be that the providing
of food alone does not constitute the full compliance with the
injunction of ‘honouring the guest;’ one has to provide bedding, &c.,
also.

‘*Grasses*’—stands for *bedding*.

‘*Place*’—*i.e*., space for sitting, sleeping and moving about.

‘*Kind words*’—*i.e*., words, sweet as well as wholesome; in the form of
conversation and stories, &c.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘Then he should feed the guests in the order of
seniority.’

*Mahābhārata* (Āśvamedhika, Do., p. 441).—‘If a twice-born person
studies the Vedas along with all the subsidiaries, but does not honour
the guests, he studies it all in vain...... If a man honours not the
guest arriving after the Vaiśvadeva offerings, he, without doubt,
becomes a Caṇḍāla.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Āśvamedhika, pp. 442-443).—‘The guest, who is a Vedic
scholar or a religious student preparing for householdership, or a
life-long religious student, or a renunciate,—should observe the milking
time. If such a guest arrives at that time, one should receive him and
then take his food. If the householder takes his food before the guest
has been fed, the latter lakes away all his merit. That is why they
honour the guest........ To the guest who is fully endowed with age,
caste, learning, and austerity, he shall offer water for washing the
feet and for rinsing the mouth, and also food to the best of his power;
he should sit with him, and at night should retire to sleep after having
obtained his permission; he should rise, in the morning, before the
guest; and when he departs, he should accompany him up to either a
sacrificial altar or a garden or a park or a public hall or a watering
place or a tank or a temple or a place of large gatherings; and there
having greeted him according to the law, he shall come hack, having
requested him to come again.’

*Parāśara* (Do., p. 443).—‘If a guest arrives, ho should receive him
with welcome, the offering of a seat and also the washing of his feet;
as also with offering him food with due respect, and with agreeable
conversation; and he should please him by accompanying him when he
departs.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘Duty towards the guest is five-fold—one should offer him
one’s eye, mind, true and agreeable words, rising to welcome and
offering a seat.’

*Parāśara* (Do., p. 448).—‘Those who fail to make the Vaiśvadeva
offerings, and those who do not fulfil their obligations to the
guest,—all these go to hell and come to be horn as crows.’

*Mahābhārata* (Āśvamedhika, Do.).—‘Be the guest a *Caṇḍāla* or a
*Śvapāka* or a Kāleya, if he has come in time, he should he welcomed by
the householder.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Do.).—‘Be he a *Caṇḍāla*, or a sinner or an enemy or
a patricide, if he has arrived at the proper time and place, he should
be fed.’

*Hārīta* (Do., p. 449).—‘If a guest arrives,—be he a recluse or a
householder or an accomplished student,—to him he shall offer welcome,
water for washing the feet and rinsing the mouth, and seat; as also all
the vegetables that may be available; when he departs, he should go with
him; thus do his forefathers become pleased; and he should turn hack
only when permitted to do so by the guest; if he however stays at the
house, he should be duly attended upon.’
