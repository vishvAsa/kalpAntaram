‘*Friend*’— Companion; they of whom the friend is the first. The term
‘*and the rest*’ connotes *kind*, and includes relations, associates,
class-fellows, and so forth;—all except the Teacher.

‘*That may come out of affection*,’—The context pertaining to the
*guest*, the term ‘*affection*,’ has been added with a view to preclude
that character.

‘*He should feed them*.’

‘*Specially prepared*’—Having cooked the food with special care.

‘*To the best of his ability*;’—the term ‘ability’ is meant to be merely
illustrative; the meaning is that the cooking and the seasoning should
be in accordance with the man’s own ability, and also according to what
each guest may deserve.

‘*Together with his wife*’—the time for the wife’s eating is the same as
the husband’s; no time being laid down specifically for the wife; all
that is said is that ‘the husband and Wife should eat the remnant’
(verse 116). In the Mahābhārata, however, it is shown that the wife eats
after the husband: In the course of conversation between Draupadī and
Satyabhāmā, Draupadī, describing the duties of the wife, has said—‘after
all my husbands have eaten, I eat what is left’. The eating of food left
by the husband is among the wife’s duties. Hence, what is here laid down
is not that the Friend and others should eat at the time that, the wife
eats; nor does the phrase ‘*along with*’ mean that, they are to eat out
of the same dish. All that is, meant is that they should not be fed
alone; the housewife also should eat there. This might go against the
rule that ‘the husband and wife should eat what is left,’ What is meant
is that if some respectable person is to be waited for, or if the
husband feels disinclined to eat, then the husband may not eat with the
Friend, etc., and in his place his wife should eat; this will bear
testimony to his friendly feelings towards the diners.—(113)

The term ‘*Suvāsinī*’ stands for newly married girls, daughters as well
as daughters-in-law. Others have held that ‘girls whose father-in-law
and father are both living are called *Suvāsinī*, even after they have
given birth to children.’

‘*These......immediately after the guests*’—in continuation of them—‘*he
should feed*.’ That is, as soon as the guests have commenced eating,
they should be fed at the same time.

Others read ‘*agre*’ ‘*before*’ (the guests).

‘*Without hesitation*’—*i.e*., he should not entertain any doubt as to
the propriety of feeding youngsters before the guests have eaten.—(114)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Suvāsinīḥ*’—‘Newly married girls *i.e*., daughters and
daughters-in-law’ (Medhātithi);—‘women whose fathers and fathers-in-law
are living, even though they may have got children’ (‘others,’ quoted by
Medhātithi).

‘*Agre*’—‘Before (the guests)’ (Kullūka);—Medhātithi adopts the reading
‘*anvak*’ and explains it to mean ‘along with (the guests)’; and not as
‘even if they come later,’ as Hopkins interprets him.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455), which explains
‘*agre*’ as ‘first’;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 147).

‘*Before giving food to these*’—*i.e*., to those just mentioned,
beginning with the guest and ending with the servant—‘*the foolish
man*’— who does not know the law—‘*eats*’— is devoured, after death, by
dogs and vultures.

This ‘*being devoured*’—being eaten—by them, he does not understand. The
foolish man simply feels that ‘I am eating now,’ and he does not
understand that his eating in this manner means the eating of his own
body by dogs and vultures. This latter is the result of such eating;
hence it has been thus described.—(115)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455) without
comment; and also on p. 395, where it is explained as setting aside the
view that the *Vaiśvadeva* and *Bali* offerings should be made only once
in the morning when the man himself eats,—and as indicating the
necessity of making them both in the morning and in the evening, *even
though the man himself may not eat* at both times. There is this
difference, however, that if the man omits the offerings while he
himself eats, he incurs two sins—that of eating without offering, and
that of omitting the offerings; whereas if he drops them when he himself
does not eat, he incurs only one sin, that of omitting the offerings.
Thus on the *Ekādaśī* and other fasting days also, the said offerings
have got to be made; and food has got to be cooked for that purpose; but
in the event of his being unable to do the cooking, the offerings may be
made even with uncooked food.

This is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 147), which explains the second
line to mean ‘he does not understand that he is himself being devoured
by dogs and vultures’, and deduces the conclusion that it is not sinful
to eat along with the persons mentioned in the preceding verse.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is a mere reiteration of the foregoing injunction of the
performance of the Five Sacrifices, and of the time for the
Householder’s eating.

Others, however, have explained this verse its actually laying down
something different: The former verse has laid down the eating of
remnants by both husband and wife; while this verse leaves aside the
woman and lays down the eating by the man alone. And from this it would
follow that the wife should eat before the servants and before also the
husband. In this way, this becomes reconciled also with what has been
said before (113) regarding ‘the feeding of friends, &c., together with
the wife.’ Otherwise, if we assumed the latter to mean that the wife
should not eat with them, we would be abandoning the most palpable
construction of the sentence. As for what has been described in the
*Mahābhārata* (regarding Draupadī eating *after* her husbands), that is
a mere description, not an injunction. Even if it were an injunction, it
could only be regarded as laying down an option.

This, however, is not right; as the present verse is a mere reiteration.

Nor is there any incompatibility of the singular number in
‘*householder*’ (with the idea that both husband and wife are meant);
because in all things the Husband and wife operate conjointly; so that
their *companionship* being the prime factor, the use of the Dual member
does not become necessary. Just as in the text, ‘the Brāhmaṇa should set
up the fire,’ even though the husband and wife have got to perform the
rite jointly, yet there is no incongruity in the singular number. And
why so? Because one of the two is the principal and the other is
subordinate; and the subordinate cannot impose its number. Hence it is
that the principal being one only, though the wife also comes in in
fulfilment of her husband’s purpose, yet the singular number is the
right form to use. The single word ‘householder’ denotes the *wife*
also; and this is ip view of the joint functioning of the husband and
wife; and this is possible only when both are conceived of jointly, and
not if either both are regarded as *principal*, or both are regarded as
subordinate. From all this it follows that the wife is not to eat before
her husband; which establishes the conclusion that this verse is only a
reiteration, intended to lend strength to the conviction (arising from
the foregoing injunctions).

Some people have explained that, in the clause, ‘he should worship the
household deities,’ the term ‘deities’ is only a laudatory re-iteration;
and on account of its connection with the injunctive verb ‘should
worship,’ the sentence contains an injunction of the worshipping as a
subordinate factor. And they argue thus—“The primary denotation of the
term ‘deity’ is not compatible with the act of worshipping; as the
‘deity’ in the primary sense can only be related to the acts of
*sacrificing* and *hymning*. It is for this reason that the text has
added the epithet ‘*household*,’—which means *those in the house*; and
these can only be in the form of images. As those to whom sacrifices are
offered can have no connection with the house.”

For these people also what is to be taken in the secondary sense is the
‘*deity*,’ not the ‘worshipping.’

But why all this? The simple explanation is that the deities to whom
sacrificers offer sacrifices are called ‘*house* - *hold* deities’—(117)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*He eats only sin*’—*i.e*., he accumulates sin in his heart; he places
that in his stomach, and not even a morsel of food;—‘*who cooks*’—gets
food prepared —‘*for himself*’—for his own eating; giving such
directions as—‘I am hungry, and I prefer such and such food; hence cook
these.’ Hence one should not have food cooked for himself, except when
he is in distress. When, one is in distress, then it is incumbent upon
him—in accordance with another injunction—to maintain his body, even at
the risk of disobeying a certain injunction; specially in view of the
law that ‘one should guard oneself against all.’

Such is the meaning attributed to this verse by some persons. But this
is not right; being contrary to another *Smṛti* text, which
says—‘whatever may be best, liked in this world, and whatever may be
most loved in the house, that should be given to the qualified person,
by one who wishes that thing to be inexhaustible.’ Now, if what is best
liked by the householder were not cooked, how could it be given to
others?

What the text means, therefore, is as follows:—So far as the daily
cooking is concerned, it is not with special reference to any person; it
is only when friends and relations turn up that special things are
cooked for them. If it were not so, then there would be no force in the
injunction of giving food to guests and others out of the food that has
not been cooked for any person in particular. What is meant is that the
evil mentioned in the verse attaches to one who eats food without
offering it to the guest, &c.—or that, in the event of all the food
cooked being eaten up by the guest and others, the

Householder shall not have more food cooked only for himself. Vaśiṣṭha
has declared—‘the Husband and wife should eat the remnant; if the whole
has been eaten, cooking should not be done again.’ (11-11-12).

‘*The eating of the remains of sacrifices*;—this is only laudatory of
the ‘eating of what is left,’ enjoined above (in 117).

‘*Sacrifice*’—the Jyotiṣṭoma and the rest.

‘*Remains*’—what is left after use.—The ‘*eating*’ of this is called
‘*yajñaśiṣṭāśanam*’. Equal to this in its effects has been described the
eating—of what remains after the feeding of the guest and others,—of all
good householders, who are intent upon the obeying of the
scriptures.—(118)

*Viṣṇu* (67.43).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Baudhāyana* (2.7.16).—‘He who eats alone is entirely sinful; the food
he takes is futile.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 457).—‘He who cooks for himself eats
sin; one should always avoid that futile cooking which is intended only
to please his own palate.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika).—‘One shall not cook for himself,
nor shall he kill animals for himself; one who cooks for the sake of
gods and for the sake of Brāhmaṇas does not become tainted with sin.’

*Jābāla* (Do.)—‘He who eats without bathing, eats dirt; he who eats
without having repeated mantras, eats pus and blood; he who eats without
having offered Homa, eats insects; and he who eats food without offering
it to others, eats poison.’

118	He who prepares food for himself (alone), eats nothing but sin; for it is ordained that the food which remains after (the performance of) the sacrifices shall be the meal of virtuous men.
