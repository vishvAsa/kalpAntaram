<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Two kinds of Religious Students have been described above—the life-long
student and the student for a limited period. Verse 2.244—where it is
said that ‘he serves the Preceptor till the dissolution of his body’—has
described the life-long studentship; while verse 2.108—where the ‘Final
Return’ has been described as the limit—has indicated the other
alternative. As regards the ‘Life-long Student,’ the mention of the
name, itself, which is based upon reason, serves to indicate the limit
of the period of studentship; the term ‘*naiṣṭhika*’ meaning that which
goes to the very ‘*niṣṭhā*.’ or end of a thing; and the exact period has
been stated by the direct declaration that ‘it extends to the
dissolution of the body.’ As regards the ‘limited’ studentship, we have
the following texts bearing upon it:—(*a*) ‘by this course of
application etc.,’ (6. 85), (*b*) ‘the entire Veda should be acquired by
means of particular austerities and several observances prescribed by
Injunctions’ (2.165); and since these texts do not specify any
particular number of Vedas to be learnt, it would seem as if these
injunctions intended the pupil to learn one, two, three, four, five six,
seven or any other number of Vedic texts, in fact, as many as he could
learn. The present verse proceeds to restrict the number of Vedas to be
learnt.

‘*Duties relating to the Three Vedas should be observed*.’—‘*Relating to
the three Vedas*’ means ‘conducive to the learning of the three Vedas;’
the act of ‘learning’ being implied by the compound, on the strength of
the fact that the ‘getting up of the Veda’ has been presented
before.—‘*Duties*’—*i.e*., the whole lot of duties laid down for the
Religious Student,—‘*should be observed*’—one shall observe them; the
verbal affix having the injunctive force.

From the above it might be assumed that the duty of ‘fetching the fuel’
and the rest also should continue to be kept up only till the texts have
been got up (and no longer); and, in order to preclude this notion, the
text adds—‘*for thirty-six years*;’ which means that even after the Veda
has been got up, the full period has to be completed.

“If the detailed duties, that have been laid down are related to the
injunction of learning the Veda,—and this Injunction ceases to be
operative after the Veda has been learnt,—then why should the
observances of studentship be continued for twelve years, even after the
Veda has been learnt?”

What you say is too little. You might say the same in regard to the
performance, at the *Darṣa-pūrṇamāsa*, of all those secondary details
that come after the *Āgneya* and other primary offerings. The fact of
the matter is that, just as in the case of the sacrifice, the due result
is obtained only when the act is performed along with all its details,
so in the case in question also the fulfilment of the Injunction (of
Learning) is complete only after the act has been performed along with
all the details in the duly prescribed order.

“There are several lesser alternative periods—half, and quarter of the
full period—mentioned as the limit for study; and when these are
permitted, who is there who would keep up the observances, which require
such effort, for twelve years?”

Pupils, desirous of more extensive results, will have recourse to the
carrying out of the larger details. To this effect we have the
saying—‘when there is greater effort, there must follow larger results.’

“As a matter of fact, the learning of the Veda, through study, does not
lead to any other result except the understanding of the meaning of
Vedic texts. They say that—‘the revered Ritualists do not regal’d mere
learning as the result;’ and in the *Śabara-bhāṣya* also we read—‘the
purpose served by it has been found to consist in the comprehension of
what should be done.’ And certainly, there is no diversity (or divergent
grades) in the said comprehension.”

If that be so (if the comprehension of meaning were the sole end of
Vedic Study), then, inasmuch as such comprehension could come about at
the time of learning the Text, even without the keeping of any
observances, there should be no keeping of the observances at all. Then
again, who says that the Injunction of Vedic Study is for the purpose of
comprehending the meaning of Vedic texts? In fact, the Injunction of
Vedic Study is for the purpose of Vedic Study itself; there is no reason
for regarding one thing as being for. the purpose of another thing. As
for the comprehension of meaning, it follows after the Text Las been
learnt, by the very nature of things, and not by virtue of the
Injunction.

“Then, is the Injunction meant for one who desires Heaven?”

How can this also be possible?

“What, then, is the meaning of your assertion that there are larger
results obtained (when the act is performed along with more extensive
details)?”

The meaning of the statement is as follows:—The whole Injunction
prescribes a sanctiticatory process, in which ‘Vedic Study’ forms the
predominant factor, by reason of the sanctification being accomplished
during that ‘study.’ And Injunctions of sanctifications do not stand in
need of the direct mention of the result the seeker whereof would be
entitled to their performance; in fact, through the object sanctified,
they become part and parcel of another Injunction in connection with
which a particular result has been mentioned. For example, we have the
Injunction ‘the corns should be threshed and this ‘threshing’ becomes
related to the transcendental results proceeding from the
Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifices,—not by itself, but—only through the removal
of the chaff which goes to purify the corns of which is made the cake
used at the *Āgneya* and other offerings making up the
*Darśa-Pūrnamāsa*; and it is thus that the threshing comes to be
recognised as something to be done. In the same manner, the Veda cannot
be regarded as something to be sanctified or refined, except as
subordinate to something else. As a matter of fact, we find that the
comprehension of meaning actually follows after ‘Vedic Study from which
it follows that this act of ‘study’ itself extends up to the
comprehending of the meaning, just as the act of ‘threshing’ extends up
to the accomplishment of the Rice. The only difference in the two cases
is as follows:—By reason of its injunction occurring in the same
context, the ‘threshing’ becomes quickly recognised as related to
another Injunction mentioning a result; while the Injunction in question
(of Vedic Study) does not occur in the context of any particular act,
and is regarded as extending up to the comprehension of meaning; so that
its connection with results is only implied by the fact of its being of
use in the performance of all those acts that are enjoined as leading to
various results. Thus the fact that an Injunction aims at some useful
purpose of man is readily understood; and it makes no difference whether
it does so directly or indirectly. And since its connection with a
result is clearly implied, the Injunction in question gets itself
carried out independently by itself, even though the comprehension of
meaning is of use in connection with the injunctions of compulsory and
voluntary acts.

Some people have held the view that—“the injunction of Vedic Study
serves, through the comprehension of meaning, the same purpose as the
injunctions of the Jyotiṣṭoma and other acts, and that the additional
effort (involved in Vedic Study and comprehension of meaning) serves to
enhance the quality of the results brought about by those acts.” But
what fault has the Injunction of ‘becoming a Teacher’ done for those
people, that they should have made great efforts to deny the view that
this latter also serves the same purpose as the Injunction of ‘Vedic
Study?’ If it be urged that—“under this view, the Veda would become
unauthoritative,”—our answer is that, that might be so; but when a
certain fact is well established by reason and arguments, it is not
abandoned or rejected for the sake of accomplishing any purpose. In
fact, an argument is set aside only by another and a more cogent
argument.

“But if the Injunction of Vedic Study were taken as serving the same
purpose as that of ‘becoming a Teacher,’ then the former would lose its
injunctive character; as in that case no significance would attach to
what is expressed by its own words.”

The same thing happens also when the Injunction in question is made a
part and parcel of the Injunction of the Jyotiṣṭoma, etc.

If, on the other hand, the Injunction of Vedic Study is regarded as
independently by itself conducive to the carrying into effect of what it
enjoins, then, standing upon an equal footing with all other
Injunctions, it rightly comes to be acted up to by itself, as a
necessary factor (of all performances).

Thus then, out of the several alternative options—some heavier than the
rest—that have been set forth (in the verse), if the lighter alternative
serves to accomplish the desired purpose, all that the undertaking of
the heavier option can do is to add something to the quality of what has
been prescribed by the Injunction. Just as is the case with the options
of giving ‘one, three or twelve cows’ as a fee in connection with the
Laying of Fire. Thus then, if the Injunction of Study has been carried
into effect on its own accouut (and the Veda has been studied), we
cannot escape from its twofold relation—*viz*.: (1) its leading to the
performance of what it itself prescribes, and (2) its helping the
performance of the Jyotiṣṭoma and other acts; it matters little whether
such relation is directly stated, or implied, or assumed; for this
latter fact would involve a diversity only in the means whereby the
knowledge of the relation is obtained, and not any in the relation
itself.

“How is it that you are making statements, of which the succeeding ones
are inconsistent with the preceding ones? It has been asserted above
that Injunctions of sanctification are never directly related to
results; while now it is stated that the Injunction in question is by
itself conducive to itself being carried into effect. It might be urged
that—‘Though it is true that the Injunction of Sanctification is not
related to any directly mentioned result, yet there is nothing
incompatible in its being related to such results as are indirectly
indicated.’ But even this makes no difference, if the performanceof the
act (of Study), as prompted by the injunction in question, is made to
extend to the comprehension of meaning also. Even so, the mere learning
of the Text being got at in accordance with the Injunction of ‘having
recourse to a teacher &c.,’ it would become admitted that Injunctions of
sanctification are related to definite results. If, on the other hand,
the performance of the act (of study) were in accordance with the
Injunction as helping other Injunctions (*i.e*., those of the Jyotiṣṭoma
and other acts), then, in that case, it would come to this that the Veda
would be studied by one seeking after the stated result, and not that
the person who has studied the Veda is entitled to the performance of
acts leading to that result; and in that case, the Shudra’s title could
not be denied. Nor does it necessarily follow that the meaning of Vedic
texts should be learnt immediately after the texts have been learnt. In
fact, whenever one might, by chance, come to understand that ‘a certain
Vedic act, named Jyotiṣṭoma, leads to Heaven,’ he would learn the
details of the procedure of that act, and at that same time he would
also read up such Vedic texts related to that act as would have to be
recited by the sacrificer.”

To the above, some people make the following answer, on the basis of the
principle enunciated in Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā—Sutra 4.1. 18 *et. seq*. The
*Sviṣṭakṛt* and other similar offerings have been regarded as being of
both kinds, serving the purposes of sanctification and also leading to
specific results; and, on the same analogy, ‘Vedic Study’ also would be
of both kinds—being purely sanctificatory, as indicated by the words of
the Injunction prescribing it, and also leading to particular results,
by virtue of its bringing about the comprehension of the meaning of
texts which ultimately leads to the performance of acts (directly
bringing about those results). It is in this manner that the Injunction
of Vedic Study becomes conducive to definite results.

“But who is the person to whom the results accrue (and who, by seeking
for that result, comes to perform the act)?”

Our answer is that it is the Boy belonging to one of the three higher
castes, who has gone through the Initiatory Rite. That this is so is
clear from the fact that the act (of Vedic Study) has been prescribed
among the duties of the Religious Student. The Injunctive and other
similar affixes are expressive of that injunction or persuasion which is
inseparable from the person sought to be persuaded; and when the
question arises as to particular details regarding that person, (*a*)
sometimes the information is supplied by the words of the Injunction
itself—*e.g*., in the sentence ‘one desiring heaven should perform the
Agnihotra throughout his life (*b*) sometimes, even though not directly
mentioned, he comes to be assumed on the basis of what is directly
stated;—*e.g*., in the case of the *Viśvajit* and other
sacrifices;—(*c*) sometimes, again, he is indicated by the examination
of other Injunctions in view of the force of the context and the nature
of things. In the present case, all this is present:—(*a*) the Religious
Student happens to be the person dealt with in the context (in which the
injunction of Vedic Study occurs); (*b*) the comprehension comes about
from the nature of things; and (*c*) the Study is of use in connection
with all other Injunctions, as it is only one who has learnt the Veda
that is entitled to the performance of any Vedic act.

This explanation is not accepted by others. \[According to these\] it is
in the character of the ‘Injunction of Santcification’ itself that the
Injunction in question has (he corres-pondiṇg result indicated. As a
matter of fact, all sanctificatory acts are done for the sake of the
thing sought to be sanctified; and if no peculiarity is perceived in
that object, then the act would lose its very character of
‘sanctification,’ as it happens in the case of the ‘*Saktu*.’ In the
case in question, however, there does appear a peculiarity in the shape
of the comprehension of acts conducive to definite results. The case of
the ‘*Sviṣṭakṛt*’ offering has been cited above; but in that case the
two-fold character has to be admitted, as if both were not held to be
denoted by the root and the affix, then the act (of ‘sacrifice’) would
cease to be itself.

From all this it follows that the Injunction in question stands by
itself, and pertains to the initiated boy; and hence the act (of
‘study’) has to be done fo r its own sake, and not as subserving, like
the *threshing* of corn, the purpose of results proceeding from the
performance of the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices.

The same should be understood to be the case with the learning of more
than one Veda; In connection with this also, the question might arise as
to why one should learn several Vedas, when the Injunction is duly
fulfilled by the learning of one Veda only? And here also the answer
would be that the learning of several Vedas would be conducive to large
results. The result of such learning also would be of the nature
described above, and not of the nature ‘milk,’ ‘curd,’ and the like.
Such being the case, if one has learnt a single Veda, when he comes to
undertake the performance of acts requiring the use of mantras not
occurring in the particular Vedic Rescension learnt by him, the very
force of circumstances permits his learning of those Mantras; though in
describing the title to the performance of Vedic acts, as belonging to
‘persons who have learnt the Veda,’ the qualification mentioned is that
he should have *duly learnt* the Veda. \[But the peculiar circumstances
of the case render it permissible for the performer to leam the mantras
at the time\].

Others have held that in the text—‘that the Veda with its six subsidiary
sciences should be learnt is what should be done by the Brāhmaṇa without
any other motive,’—the phrase ‘without any other motive’ explains the
nature of the act as regards the person to perform it; the term ‘without
any motive’ means ‘without having any other end in view;’ so that what
is meant is that the act should be done as a compulsory one. Unless we
take this term as indicating the nature of the person to perform it, it
cannot be construed with the rest of the sentence either in the form of
an act, or in that of an agency contributing towards the act, or in that
of a qualification of the act, and so forth.

Thus, then, even though the Injunction in question be one of
sanctification, yet it may have its result indicated indirectly (as
explained before), or stated directly (as now explained); and neither of
this involves any incongruity.

Others, again, argue that since it is an Injunction of sanctification,
it is better to take it as not related to any result at all. For the
result is sought after only for endowing the act with a certain
peculiarity; and this peculiarity in the present case is obtained by
noting the thing to be sanctified. It is true that Injunctions of
sanctification stand in need of the mention of purposes served by them;
but all that is sought to be accomplished by an injunction is the result
of the act enjoined; and such result, in the present case, is actually
found to consist in the ‘getting up’ of the text; and there is nothing
incongruous in this.

The present verse not specifying the period for the learning of each
Veda, we derive the knowledge of the specific period from other
Smṛti-texts, which lay down that the studentship relating to each Veda
is to extend over twelve years.

The next question that arises is—which are the ‘three Vedas’ that are
meant here?

They are the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda and the Sāmaveda.

“Then, is the *Atharvan* not a Veda at all?”

Who says so? All that is meant by the present context is a certain
sanctification; and when the sanctification in question is found to be
one that can be accomplished by taking the words of the present verse in
their literal sense, the Injunction in question has its performance
secured by being extended up to the comprehension of meaning; and this
for the simple reason that the said comprehension is of use in all
performances. As for the Atharvan Veda, it deals for the most part with
magical spells, and hence neither the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other such acts,
nor any details pertaining to these, are prescribed in it; in fact, all
the duties relative to the *Hotṛ* the *Adhvaryu* and the *Udgātṛ* are
completely laid down in the Three Vedas; the duties of the
Brahman-priest also are laid down in the Three Vedas. Then, again, the
term ‘three’ denotes a special number, and whenever a particular numeral
is used, it is always with reference to a particular character (in which
the things included under that number are found to agree). So that, in
the case in question, those alone can be taken as included under the
number ‘three’ which are found to possess the common character of
containing Injunctions regarding what ought to be done. And the Atharvan
does not fall within this category; as it does not contain any
injunctions of such, primary acts as the Jyotiṣṭoma and the rest, not of
any of their subsidiaries. As regards the *Śyena* and other malevolent
sacrifices, these also are performed by the same priests (as the
*Jyotiṣṭoma*, &c.), and their procedure also is the same, with a few
additional details; but even those peculiar details are such as have
been prescribed in the Three Vedas. Thus, theu, since the Atharvan Veda
is\|not found, in the performance of any act, to be grouped either With
Ṛk and Yajus, or with Ṛk and Sāman, it cannot be included under the
appellation of ‘Three Vedas and this is the reason why it has not been
mentioned in the present context But, since it is included under the
term ‘*svādhyāya*,’ ‘*veda*,’ there is nothing incongruous in its being
included under the wider Injunction of ‘Vedic Study.’

‘*For half that period*’—‘*that period*’ refers to ‘thirty six years;’
the ‘half’ of which is eighteen years. Here also the division of time
would be six years for each Veda.

‘*Or for a quarter*;’—‘Quarter’ is the fourth part of the said number,
*i.e*., nine years, that is, three years for each of the three Vedas.

“But how can the Veda be got up in three years.”

It is quite possible that a certain pupil may be exceptionally
intelligent (and he could get up the Veda in three years).

Other people offer the following explanation:—The duties prescribed in
the verse are not made conditional upon the character of the ‘learning
they are conditioned by the injunction bearing upon the duties
themselves. So that if, before the learning has been accomplished, the
rules are duly observed for a few days during the course of learning,
the purpose of the Injunction becomes duly fulfilled; as the observance
of the details even to that extent would go to fulfil the conditions of
the Injunction of Vedic Study. If one puts an end to his observances
before he has got up the text, then he comes to be called a
‘*Vratasnātaka*’ ‘renouncer of observances.’ Thus, inasmuch as both
these contingencies are possible, it is only right that a definite
period of time should have been prescribed; and the meaning is that one
does not become entitled tō the title of ‘*Vratasnātaka*’ unless he has
put in *three years*’ work (at least). Though some *Smṛtis* lay down
that ‘there is Final Bath only on the completion of Vedic Study,’ yet it
is quite reasonable to apply the name ‘Bath’ (*snāna*) figuratively to
the completion of the observances relative to Vedic Study.

This, however, is not right. Though the observances are objects of
independent Injunctions, yet the right course to be adopted is that they
should be kept up as long as the ‘study’ continues. In fact, the
observances having been actually enjoined in connection with Study, they
must continue throughout the study. If the first part of the present
verse (consisting of the first three feet) were taken separately, then
the words of the text themselves would make the observances abandoned
after three years only, even before the ‘study’ has been finished. If,
on the other hand, the whole verse—including the last quarter—is taken
as a single sentence, then the observances cannot cease until the Veda
has been wholly learnt. In fact, the particle ‘*eva*,’ ‘precisely,’
clearly indicates that this last view is the correct one.

“If there is no cessation of the observances until the Vedas have been
learnt, how is it that three are two distinct titles (l)
‘*Vratasnātaka*’, ‘who has completed the observances.’ and (2)
*Vedasnātaka*,’ ‘who has completed the Veda’?”

We shall explain this under Discourse IV.

The aggregate of ‘thirty-six years’ is called ‘*ṣaṭtṛṃśadabdam*;’ that
which pertains to this aggregate is ‘*ṣaṭtṛṃśadābdikam*’. Similarly, the
term ‘*traivedikam*.’ That whose extent is half of that is
‘*tadardhikam*.’ Similarly, ‘*pādikam*’ and ‘*grahaṇāntikam*.’ The
possessive affix in these terms is in accordance with Pāṇini’s Sūtra
5.2.145. The forms cannot come under Pāṇini’s 5.1.57.—(1).

“The Atharva Veda is here, as in most of the ancient Dharmasūtras, left
out altogether. Baudhāyana alone states that the term of Studentship
extends over forty-eight years, and that rule includes the Atharva
Veda.”—Buhler.

*Medhātithi* (p. 187, l. 10)—‘*Yatraiva hi sviṣṭakṛdādayaḥ*.”—See
*Mīmāṃsā Sūtra* 4.1.18 *et seq*. The question being whether the
*Sviṣṭakṛt* offering (which is made with the remnants of the sacrificial
materials) serves only as a ‘disposal’, or it also serves some
transcendental purpose,—the conclusion is that in tills case a
transcendental result, even though not mentioned in the texts, has to be
assumed.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 97), where the following
notes are added:—‘*Traividyā* means *the three Vedas*;—the Studentship
over the three Vedas should be made to extend over thirty-six years;
that is, one should devote twelve years to studentship over each of the
three Vedas;—in the case of ‘half the period six years have to be
devoted to each of the three Vedas; and in the ease of ‘quarter of the
period only three years.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 557), where the following
totally different explanation is added:—The meaning of this is as
follows:—In the event, of the Boy studying the three Vedas, his
Studentship should extend over thirty-six years; if he studies only two
Vedas, then over ‘half, *i. e*. half of forty-eight years, or
twenty-four years; that such is the meaning we deduce from the other
texts bearing on the subject;—the ‘quarter’ also has to be similarly
explained. If the ‘half’ and ‘quarter’ were taken in relation to
‘thirty-six years’, then the meaning would he that the Studentship
should extend over *eighteen* and *nine* years respectively; and this
would not agree with any other *Smṛti* text This same consideration gets
rid of the fanciful view set forth by the *Candrikā* that “in the case
of ‘half’, the Boy should devote six years to each of the three Vedas,
and in that of ‘quarter’, three years to each.”

It is interesting that this last view has been adopted by Medhātithi.
(See Translation, p. 11). This view appears to have the support of
Yājñavalkya (l.36), which clearly states that—“Studentship should extend
over either twelve or five years *for each Veda*.”

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 67), which adds that the
studentship over one Veda is to extend over *six* years in the case of
‘half’, and over *three* years in the case of ‘quarter’;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 166), which adds the following
explanations:—‘*Traivedikam*’, pertaining to the three Vedas, Ṛk, Yajuṣ
and Sāman,—this should be carried on for 36 years,—similarly the vow of
‘Studentship’ pertaining to each single Veda is to be kept for 12
years,—in the case of the ‘*Ārdhika*’ system, 6 years have to be devoted
to each Veda,—and 3 years each in the case of the ‘*Pādika*’ system;—and
in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 779).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The ‘learning of Three Vedas’ has been mentioned (in the preceding
verse); the learning of ‘two’ and ‘one’ Veda, not having been mentioned
anywhere, are here put forward us alternatives. The term ‘*veda*’ in
this connection has been explained as standing for Recensional Text;
‘and what is meant is that one should learn three, or two, or one
Recension of each of the three Vedas,—and not that three or two or one
Recension of a single Veda should be learnt. Because the work to be
learnt has been called the ‘Triplicate Science.’

‘*Having learnt*’—having got up, by means of the above described course
of studentship.

‘*He should enter upon the state of the householder*’—The exact nature
of;the ‘Householder’s stage’ is going to be described later on (Verse 4,
below).—‘*Enter*,’ *i.e*., live; verbal roots having several meanings.
The prefix ‘ā’ denotes limit.

One who has taken a wife to himself is called ‘householder,’ which term
is used in its conventional, not etymological, sense; The term ‘house’
standing for *wife*; and he who *takes his stand upon that house* is
called ‘Householder.’

The term ‘*āśrama*,’ ‘*state*,’ stands for all those duties, positive
and negative, that have been prescribed (for the married man). Just as
for the ‘initiated boy,’ there is ‘state of studentship’ till the Final
Return from the Preceptor’s house, so for one who has married, it is the
‘state of the Householder,’

‘*Nor deviated from the votes of studentship*,’—*i.e*., he who has not
broken the vows of not having intercourse with women. This epithet has
to be regarded as a distinct sentence, in accordance with the usage of
stories; the sense being that (*a*) ‘the boy should not deviate from the
vows of studentship’ and (*b*) ‘he should enter upon the state of the
Householder.’ If the whole were taken as a single sentence, then, as a
result of this, one who has deviated from the vows would never be
entitled at all to enter upon the Householder’s state. If, however, we
take the epithet as an independent injunction pat forth for the man’s
benefit (and not as a necessary condition for entering upon
Householdership), then deviation from it makes the man liable to the
penalty of expiation, but it does not make him unfit to enter upon
Householdership.

By the words, ‘*having learnt, he should enter*,’ all that is meant is
that the two acts should come in this order,—entrance upon
Householdership following the ‘learning;’ and it is not meant that
marriage should come immediately after study. Because where the words
signify mere sequence, immediate sequence is not always meant. Hence
daring the time intervening between ‘Vedic Study’ and ‘marriage,’ it
becomes possible for the boy to carry on the study of Grammar and. other
Sciences, which help in the understanding of the meaning of Vedic texts.
In fact, it is only the learned man that is entitled to Householdership;
and it is not like the ‘Vedic Study,’ to which the entirely ignorant boy
is entitled. Though during boyhood, the boy is like a lower animal,
incapable of understanding what he is entitled to, yet he is made to act
either by his Father or by his Preceptor. In fact, the act of ‘Vedic
Study’ by the boy falls within the Father’s province; the
proper-teaching of the child being the Father’s duty; and the reason for
this lies in the fact that it is only when the child has been properly
taught that the Father is regarded as having duly fulfilled the
injunction of ‘begetting a child.’ ‘Teaching’ of the child, again,
consists in explaining to him what he should do and what he should not
do. And, if the Boy fails to understand his duties when these are
explained to him, he is led by the hand, like the blind man, and made to
fulfil them; just as he is caught firmly by the hand and saved from
falling into the fire or into the well, in the same manner, he is also
saved from drinking and other evils leading to imperceptible effects.
Or, again, just as a boy is made, against his wish, to drink a wholesome
medicine, so in the same manner, he is also made to do acts prescribed
in the scriptures. After he has become capable of understanding things a
little, he is directed by means of such words ‘you should do such and
such an act.’ Such being the case, when the Boy has learnt the Veda, he
should be instructed by his Father or Preceptor in such words as—‘You
have learnt the Veda, now you are fit for carrying on an investigation
into what is contained in it,—hence you should now hear lectures on the
subsidiary sciences.’ It is only when this advice has been given that
the father is regarded as having fulfilled the duty of ‘begetting a
child’; as it has been declared—‘the child is begotten only when he
comes to understand his own duties.’

From all this it becomes established that one should not marry
immediately after learning the Veda, until he has learnt what is
contained in the Veda; and the words of the text have to be construed
thus—‘Having learnt—*i.e*., after learning has been finished—one should
continue to be firm in the vows of studentship (*i.e*., ‘of
continence’). The cessation of continence having become permissible
(after the Veda has been learnt), its maintenance is reiterated with a
view to indicate that the other vows and restraints—such as the
avoidance of honey, meat and the rest—may be withdrawn. The conclusion
thus comes to be that, so long as the Veda is being learnt, the Boy
should keep all his vows of studentship,—but when the learning of the
Veda has been completed, and he continues his studies further for under
standing what is contained in the Veda, he should abstain only from
intercourse with women.

Though the term ‘*brahmacharya*,’ ‘*vows of studentship*,’ is ordinarily
explained as standing for those observances and restraints that are kept
up for the proper learning of the Veda,—yet in the present context it
has been used in the sense of ‘avoiding intercourse with women,’—as we
shall show later on.

‘*In due course*,’—*i.e*., according to that order of reading which is
well known among students; *i.e*. first of all one should read the
sixty-four sections of the Saṃhitā (of the Ṛgveda), then the Brāhmaṇa,
and so forth, in the same order of sequence in which they may have been
studied by his forefathers. In matters like this, no one can rightly say
that ‘one should not follow either family traditions, or the dictates of
morality, or orderly sequence.’ The meaning of all this is that ‘one
should not abandon that Recensional Text which may have been learnt by
his father and other ancestors.’—(2)

*Medhātithi* (p. 189, 1. 14)—‘*Vedaśabdaḥ śākhāvacano
vyākhyātaḥ*’—Hopkins calls this ‘a later view’ and refers to Āpastamba
2. 6.5.

The first quarter of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on p. 24, l.
36), in amplification of Yājñavalkya’s statement that ‘Studentship is to
extend over twelve years’, and the meaning is deduced that twelve years
should be devoted to the study of each Veda.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 131);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 505), where the note is added that—‘If one
intends to perform the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and such other sacrifices, which can
be performed only with the help of the three Vedas, one has to learn all
the three Vedas, the Ṛk, Yajuṣ and Sāman;—if he is going to perform the
*Prākṣaumika* and the *Haviryajñas*, he has to learn only, two, the Ṛk
and the Yajuṣ;—while if he intends to perform only the *Pākayajñas*, he
should learn only his own hereditary rescensional Vedic text; in the
case of the other Vedas also, he should confine himself to only those
rescensions which may have been studied by his forefathers, and not any
one at random.

The verse is also quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 587) in support of the
view that every Brāhmaṇa is entitled to the study of various Vedic
rescensional texts;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 680); in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*
(p. 568);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 49a).

‘*When he has acquired the Veda and his heritage, the father shall
honour him first with the cow*,’ He who has acquired both, the Veda
(‘*Brahman*’) and the heritage (‘*dāya*’) is called
‘*brahmadāyādāharaḥ*.’ ‘*Dāya*’ (Heritage) is *what is given*, *i.e*.,
*property*;—‘*Brahman*’ is ‘*Veda*’;—‘*haraṇa*’ is *acquiring*. It is
only when the boy has learnt the Veda and received his share of the
ancestral property from his father that he takes to the Householder’s
state; a man without any property not being entitled to enter upon that
stage. If the father happens to have no property, he should earn wealth
by begging for the avowed purpose of marrying his son (and thereby
maintaining his line), and then marry him.

Others explain the *Veda* itself as being the ‘heritage;’ and regard the
present verse as a reiteration of the foregoing Injunction! for the
purpose of indicating that it is to be learnt from the Father.

“It having been declared before that it is the Preceptor whose function
it is to teach the Veda, why is it that the boy is now spoken of as
acquiring the Veda and ‘heritage’ *from his father?*”

The answer to this is as follows:—For him whose Father is living, the
Father himself is the ‘Preceptor.’ It is only when the Father is not
living, or when he is somehow incapacitated, that another person may act
as the ‘Preceptor.’ By the appointing of another man as the ‘Preceptor,’
the Father’s title to act as one ceases. But, whether the Father himself
teaches his son or some one else teaches him, it makes no difference.

Some people have urged the following argument—“In connection with the
Upanayana, it has been laid down, as a compulsory duty that the ‘gift
should consist of some very superior thing’ (Gautama, 25.6); from which
it is dear that the function is to be performed by some one else (and
not by the Father himself).”

This is not right. That the Fee should consist of a very superior thing
is an Injunction in connection with the Upanayana, the Initiatory Rite;
and whether the Initiator is the Father or some other Preceptor, neither
of these persons requires any incentive to perform this function; and
fees are paid only as incentives to service; nor is any incentive
necessary in a case where the person engages in the work under the
influence of some other form of prompting. For these reasons, the term
‘Fee’ in the context in question, being found incapable of conveying the
sense of *an incentive to work*, must be taken as standing for some such
gift as is made for the purpose of some transcendental results, just
like the giving of gold. And it is the Father who should make the Boy
the owner of enough wealth to enable him to make a gift of the ‘superior
thing.’

If one were to insist upon the following argument—“it is not possible
for the term *fee* to be used in any sense other than what is paid as an
incentive to serve, and so long as a word can be taken in its primary
sense, it cannot be right to have recourse to any secondary
signification,”—then, in that case, the said Injunction of the Fee will
have to be regarded as applying to such cases where, as in the case of
Satyakāma Jābāla, neither the Father is alive, nor is there any other
Preceptor appointed as the Father’s substitute, and where the Boy
presents himself (to a Teacher) for Initiation. And it has been already
explained that such a boy, having passed his childhood, is fully
entitled to have his sacraments performed for himself.

Thus, in both cases, it is the Father’s function; he may do the
initiating himself or get it done by another Preceptor.

‘*Inclined*’—*i.e*., who is inclined towards entering the life of the
Householder,—and not him who is going to be a lifelong student, even
though the latter may be returning home simply for the sake of obeying
the rule regarding the completion of study.

‘*Adorned with garland*’—this is meant to include all the details that
have been laid down by the authors of the *Gṛhyasūtras* in connection
with the ‘*Madhuparka*’ offering.

‘*Seated upon a couch*’—seated upon a valuable sofa.

‘*With the cow*’—*i.e*., with the ‘*Madhuparka*’ offering. The offering
of the cow in the ‘*Madhuparka*’ has been prescribed as an optional
alternative; hence the term ‘cow’ here stands for that particular act
(of *offering*) which is done by means of the cow.

‘*Shall honour*’—this is the duty of the Father or the Preceptor.

‘*First*’—*i.e*., before marriage.

‘*Inclined*’—*i.e*., lying down upon the couch for the purpose of
receiving the offering.

‘*By* *the strict* *observance of his duties*’—this is a super-fluous
reiteration; and it makes no difference whether it is construed with
‘acquiring the Veda and his heritage,’ or with ‘shall honour.’—(3).

*Medhātithi* (p. 190, 1. 21)—‘*Sāntānikatayā*’—Apte explains
‘*sāntānika*’ as ‘a Brāhmaṇa who wishes to marry for the sake of issue.’
This is not quite correct. The word occurs in Manu 11. 1, where Kullūka
explains it as ‘*vivāhārthi*,’ which has apparently misled the
lexicographer. The word really means ‘he who is desirous of *santāna*,
propagation of his race’, and is applied to the Father who, if poor, has
to beg for the purpose of marrying *his son*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 76), which adds the following
explanation: When the Accomplished Student has been understood
(*pratīta*) as inclined to take a wife;—he being
‘*brahmadāyahara*’—*i.e*., equipped with study of the Veda, and
inherited property, *i.e*., being quite able to maintain a family;—if
the father be devoid of property, he should acquire enough by means of
begging, and then marry; and thus obtain the ‘domestic fire,’ without
which he could not perform the *Pākayajñas*.—‘*Sragvin*’ indicates the
presence of ornaments;—‘*talpa*’ is *bedstead*; when the young man is
seated upon it his father ‘should worship him first with the
*cow*’—*i.e*., with the *Madhuparka*.

Even on the completion of the observances relating to Vedic Study, the
Boy shall “bathe” only when ‘*permitted by the Preceptor*.’ ‘*Bathing*’
here stands for a peculiar sacrament prescribed in the *Gṛhyasūtras*, as
the limit for the observances of the Religious Student. Why the term
‘bathing’ is used in this figurative sense we have already explained
above.

‘*Having returned*’—*i.e*., having gone through a particular
consecratory. rite consisting of the offering of the *Madhuparka*, etc.,
as laid down in the *Gṛhyasūtra*, and having returned from the
Preceptor’s home to his Father’s home.

All this has been mentioned as supplementary to the Injunction contained
in the term ‘*shall take*,’ being already known from other sources. The
‘return’ spoken of here is not a part of the ‘marriage.’ Hence for him
who has learnt the Veda in his Father’s house, though there can be no
‘Return,’ yet marriage is done.

Some people take the ‘Return’ to mean that Bath which forms part of the
marriage rites. Against this view it might be argued that the
participial ending ‘*ktvā*’ (in ‘*snātvā*’) clearly indicates that the
two (Bath and Return) are entirely different. But that ceremony of
‘Return’ which coṇsists in ‘bathing’ and which forms part of the
marriage rite, is going to be described later; where a particular form
of ‘Bathing’ with its details is found laid down, \[Hence the ‘Return’
mentioned, in the present verse cannot be regarded as part of
Marriage.\]

Or, the term ‘*Return*’ may be taken as intended to connote *the
renouncing of restraints and observances*. In that case, ‘*returned*’
would mean ‘having resumed the former condition free from all
restraint.’ Special stress is laid upon the *renouncing of restraints*
in this connection, because the observances and restraints imposed upon
the Religious Student are exceptionally hard, which is not the case with
the other subsequent stages of life.

‘*According to rule*’—this is to be construed like the term ‘in strict
accordance with his duties’ (of the preceding verse).

‘*The twice-born person shall take a wife*’—‘Shall take’ constitutes the
injunction of marriage. Marriage is a sacramental rite, a refining
process, as is indicated by the Accusative ending in ‘*bhāryām*.’

“But before marriage there does not exist such a thing as *wife* for
whom the refinement could be effected in the same manner as
ornamentation by collyrium is done to the Eye. In fact, it is by means
of marriage itself that the *wife* is brought into existence.”

In the case of the sacrificial post, we find such injunctions as the
‘sacrificial post shall be cut,’ and that same piece of wood becomes the
*post* on which the refining process of *cutting*, &c., has been
performed. Exactly in the same manner it is by means of the refining
process of marriage performed upon her that the person becomes a ‘wife.’

The word ‘marriage’ denotes the *taking hold of the hand*, which forms
the principal factor in the ceremony. To this effect we have the
assertion—‘marriage is taking a wife, *i.e*., the taking hold of the
hand;’ and in this work also marriage is spoken of as ‘the sacrament of
taking hold of the hand’ (verse 43 below). The offering of parched grain
and such other rites are the subsidiary details (of Marriage); and all
this may be learnt from the *Gṛhyasūtras*,

Later on (in verse 8) we read—‘one shall not marry a *maiden* with
golden hair, &e., &c.’—and from the use of the term ‘maiden’ there it
is clear that marriage is a sacrament for maidens, and not for any and
every woman; and we are going to explain later on that in the present
context the term ‘maiden’ stands for *the female who has had no
intercourse with a male*.

‘*Of the same caste as himself*’—*i.e*., belonging to the same caste.

‘*Endowed with signs*,’—The term ‘*signs*’ stands for the colour of the
complexion, lines on the body, moles and such other marks which are
indicative of unwidowed life, offspring, wealth, and so forth,—which may
be learnt from the science of Astrology.—‘*Endowed’—i.e*.,
equipped—‘with these signs;’ *i.e*., bearing auspicious marks. Even
though indicators of evil are also called ‘signs,’ yet since what is
mentioned here is, that one should marry a girl with these signs, it
follows that what is meant is the girl with good, auspicious, signs. In
fact, the term, ‘*lakṣaṇa*,’ ‘sign,’ is used in ordinary parlance in the
sense of desirable signs; *e.g*., men and women are spoken of as
‘endowed with signs’ which means that they bear auspicious marks.

What we have to consider in this connection is the question of *title*
(Who is entitled to marry?).

Since the Injunction of marriage enjoins a sacrament, a consecration, it
comes to be performed just like the Laying of Fire; and just as the
Laying of Fire serves, through the *Āhavanīya* and other fires, the
purposes of compulsory and voluntary acts, and hence it comes to be
performed for the bringing into existence of the *Āhavanīya*, &c., as
subsidiary to those acts,—so the Marriage also brings into existence the
‘Wife,’ and through her serves the fulfilment of the visible and
unvisible ends of man. For example, when desire for sexual intercourse
arises in man, there arises the possibility of his having recourse to
any and every woman; but intercourse with maidens and wives of other men
being prohibited, the said desire comes to be accomplished only through
one’s own married wife \[The married wife thus serves a visible end\].
Then again, there is the saying that ‘every religious act shall be done
by the husband and wife together,’ which shows that it is only as
accompanied by his wife that man is entitled to the performance of
religious acts; and thus it is clear that the accomplishment of the
invisible (transcendental) purposes of man also is dependent upon the
wife.

In connection with this subject, some people make the following
observations:—“As just described, persons, with their sexual desire
aroused, have, of their own accord, their marriages done for the purpose
of accomplishing their visible ends; and after they have married, they
happen to perform certain religious acts; and in this case, the marriage
might thus turn out to be of use in the fulfilment of religious acts.
But in a case where a man’s desire for intercourse with women has
entirely ceased, there is no marriage at all;—there being no marriage,
the man is not entitled to the performance of religious acts;—in the
absence of such title, the non-performance of acts shall involve no
sin;—consequently, there need be nothing reprehensible in the conduct of
the man who does not take to the Householder’s life and does not perform
any religious acts conducive to the ends of man.”

This, however, is not right. Religious acts are as much conducive to the
fulfilment of man’s purpose as sexual desire is. In fact, every man
engages in activity only for the accomplishment of some purpose of his.
If this were not so (*i.e*., the entrance into the Householder’s state
were not essential), then there would be no room for such assertions as
‘desisting for a year from entering into the Householder’s state, &c.,
&c.’ *We* shall explain this fully under Discourse VI, in connection
with the question of option regarding the Life-stages.—(4)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 462) simply as
laying down marriage;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 131) as indicating the
necessity for marriage;—also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 673);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 567), as indicating that the ‘Final Bath’
spoken of above (in 1. 245) is meant to be for the purpose of
marriage;—on the ground that the Bath is here spoken of in connection
with the twice-born person *who is going to marry*; while we do not meet
with any such assertion as ‘Having bathed, he should betake himself to
the forest,’ or that ‘having bathed,’ he should bike to Renunciation;—in
the same work on p. 585, in support of the view that Marriage is meant
to be conducive to the fulfilment of the man’s purpose, the following
notes are added:—the term ‘*dvija*’ serves to show that it is only the
twice-born person *endowed with the above-mentioned qualifications* that
is entitled to marriage; and it does not mean that any and every
twice-born person is entitled to it; and that this is so is clear from
the fact that marriage has been laid down only for one who has had his
Initiation and has taken the ‘Final Bath’ of the Studentship. Nor again
can the term ‘*dvija*’ be taken as precluding others; as in that case
there would be no marriage for the *Śūdra*. From all this it follows
that the present text should be taken as enjoining a particular act as
pertaining to a particularly qualified person.—The term ‘*bhāryā*,’
‘wife,’ has been used in view of the future status of the girl; so that
the meaning of the injunction comes to be that ‘he should bring into
existence a *wife* by means of the marriage-ceremony.’—The term
‘*Savarṇā*,’ ‘of the same caste’ is meant to indicate that such a
marriage would be in its principal form: and it does not preclude the
marrying of girls of other castes; this is in fact sanctioned by other
texts.

The same work quotes the verse again on page 747, as laying down the
‘principal’ wife ordained for man.

*Vīramitrodaya* again in its ‘*Lakṣaṇa*’ section (p. 118) quotes the
second half of this verse under the ‘the characteristics of women.’

It is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 940) to the effect that
‘*Samāvartana*’ is another name for the concluding rites of
Studentship;—in *Aparārka* (p. 76) as indicating that the ‘Bath’ is
distinct from the *Samāvartana* ceremony;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p.
680);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 403);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 49a.)
