‘*Vaiśvadeva*,’ ‘*for the Viśvedevas*’—*i.e*., what is cooked for the
sake of the Viśvedevas. Though the term ‘*viśvedeva*’ literally means
‘all deities,’ yet here it is indicative of only those to whom oblations
are offered. Hence the term may be taken as standing also for what is
cooked for guests and others.

‘*Out of the food cooked, Homa should be offered to these deities*’— to
those going to be mentioned in the next verse. The term ‘*cooked*’
implies that the offering is made out of what has been already cooked
for all recipients, and that there is no special cooking for the deities
only, done with the *mantra ‘Devasya tvā savituḥ, etc*.’

‘*According to rule*’—this means that the Homa is to be offered in
accordance with rules laid down in the *Gṛhyasūtras*; by which all such
details of procedure become included as sweeping the spot, sprinkling
water over it, and so forth.

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ is for the purpose of indicating the fact of the
three higher castes being entitled to the performance.

‘*Every day*’— daily.

‘*Deities*’ (in the Dative) serves to indicate the necessity of using
the syllable ‘*svāhā*,’ If the genitive bad been used, then the words
need (at the offering) would have been ‘*agneḥ idam*’ (not ‘*agnaye
svāhā*). The use of the term ‘*devatā*’ (‘Deity’), however, makes the
rule mean that ‘all offerings to the gods should be made with’ the
syllable *svāhā*.’ As for the syllable ‘*vaṣaṭ*,’ it is to be pronounced
at the end of the ‘*Yājyā*’ *mantras*, but never at a *Smārta Homa*;
while the syllable ‘*svāhā*’ is to be pronounced at all *Homas*; such
being the case, the formula used should be ‘*agnaye svāhā*.’—(84)

oblations of cooked food; to the deities of the Agnihotra, to Soma, to
Vanaspati, to Agni-Soma, to Indra-Agni, to Dyauḥ-Pṛthivī, to
Dhanvantari, to Indra, to Viśvedevas, and to Brahman.’

*Pāraskara* (2.9.1.12).—‘Out of the food dedicated to the Viśvedevas, he
shall offer oblations with *svāhā* to Brahman, to Prajāpati, to the
Gṛhyās, to Kaśyapa, to Anumati, to Bhūtagṛhas, to Parjanya, to Apas, to
Pṛthivī to Dhātṛ, to Vidhātṛ; to Vāyu and to the Quarters, towards each

Sūrya; to the north of these, to all-gods and all-elementals; to Uṣas
and to the Lord of the elementals; on the South, to the Pitṛs; and at
the end he should offer to the Brāhmaṇas; and it should he distributed
in the right proportion, among beggars and guests.’

*Gautama* (5.11-16).—‘Homa-oblations should he offered into the fire, to
Agni, to Dhanvantari, to Viśvedevas, to Prajāpati and to Sviṣṭakṛt; to
the presiding deity of each of the quarters, towards each quarter; on
the doorway, to the Maruts; entering the room, to the household deities:
over the centre, to Brahman; on the water-jar, to Apas; in the sky, to
Ākāśa; in the evening, to the night-walkers.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.3.17-23; and 2.4.1-8).—‘In the making of the
Bali-offerings, each spot should he swept and washed with water; and on
each one of these spots food should he served;...... at the bedstead
with the Kāma-mantra; at the door-step, with the
Antarikṣa-mantra;......... towards the south, with the Pitṛ-mantra;
towards the north, to Rudra; the last one in the evening towards the
sky.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.9.5.6).—‘he shall make all beings—down to
dogs and Caṇḍālas—partakers in the Vaiśvadeva offering; but according to
some, it shall not be offered to the undeserving.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.4).—‘Having offered his share to the learned guest, or to
the religious student, he shall make the offering to the Pitṛs.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (1.2.3-10).—‘Next the Bali-offerings; to the
gods, to Apas, to the Herbs, to Trees, to the Household, to the
Household Deities, and to the Vāstudevas; to Indra and to Indrapuruṣas,
to Yama and to Yamapuruṣas, to Varuṇa and to Varuṇapuruṣas, to Soma and
to Somapuruṣas,—these towards each of the quarters; in the centre, to
Brahman and to Brahmapuruṣas; to the Viśvedevas; during the day, to all
the day-walkers; and in the evening, to the night-walkers and towards
the north, to the Rakṣas.’

*Gobhila* (1.4.8-12).—‘The first offering that he makes is the offering
to Pṛthivī; the second is the offering to Vāyu, the third is the
offering to the Viśvedevas, and the fourth is the offering to Prajāpati.
Then follow the other Bali-offerings; the first to the water-deity, made
on the water-jar, the centre and the door-way; the second to Herbs and
Trees; and the third to Ākāśa. Then comes another offering: over the
bedstead, either to Kāma or to Manyu; then to the Rakṣojanas. The
remnant of all these offerings is deposited towards the South, and it
goes to the Pitṛs.’

*Yajñavalkya* (1.103).—‘Out of the food left after the offerings to
gods, ho shall make the offering to elementals; and he shall deposit
food on the ground, for dogs, Caṇḍālas and crows.’

ground.’

The term ‘*first*’ is a mere reiterative reference; that the offering to
Agni is to be made first of all being already indicated by the order in
which the names are mentioned. These two offerings are to be distinct
(one to each); while the next is to the two together—the formula used
being ‘*agnīsomābhyām svāhā*.’ For the next, the formula is ‘*viśvebhyo
devebhyaḥ, svāhā*.’ Only one offering is to be made with the words,
‘*Dhanvantaraye svāhā*,’—(85)

‘*To Dyauḥ-Pṛthivī jointly*’—with the formula ‘*dyāvā-pṛthivībhyām
svāhā*.’

‘*Finally to Sviṣṭakṛt*’—‘*Sviṣṭakṛt*’ (accomplisher of what is
extremely desirable) is an adjective, the deity qualified by it being
Agni. That this is so is indicated by the assertion in another *Smṛti*
to the effect that ‘this offering is to be made *to Agni-Sviṣṭakṛt*.’
This offering to *Agni-Sviṣṭakṛt* has been prescribed in the Veda as to
be made in the case of all *Homas*.

‘*Finally*’— though this is already implied by the order in which the
names have been mentioned, yet it has been reiterated (by means of the
term ‘finally’) for the purpose of indicating that when, according to
another *Smṛti*, a large number of oblations are offered conjointly
under this head, that to ‘*Agni-Sviṣṭakṛt*’ should come first.

“All these oblations forming a single act of *Homa*, the several deities
mentioned should be treated as optional alternatives.”

But whence does- it follow that there is a single Homa? Verse 85, which
speaks of oblations ‘to Agni and to Soma, etc.,’ is the originative
Injunction of the Homas; and hence the *Homa* -offerings being severally
qualified by the mention of several special deities, the Homas are
clearly recognised as distinct.—(86)

‘*Duly*’—*i.e*., with the mind bent upon the deity, and not wandering
over anything else.

Having offered in the Fire the oblation to these deities—he should place
‘*in all directions*, *proceeding*,’ in due order, ‘*towards his
right*;’ at first in the East, then in the South, and so forth, this
being the ‘movement towards one’s right;’

‘*To* *Indra, Antaka, Ap-pati and Indu*’—in each direction.

Another writer remarks that ‘Indu’ has no share in the oblation (the
offering being made to *Soma*). If this name is not to be used in making
the offering, how could ‘Indu’ be spoken of (as he is in this verse) as
a partaker of the oblation? And it has been explained that the ‘placing
of the *bali*’ is nothing other than *Homa*.

As a matter of fact, no stress is meant to be laid upon the special form
of the names used; as they have been used only in view of the exigencies
of metre; so that, in actual usage, the names to be used should be those
mentioned in other *Smṛtis*.

‘*Along with their followers*’—‘followers’ stands for servants,
attendants; the formula used in such cases being ‘*Indrapuruṣebhyaḥ
svāhā*,’ and so forth.—(87)

The particle ‘*iti*’ is meant to lay stress upon the exact form of the
words to be used.

‘*In water*’—this specifies the receptacle of the offering; and ‘*to
Apas*’ indicates the deity to whom the offering is to be made.

‘*Saying “this to Vanaspatis,” on the pestle and mortar*; the singular
number in the Copulative Compound ‘*musalolūkhale*’ would indicate that
the two things are not two optional alternative receptacles; and, since
two receptacles are mentioned, the right. course would appear to be that
there should be a repetition of the oblation, which is the principal
factor; specially, as it is not possible for the pestle and the mortar
to be unified and then serve as a receptacle for the offering; as the
two will ever remain distinct; they can never be mixed up like milk and
water; so that if the oblation is poured on the mortar, it is not poured
on the pestle; and if it is poured on the pestle, it is not poured on
the mortar; nor is it possible for the oblation to be poured in parts
(over the two receptacles); as the exact quantity of the oblation has
been fixed by law. With all this, in view of the copulative compound, it
appears best that the oblation should be poured on one of the two things
mentioned (*i.e*., either on the pestle or on the mortar).—(88)

‘*Head*’—is the top-most place, known as the dwelling of the gods; on
this he should make the offering to Śrī; and ‘*on the feet*’—*i.e*., on
the lower side of the house—*Ho Bhadrakālī*;’ the place of dwelling of
this goddess being the East of the door.

Others have explained ‘*head*’ to mean that side of the householder’s
bed where his head lies; and the ‘*feet*’ to be the lower side of the
same. According to this explanation, this oblation may be placed either
on the bedstead or on the ground, on the spot where the householder’s
bed lies.

‘*For Brahman and Vāstoṣpati*.’—Even though these deities have been
coupled together in a copulative compound, yet the two oblations are
distinct, one to Brahman and another to Vāstoṣpati. In cases where two
gods together form the ‘deities,’—as in the case of ‘Agni-Soma’—the two
are taken together or conjointly; for example (*a*) ‘to the two
together’ (as mentioned in 85 above), and ‘to Heaven and Earth
conjointly’ (as mentioned in 86 above). The two mentioned here are to be
treated separately, as they are not known to be companions.

‘*Homestead*’ means the *house*; and it is in the centre of the house
that the offering is to be placed.—(89)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Ucchīrṣake*’—‘Head of the bed’ (‘Others’in Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘the North-East portion of the house, where the head of the
Vāstupuruṣa lies’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the place of
the head, well-known as the *Devatāśaraṇa*’ (the N.-E. corner of the
house is what is meant).

‘*Pādataḥ*’—‘the lower portion of the house’ (Medhātithi);—‘the South
West corner of the house, where the Vāstupuruṣa has his feet’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), which explains
‘*Ucchīrṣahe*’ as ‘the head of the bedstead lying in the house’—and
‘*Pādataḥ*’ as ‘the foot-end of the bedstead in the house’, and adds
that the formula to be used in making the offering should be as put in
the text ‘*Brahmavāstoṣpatibhyām svāhā*.’

The particle ‘*eha*’ indicates that there is only one oblation.

‘*To the Viśvedevas*’ the offering is to be thrown up into the
sky—either within the house, or outside the house.

During the day, the offering should be made to the ‘elementals roaming
in the day,’ and during the night it should be made to those ‘roaming at
night;’—‘elementals’ being construed both ways.

Some people explain that these two offerings pertain respectively to the
morning and evening.

But this is not right, as the evening-oblation is to be offered without
any words, as is going to be mentioned below (verse 121).

“But what is mentioned there may mean simply that the articulate
dedication of the offering is forbidden; but what is there to prevent
the mental (silent) dedication? In fact, without some such dedication
the offering would not be an ‘offering’ at all.”

But what you have got to explain is—from where you have learnt this
distinction. If it is one that has been made by authors of the
(*Gṛhyasūtras* themselves;—then it may be as you say.—(90)

What is said here is supplementary to the two offerings spoken of in the
latter half of the foregoing verse; and the first, half of this verse
prescribes the receptacle for those two offerings.

The dwelling on the top of another dwelling is called the ‘*upper
dwelling*.’ In the case of a single-storied house, it means the *roof*.
There one should make the offering to the ‘roamers at night’ and
‘roamers during the day.’

‘*Sarvānnabhūtaye*’—‘*for the purpose* *of* *acquiring all kinds* *of
food*’;—the Dative ending has the sense of ‘for the purpose of,’ ‘with a
view to,’ and not that of ‘recipient;’ for no oblations have been laid
down as to be offered to any such deity as *Sarvānnabhūti*; specially,
as the term ‘offering’ in the present verse is supplementary to the
preceding verse, and the offerings prescribed in the preceding verse
require the mention of a receptacle for them. Even in other *Smṛtis* no
such deity as ‘*Sarvānnabhūti*’ has been mentioned in connection with
the ‘*Vaiśvadeva*’ offerings. Hence, what the word means is that ‘the
act is to be done *for* *the purpose o* *f* *acquiring all kinds of
food*;’ *i.e*., ‘when this offering is made, all kinds of food are
obtained.’ And when the etymological signification of a word is found
compatible with the context, there can be no justification for assuming
a signification for the word as a whole (irrespectively of its
etymology.) So that, if the word (‘*Sarvānnabhūti*’) were to be taken as
signifying a deity, an absolutely unknown denotation will have to be
attributed to it.

‘*The remnant of the offerings*;’—tbe use of the term ‘remnant’ implies
that the offering material has to be collected in a vessel and then
offered, and that the oblations are not to be taken out of what is
contained in the cooking pot.

‘*Towards the South*’—*i.e*., in the southerly direction; *i.e*., the
man should face the south.

‘*Entire*’—*i.e*., all that has been taken out in the vessel.—(91)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Pṛṣṭhavāstuni*’—‘On the upper storey, or on the roof of the house’
(Medhātithi);—‘behind the house’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘outside
the house’ (Nandana);—‘behind the offerer’s back’ (Kullūka).

‘*Sarvānnahhūtaye*’—‘The same deity occurs in Śāṅkhāyana, *Gṛhyasūtra*,
2.14, where Professor Oldenberg has *Sarvannabhūti*, while the
Petersburg Dictionary gives *Sarvānubhūti*”—Buhler.

Medhātithi denies that there is any such ‘deity’ and he is averse to
assuming any such unheard of deity, when the literal meaning of the term
is not incompatible with the text,—‘for the acquiring of all kinds of
food.’ Kullūka, however, who reads ‘*Sarvātmabhūtaye*’ takes it as the
name of a deity.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), where the
following explanations are added:—*Pṛṣṭhavāstuni*’ means ‘behind the
house, in the place where the urinal is situated’;—‘*Sarvānubhūti*’ is a
deity of that name;—‘*haret*’ means ‘should offer’.

Having taken up some food in a vessel, he should place food on the
ground, with a view to benefit the dogs and the rest.

‘*Persons afflicted with filthy diseases*’—Lepers, consumptives, and so
forth.

‘*Vayāṃsi*’—birds.

‘*Gently*’—*i.e*., in such, a way that the food does not become mixed
with the dust raised from the ground.

The ‘*ground*’ has been mentioned, not with a view to preclude the use
of a vessel, but simply to indicate that food for the Cāṇḍāla, the
outcast and the leper should not be given in their hands.

What the present verse prescribes is the *according of help*; that is
why the verse contains the Genitive, not the Dative, ending.

For the birds, food should be placed on a spot where they can eat it
without being scared away by dogs, &ç.

For *insects*, the food should be placed on a spot where they are likely
to be present.—(92)

that (b) in texts laying down such offerings to the ‘unfit’, it is
persons afflicted with ‘filthy diseases’ that are meant;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 316) as laying down the offering of food outside

This sums up what has gone before.

The epithet ‘*all*’ indicates that one should help with food the deer,
the cock, the cat and such other animals as grow in the villages.

‘*Honour*’ here denotes *help*, not *worship*; us worship could not
apply to dogs, &c. In fact, what is meant is the forbidding of
ill-treatment; and it in with this view that the author has not used the
term ‘help.’

‘*Highest place*’—*i.e*., he reaches Brahman.

‘*By the straight path*’—*i.e*., he has not to wander through an endless
series of births as different animals.

*Question*—“Is this verse meant to lay down the reward (to be
obtained)?”

We say—*no*. For it has already been explained that the injunction of
the offerings is an obligatory one; and if a reward happen to be
mentioned in connection with an obligatory act, it can only be taken as
a commendatory description. Nor is any injunctive word found in the
verse; the word used is ‘*goes*,’ in the present tense.

‘*With a body of light*’—*i.e*., with a body made up of light only; he
is no longer tramelled with a body made up of the five elemental
substances; *i.e*., he becomes of the nature of pure Consciousness. Or,
the term may be takeu as connoting *freedom from sin*; the meaning being
that he becomes pure of character. The act done is one of helping all
beings; and when the man does not transgress any scriptural injunctions,
he incurs no sin; and hence it is only right that he should be *pure*.
If it were otherwise, then *sin* being an impurity, he could never have
a *body of light*. There being no sin in him, it is only natural that
the man should reach the highest place, which consists in a state free
from all pain and suffering.—(93)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Tejomūrtiḥ*’—‘Endowed with the body of light,’ qualifying the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ (Medhātithi);—Kullūka reads ‘*tejomūrti*’ (neuter) and
explains it as ‘resplendent’, qualifying the ‘place’.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), where it is
noted that the use of the word ‘*archati*’, ‘honours’, is meant to imply
that even the making of offerings to crows and others should not be
accompanied by a feeling of disrespect, or contempt.—‘*Patharjunā*’ is
to be construed as ‘*ṛjunā pathā*’.
