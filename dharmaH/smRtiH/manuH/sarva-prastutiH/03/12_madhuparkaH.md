<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In course of the entertaining of guests, the Text proceeds to lay down
the special form of honouring of a few other respected persons also.

‘*King*’—stands here for the annointed king of men, and not for the mere
*Kṣatriya* in general. The honour here prescribed is a very great one,
and every *Kṣatriya* does not deserve it. Nor would it be right to speak
of an ordinary *Kṣatriya* along with the ‘accomplished student’ and the
‘teacher;’ for there can be no similarity between the honour accorded to
the Teacher and to an ordinary *Kṣatriya*. There are Vedic texts also
indicative of the same conclusion. For instance, in the
*Ātithyeṣṭi-Brāhmaṇa* we read—‘the guest is like a *king of men*
arrived;’ and in connection with the rule of killing a cow for the
offering of ‘Honey-mixture,’ we find the guest spoken of as ‘the killer
of cows;’ all which goes to show that the said offering is meant for the
*king of men*. Hence the honour here mentioned is to be paid to a king
of men, irrespective of his being a *Kṣatriya* or not. But so far as the
*Śūdra* king of men is concerned, no honours are to be paid to him which
are accompanied by the recitation of Vedic Mantras.

“All that is prohibited is the uttering of *mantras* by the *Śūdra*;
there is no prohibition of the reciting of *mantras* by the Brāhmaṇa and
others at an offering made to the *Śūdra*.”

This does not affect our position; as the persons honoured have also got
to recite certain *mantras*, such as ‘*bhūtebhyastvā*, &c.’

“But in the *Mahābhārata* we read of the Honey-mixture offered by the
*Śūdra* also: ‘He himself offered to the Blessed Lord a seat fit for
him, as also the Honey-mixture and the cow,’—where Vidura is described
as offering it to Vāsudeva.”

In such cases, the term ‘honey-mixture’ is used figuratively in the
sense of *curd*, which is one of the ingredients of that mixture; and,
in common usage, the name of a thing is applied to another when the
latter helps in the bringing into existence of the former; when, for
instance, Butter is spoken of as ‘longevity’ itself.

From all this it is clear that the term ‘*king*’ here denotes the *king
of men*, and not the mere *Kṣatriya*.

The term ‘*priya*’ has been declared to mean the *son-in-law*.

‘*Accomplished student*’—*i.e*., accomplished, not in learning ail’d
observances both (but only in learniug, still keeping up the
observances). If it had stood for one who has accomplished and finished
*both*, then, since the ‘Teacher’ and the ‘Priest’ also would be such
‘accomplished students’ (there would be no point in mentioning these
separately). As for people in the other states (of the Recluse, etc.),
for these feeding on alms has been prescribed, and not eating in the
manner of ‘guests.’ Or, the term ‘*snātaka*,’ ‘*accomplished student*’
may stand for one who has only recently completed his course of Vedic
Study.

‘*He should receive*’—honour—all these.

The term ‘*honey-mixture*’ is the name of a rite; and the exact form of
this rite is to be learnt from the *Gṛhyasūtras*.

‘*Parisamvatsarān*,’ ‘*cominy after a year*,’—qualifies the King and
other persons to be honoured. The term means ‘over whom one year has
passed.’ The meaning is that they are entitled to the honour of the
‘honey-mixture,’ if they come after a year, not before that.

Some people explain the verse to mean that if they, happen to come
before the year, then, even though the full year may not have elapsed
since the last offering was made, yet they are to receive the offering.
Hut others hold that the honouring here prescribed is an annual
function; and not as often as they may come; and under this view, the
mere fact of their coming before the year is entirely out cannot be an
obstacle to the honour being offered.

Another reading is ‘*parisamvatsarāt*;’ which means that the honour is
to be held in abeyance for a year; after that they should be
honoured.—(119)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Priyaḥ*’—‘Son-in-law’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘Friend’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Parisaṃvatsarān*’—Kullūka reads ‘*parisaṃvatsarāt*.’

“The Mahābhārata has here *parisaṃvatsaroṣitān*, ‘gone a year on a
journey.’”—(Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 454) as laying down
the ‘Madhuparka’ offering for the King and some others.

*Medhātithi* (Footnote, p. 237.)—The printed editions have wrongly
treated the verse ‘*yadyadiṣṭatamam &c*.’ as Manu’s text. It is only a
part of Medhātithi’s comment, quoted by him as the ‘*Smṛtyantara*’
referred to by him in line 16.

*Gautama* (5.28-30).—‘The Priest, the Teacher, the Father-in-law, the
paternal uncle and the maternal uncle,—when these arrive the
Honey-mixture is to be offered; again on the lapse of a year; and also
before the marriage and the sacrifice.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.8.5-9).—‘The Vedic Scholar deserves the cow
and the honey-mixture; as also the Teacher, the Priest, the Accomplished
Student, and the King, if he be righteous; to the Teacher, the Priest,
the Father-in-law and the King, the cow and the Honey-mixture shall be
offered when they come after the lapse of one year; the Honey-mixture
consists of curd mixed with honey, or water mixed with honey, or, in the
absence of other things, water only.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.1).—‘Six persons deserve to be honoured: the Priest, the
bridegroom, the king, the paternal uncle, the Accomplished Student and
the maternal uncle.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.109-110).—‘One shall offer either a big bull or a big
goat to the Vedic scholar, as also honour, attendance, delicious food
and sweet words; once every year are to be entertained the Accomplished
Student, the Teacher, the King; as also the friend and the bridegroom,
and the Priests when going to officiate at a sacrifice.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (1.24.1-4).—‘After having appointed the Priest,
he shall offer to him the Honey-mixture; also to an Accomplished Student
that may happen to arrive; also to the King, the Teacher, the
Father-in-law, the paternal uncle and the maternal uncle.’

*Pāraskara* (1.3. 1-3).—‘Six persons deserve to be honoured: the
Teacher, the Bridegroom, the King, the dear friend, and the Accomplished
Student; these shall be entertained once every year; also the Priests
that are going to officiate at a sacrifice.’

*Gobhila* (4.10.23-26).—‘Six persons are deserving of the honour of
entertainment: the Teacher, the Priest, the Accomplished Student, the
Bridegroom, the dear friend and the guest; these should be entertained
after the lapse of one year; and also at marriage and at a sacrifice.’

Some people hold that this verse serves to prescribe the honouring even
before the lapse of a year, if the persons happen to Arrive in
connection with a sacrifical peformance. Others, however, take it as
completing what has been said in the preceding verse; and if it be not
taken in this sense, then the statement ‘not if there is no sacrifice’
remains inexplicable.

The term ‘*learned man*’ here may be taken as standing either for the
person spoken of above as ‘accomplished student,’ or for the Priest; it
is for the latter that the offering of ‘Honey-mixture,’ when the
sacrifice is going to be performed, has been laid down. Though one would
perform the Soma-sacrifice several times during the year, yet the
Priests would help in the performance only if they have been duly
honoured. Thus it is only if taken in this sense that the text comes to
have a well-established basis (in the Veda). In any other sense, it will
have to have its basis assumed.

Others, however, take the term ‘*learned man*’ as referring to the
Priest and all the rest of them (mentioned in the preceding verse). In
fact, Gautama has said this in a general way: Having said that ‘the
honey-mixture is to be offered in the reception of the priest, the
father-in-law, the paternal uncle and the maternal uncle, (5-25), he
says ‘before the sacrifice and the marriage’ (5.27). And from this it is
clear that at the time that a sacrifice is going to be performed, all
those who deserve to be honoured should be honoured even before the
lapse of the year.

‘*Not if there is no sacrifice*;’—this prohibition applies to the
honouring before t he year is over, and not that which comes after it.

In connection with the second foot of the verse, there are several
readings:

Some people read ‘*tate yajñe upasthitau*,’ ‘who arrive when a sacrifice
has commenced;’ and they explain this to mean that ‘the honey-mixture’
is to be offered to them only if they come, by invitation, when the
performance of the sacrifice *has commenced*, and not when it is only
*going to be commenced*.

This view is objected to by some persous: In view of the general rule
that ‘the person initiated for sacrifice should not offer anything,’ all
offering is prohibited for the initiated sacrificer; so that, if the
offering of honey-mixture were now permitted, this would be contrary to
the said general rule. It will not be right to argue (in answer to this
that—“this is not an *offering*, since the injunction is that he *should
honour them*, so that it is *honouring* that is enjoined;” because in
the rite of the ‘Honey-mixture, ‘there is an actual *offering* of curd,
as also of meat and food. If it be said that “the man eats what belongs
to another person (without the latter *offering* it),”—in that case, the
act would involve the sin of theft. It may be argued that, “in view of
the direct assertion permitting such an act, it could not be regarded as
*theft*.” But in that case, the act of *giving* is there; in fact, th e
*giving* or *offering* also is actually enjoined in such texts as
‘should offer the honey-mixture.’ Hence the act would be contrary to
law. “The offering would be contrary to the law that ‘the Initiated
Sacrificer should not offer anything,’ only if the term ‘Sacrifice’
always stood for the *Soma-sacrifice* (in connection with which we have
the said prohibition); as a matter of fact, however, the terra stands
for the *Darśa- Pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices also; and the present injunction
may be taken as pertaining to these latter.” This also will not be
right; as, in this case, it will be contrary to usage: as a matter of
fact, cultured people do not offer the Honey-mixture to honoured persons
at any other sacrifice except the Soma-sacrifice; and Usage always
follows the Veda.

For all these reasons, the right reading is ‘*yajñakarmaṇyupasthite*’
(as we have explained already). As a matter of fact, it is only when an
honoured person arrives when the sacrificial performance is going to
commence that cultured persons receive him with the Honey-mixture; and
not after the performance has commenced. For this reason we do not even
stop to consider the point that the prohibition (of offering by the
Initiated Person) pertains to the act of *giving* in general, and not to
that act of *offering or giving* which has been enjoined in connection
with the sacrifice itself.

The compound ‘*yajñakarma*’ is to be expounded as the *Karmadhāraya*
compound: when this performance is approaching—going to be
performed.—(120)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“According to one opinion, given by Medhātithi, and according to
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa, this rule is a limitation of verse
119, and means that the two persons mentioned shall not receive the
‘Honey-mixture,’ except when they come dining the performance of a
sacrifice, however long a period may have elapsed since their last
visit—According to another explanation, mentioned by Medhātithi, and
according to Nandaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the verse means that a King and a
Śrotriya, who come, after a year since their last visit on the occasion
of a sacrifice, shall receive the *Madhuparka*.—The term ‘*Śrotriya*’
refers, according to Medhātithi, to a *Snātaka* or to an officiating
priest;—according to ‘others’ quoted by him, to all the persons
mentioned in the preceding verse;—according to Govindarāja, Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, to a *Snātaka*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455) in support of
the view that *Madhuparka* is to be offered to a King only if he is also
a ‘*Śrotriya*,’ ‘learned in the Veda’, not otherwise;—‘*Śrotriyaḥ*’
being taken as qualifying ‘*rājā*.’—It is difficult to see how the
writer will construe the term ‘*Sampūjyau*’ (in the dual number).

The first cooking has been described: the second rooking is now
described.

‘*Evening*’—end of day, the advent of night; out(?) of the food cooked
at that time all the rites pertaining to the ‘Fire Sacrifices’ have to
be repeated, with the exception of the ‘*Brahmayajña*’ (Vedic Study) and
the ‘*Pitṛyajña*’ (*Śrāddha*).

“All that the text says is that she should offer the ‘Bali-oblation;’
and in ordinary usage it is only the⁴ *Bhūtayajña*’ (the offering to
elementals) that is called ‘*bali*.’ So that, whence do we get (out of
the words of the Text) either the pouring of libations into fire, or the
offering of food to guests &c.? in answer to this the following might be
urged—‘The offering prescribed in the verse is spoken of by the name
*Vaiśvadeva*, and the term, *Vaiśradeva*, denotes that the offering is
meant *for all*, being prescribed for *all gods* (*viśve devāḥ*). In
fact the term, *both morning and evening*, clearly indicates that the
offering in the evening is to be precisely similar to that in the
morning; it is for the purpose of conveying this sense that the term
*morning* has been used. If it were not so, then, since the *morning*
-offering has been already prescribed before, why should it have been
necessary to say here that it has been enjoined for both *morning and
evening*?” But in that case, the *Brahmayajña* and the *Pitṛyajña* also
should have to be performed (in the evening also),”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—The phrase ‘*out of the food
cooked*’ clearly indicates the doing of that alone which can be done
with the *food*,— and not of the *Brahmayajña*, which is done by means
of *Vedic Study*, nor of ‘*Tarpaṇa*’ (), which is done with *water*. We
construe the words of the Text as follows ‘*out of the food cooked, the
Bali-oblation should be offered*, and this rite, called Vaiśvadeva, is
prescribed as to be done out of the food cooked, both morning and
evening.’ That such is the meaning we deduce from the use of the term
‘*food*’ and that of the term ‘*vaiśvadeva*

‘*Without sacred formulas*;’—what is interdicted is the use of
expressions containing the names of the deity and ending with the
syllable ‘*svāhā*;’ such expressions, for instance, as ‘*agnaye svāhā*,’
and the like; no other sacred formulas have been prescribed in
connection with the *Vaiśvadeva* offerings; the said expressions are
called ‘sacred formulas’ (*mantra*) only with a view to eulogise them;
the real character of ‘*mantra*’ cannot belong to any expressions not
occurring in the Veda; all students of Veda accept that only as
‘*mantra*’ which forms part of the Veda, either in the form of *Ṛk,
Yajuṣ* or *Sāman*; and the meaning of words is ascertained from usage
only. Those expressions with which the *Bali* and other oblations are
made are not found in the text of any Veda; all that the *Śruti* says is
that ‘oblations should be offered to Agni and other deities;’ the use of
the syllable ‘*svāhā*’ also in the offering of all oblations is enjoined
in another text, which says that ‘oblations are offered to gods either
with the syllable *svāhā* or *vaṣaṭ*;’ but the use of the syllable
‘*vaṣiṭ*’ has been restricted to the end of the ‘*yājyā*’ *mantras* only
by the declaration ‘one should pronounce *vaṣaṭ* at the end of the
*yājyā*.’ In connection with the syllable ‘*svāhā*,’ the grammatical
rules lay down the use of the Dative affix. Thus it is that it becomes
necessary to use such verbal expressions as ‘*agnaye svāhā*,’ and the
like, because every secrificial offering is aimed for a deity, and it is
only by means of words that we know for which deity it is aimed.

“Under the circumstances, as the use of these expressions is prohibited,
how can the sacrifice he regarded as accomplished? For so long as the
gift is not completed by the assertion ‘this is for you, it is no longer
mine,’ the sacrifice cannot be regarded as accomplished. Merely giving
up a thing, without special reference to a recipient, cannot be called a
‘sacrifice’.”

This is true: the verbal reference to the gods being prohibited, the
wife shall make the reference mentally.Just as when the *Śūdra*
pronounces the syllable ‘*namḥ*,’ the use of the Mantra being replaced
in his case by that syllable—as declared by Gautama, who says ‘For the
*Śūdra* the syllable *namaḥ* has been ordained as the *mantra*’ (10.64);
and the utterance of the name of the deity is not permitted for him. And
yet it has been declared that even in this case the offering to the
Deity becomes duly accomplished. The revered teachers, however, have
declared that it is only the syllabic ‘*svāhā*’ that is to be replaced
by the syllable ‘*namaḥ*,’ and that the utterance of the name of the
Deity has not been prohibited.

*Question*:—“ Who is the real performer of the Vaiśvadeva offering in
the evening?”

*Answer*:—It has been already asserted that it is the wife, who will
make the offering without mantras; and this because she will be near
by.—(121)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 315), which adds the
following notes:—The first sentence here extends upto ‘*nāmaitat*’;
‘*sāyamprātarvidhīyate*’ being a totally distinct sentence; the latter
serves to enjoin the necessity of making the *Vaiśvadeva-offering* both
morning and evening. The meaning thus comes to be that it is only in the
evening that the wife is entitled to perform the ‘*Vaiśvadeva rite*’ *in
the form of the Bali-offering*. Some people hold that the
‘Bali-offering’ herein laid down as to be done by the wife indicates the
*Vaiśvadeva* offering also, and is not meant to be a substitute for the
latter.

It is quoted also in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 929), which 1ms the
following notes:—One sentence runs up to ‘*nāmaitat*’, and
‘*sāyamprātarvidhīyate*’ is another sentence, laying down the two times
for *Vaiśvadeva* offering. It is to this *offering* in the evening alone
that the wife is entitled; and it is not right, as some people have
held, that the name ‘*Vaiśvadeva*’ here stands for the entire rite of
that name, including the *Homa* also; because *Homa* has been expressly
forbidden for women. Others again have held that the singular number in
‘*balim*’ indicates that the only offering that the wife is to make is
that which is made in the sky, *i*.*e*., the ‘*Vaihāyasa-bali*’. But
this also is not right; because in the same context as the present,
another text uses the plural form, ‘*balīn haret*’. Thus the conclusion
is that the entire offering is to be made in the evening either by the
man or his wife.

The verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), which adds
the following explanation:—*Bali-offering* without mantras, with food
cooked in the evening, is to be done by the wife only in the absence of
the House-holder and his sons;—‘*Homa*’ by women being generally
interdicted by several texts.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 145) which explains it to mean that—‘*in
the absence of males*, the wife should offer *Vaiśvadeva-bali* without
mantras.’

*Gobhila* (1. 4.19).—‘The Bali is to be offered by the woman in the
evening, and by the man in the morning.’

*Gautama* (Aparārka, p. 145).—‘The Vaiśvadeva-offering and the
Bali-offering should be made both morning and evening, even though the
man himself may not take any food.’

121	But the wife shall offer in the evening (a portion) of the dressed food as a Bali-oblation, without (the recitation of) sacred formulas; for that (rite which is called the) Vaisvadeva is prescribed both for the morning and the evening.
