In matters regauding ‘Dharma’, the Brāhmaṇa is the Lord of this whole world;—because he sprang out of the best part of (Prajāpati’s) body, because he is the eldest ok all, and because he upholds the Veda.—(98)

This verse explains what follows from what has been said in the
preceding verse. ‘*The best part of the body*,’—the head; from out of
that sprang, was born, the Brāhmaṇa.—He is also ‘*the eldest of
all*,’—the Brāhmaṇa was produced before the other castes .— ‘*Because he
upholds the Brahman, i.e., Veda*’; the upholding of the Veda has been
specifically prescribed for him.—‘*Hence*,’—for all these three
reasons,—‘*the Brāhmaṇa is the lord*,’—*i.e*., as if he were the lord
—‘*of this whole world*’; *i.e*., he should be approached (treated) like
the lord; and people should obey his orders in matters relating to
*Dharma.—‘Dharmataḥ prabhuḥ*’ means ‘*dharme prabhuḥ*,’—‘Lord in matters
regarding *Dharma*,’—the affix ‘*tasi*’ (in ‘*dharmataḥ*’) being added
according to the *Vārtika* on Pāṇini 5.4.44, which lays down the use of
this affix in connection with such terms as ‘*ādya*’ and the like. (93)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Dharmataḥ prabhuḥ*’—‘The lord, by law’—according to Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana. But Medhātithi takes it to mean that ‘*he is the lord, in
matters relating to Dharma*’; *i.e*., he is the person entitled to
prescribe the duties of men and as such, is like the lord;—Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda accept the latter explanation.

Him the Sself-existent one, after performing austerities, created, in the beginning, out of his own mouth, for the conveying of offerings (to the gods) and of oblations (to the Pitṛs), and for the preservation of this entire creation. (94).

</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse serves the purpose of pointing out the details of the three
reasons set forth in the preceding verse.

In the case of the ordinary man also, the head is the most important
part of his body. ‘*Him*’—the Brāhmaṇa;—‘*Self-existent one created*
*out of* *his* *own* *mouth*’; and this creation out of his mouth came
about after he had performed austerities.

The fact of the Brāhmaṇa being the ‘*eldest*’ is vindicated by the term
‘*in the beginning*.’

That which is done for the benefit of the Gods is called ‘*offering*’;
and that which is done for the benefit of the *Pitṛs* is called
‘*oblation*’;—‘*for the conveying of*’ these two,—*i.e*., for presenting
them to the Gods and the *Pitṛs*. In the term ‘*abhivāhyāya*,’ the
verbal affix (*ṇyat*) has the nominal force, which may be explained
somehow or other; the root ‘*vaḥ*’ being transitive.

By the said act (of conveying the oblations and offerings) is
accomplished ‘*the preservation*,’—nourishment—of this whole Trio of
Worlds: the gods live upon offerings made from this world (by men),—the
Gods again nourish plants and herbs and make them ripe by means of cold,
heat and rains; this mutual benefit leads to ‘*preservation*.’ (94).

**(Verse 94-99)

*Yājñavalkya*, 1.198-109.—‘Having performed austerities, Brahmā created
the Brāhmaṇas, for the guarding of the Vedas, for the satisfaction of
Pitṛs and Gods and for the protection of Dharma. Those Brāhmaṇas who are
devoted to learning and study, are the source of everything, superior to
these are those who are devoted to religious acts; and superior even to
these are those who are the best knowers of the science of the self.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The author proceeds to show the above-mentioned ‘conveying of
oblations.’

‘*Tṛdivaukasaḥ*’—are those whose habitation consists of the ‘third
heaven,’ *i.e*., the denizens of heaven, the Gods.—The Gods accept the
food that is eaten by the Brāhmaṇa: in connection with ‘*Śrāddha*’
offerings also, the feeding of Brāhmaṇas has been laid down as to be
done for the sake of the *Viśvedevas* (a class of Gods),—this feeding
being a part of the offering to the *Pitṛs*. What is stated in the text
is with reference to these facts.

‘*What being is superior*’—*i.e*. greater—‘*to him*’—than him? This
means that the author himself ‘forgets’ (cannot think of) any being who
could be so superior.

The Gods, occupying the highest regions, and the *Pitṛs* occupying the
intermediate regions,—both are imperceptible; hence there is no other
means of feeding them except though the feeding of Brāhmaṇas;—hence the
Brāhmaṇa must be superior. (95).

The word ‘being’ stands for all such things on earth as Trees and other
immovable things, and also such movable

things as insects, beetles and the like.—Among these, the ‘*animated
ones*’—*i.e*., those that are capable of such activities as eating,
moving and so forth,—are ‘*foremost*’; being aminated, they experience
more powerful pleasures.—Among these latter, ‘*those that subsist by
reason*,’—*i.e*., those that discriminate between wholesome and
unwholesome, such for instance, as dogs, jackals and other animals \[are
foremost\]; these animals, when suffering from heat, more into the
shade; when suffering from cold, they betake themselves to the sun; they
give up a place where they find no food.—Among these latter again, ‘*men
are foremost*’; and of them, ‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’ They are the most highly
honoured; they are never ill treated by any person; in fact the killing
of the Brāhmaṇa involves a serious expiatory rite, which is due entirely
to considerations of caste. (96).

The peculiarity of the Brāhmaṇa endowed with the qualities of learning
and the like having been described, some people might be led to
ill-treat the mere Brāhmaṇa by birth; hence with a view to prevent this,
the author has added this verse.

‘*The very genesis*’—*i.e*., irrespective of his qualities, his mere
birth, the mere ‘Brāhmaṇa caste’—‘*is the eternal* *incar*
*nation*’—body—‘*of Virtue*.’

‘*Born for the sake of virtue*,’—when the Brāhmaṇa has been duly
initiated with the rites of initiation, this is what constitutes his
‘*being horn for the sake of Virtue*’; and ‘*this* *birth leads to the
state of Brahman*’; on abandoning the ‘body of Virtue’, the Brāhmaṇa
becomes the partaker of Supreme Bliss.—says the *Śruti*. (98).

‘*Brahma*’—stands here for the Highest Spiritual Being; and not for the

being absorbed into Brahman, the Supreme Self.’

Whatever is contained in this world is all the property of the Brāhmaṇa; the Brāhmaṇa verily deserves all by virtue of his superiority and noble birth. (100).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Having raised the question that, if the Brāhmaṇa happen to be
discontented and should again undertake to receive gifts, he would incur
sin,—the Author offers his answer to it in this verse.

‘*All this*’—*i.e.*, whatever wealth exists in the three worlds—‘*is the
property of the Brāhmaṇa*’; so that for him there can he no ‘acceptance
of gifts’; what he takes possession of, he does by virtue of his being
its possessor, and not as the receiver of a gift.

This is mere praise, not an injunction; hence we have the word
‘*deserves*’.

‘*Noble birth*’—high hirth, superior character. (100). VERSE CI.

What the Brāhmaṇa eats as a guest in the house of others is really his
own; it should not be thought that he is receiving food from another
person’s kitchen.—Similarly ‘*what he wears is his own*’;—*i.e*., when
he obtains clothing, either by begging or otherwise, it does not mean
that he has acquired it from others; what it means is that he is
employing what is *his own* in the covering of his body.—What he obtains
for his own use, in that he may lie exercising his own right of
possession; hut when he gives away to people what belongs to others,
this also is nothing wrong for him; it is only his *good will*,
benevolence. It is by reason of the large-heartedness of the Brāhmaṇa
that Kings on earth enjoy their possessions; otherwise, if the Brāhmaṇa
were to wish—‘I should take all this and apply it to my own use,’—then
all others would become penniless, having nothing that they could use
for their own benefit.—(101)

This verse serves the purpose of indicating the upshot of the entire
eulogium pronounced on the Brāhmaṇa (in the foregoing verses);—\[the
sense being\]—‘These institutes are so important that they serve the
purposes of the Brāhmana who is endowed with a high degree of supremacy
due to his own inherent excellence’;—‘*for the puryose of regulating the
actions*,’—*i.e*. for the purposes of *regulating*, in the form ‘such
and such acts should be done, and such and such others should be
avoided’;—‘*of others also*,’ *i.e*. of the *Kṣatriya* and the
rest;—‘*Incidentally*,’—*i.e*. primarily for the Brāhmaṇa, and only
incidentally for the *Kṣatriya* and other castes;—‘*he elaborated*.’—set
forth,—‘*these institutes* .’—(102)
