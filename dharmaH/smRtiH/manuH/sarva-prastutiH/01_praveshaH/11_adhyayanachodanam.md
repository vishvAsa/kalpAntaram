<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

*Adhyetavyam-pravaktovyam’—‘can be studied and can be taught*’—the
verbal affix denotes *capability*, not *injunction* \[ *i.e*. the
meaning is that the institutes *deserve* to be studied and taught &c.\];
for actual injunctions are going to begin only from the Second Discourse
onward; and the present Discourse is purely descriptive, it contains no
injunctions. Hence, just as the assertion, ‘Rice forms the food of
Kings,’ is regarded as a mere praise of the Rice, and it is not taken us
a prohibition of its eating by people other than Kings,—in the same
manner, in the present passage the phrase ‘*not by any one else*’ is not
a prohibition (of study by others), but only a praise of the institutes;
the sense thus is as follows:—

‘The Brāhmaṇa is the highest being in the world,—these institutes are
the best of all institutes,—hence these are capable of being studied and
taught only by the said learned Brāhmaṇa,—and they cannot be either
studied or taught by any ordinary man.’ It is in view of this that the
author adds the term ‘*with great care*’; unless great care is taken,
until the self has been duly equipped with the knowledge of other
sciences,—such as Logic, Grammar and Exigetics,—these institutes cannot
be taught. Thus it is that ‘*study*’ implies ‘hearing’ (from the lips of
the Teacher) also; and the justification for this implication lies in
the fact that the ‘learning’ (spoken of by the epithet ‘*learned*’)
comes in useful only in the case of *hearing* from the teacher’s
lips,—(which presupposes intelligent following of the oral lectures); it
would not be necessary for the mere *reading of the words*. If the
present verse were taken as an injunction of ‘study,’ the said
‘learning’ could he regarded only as serving some transcendental
purpose. It would not he right to argue that—“in the injunction also
*hearing* would be implied by the *studying*”; for it is not right to
take what is *enjoined* as subserving the purposes of implications. In
the case of Declamatory passages (Arthavāda) on the other hand, there is
nothing incongruous in admitting of indirect implications on the basis
of other sources of knowledge (while a direct Injunction by its very
nature, cannot be diverted from its direct meaning, on any account
whatsoever\],

From all this it follows that all three castes are entitled to the study
of the Institutes. This we shall explain in detail later on.—(103)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in the *Mitākṣarā* (on I, 3)—along with another
verse from Manu (2-16)—in support of the view that, though all the three
twice-born castes are entitled to *study* the *Dharmaśāstra*, the
Brāhmaṇa alone is entitled to teach it. In support of this it also
quotes a text from *Śaṅkha* to the effect that the Brāhmaṇa alone is
entitled to these, and it is he that explains their duties to the other
castes. To this same view we find the verse quoted in the Vīramitrodaya
(Saṃskāra, p. 512);—also in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 10) which
reads *vidvadbhiḥ* for ‘*śisyebhyaḥ*’ and explains it as meant simply to
exclude the Śūdra only.

Having thus, indirectly through its co-relative, eulogised the
Institutes as serving the purposes of the Brāhmaṇa, the Author now
proceeds to eulogise them directly.

Knowing these Institutes, the Brāhmaṇa, comes to ‘*discharge all
prescribed duties*,’—*i.e*. he observes all observances and practises
full self-control; having learnt from the institutes that the omission
of duties is sinful, he, fearing sin, fulfils all active and passive
obligations (relating to observances and self-control),—doing everything
in full conformity to the Institutes. Thus fulfilling all his duties,
‘*he is not defiled*’—affected—‘*by the sins*’ arising from the omission
of duties prescribed and the commission of deeds prohibited.—(104)

‘*Kindreds*’—persons born in his own family ;—‘*seven higher*,’ those

‘*Svasti*,’ ‘*Welfare*’—is the non-hindrance (fulfilment) of what is
desired; ‘*dyana*’ ‘*conducive*,’ is that which brings about; hence
‘*svastyayana*,’ ‘*conducive to welfare*,’ means that which brings about
the fulfilment of what is desired.

‘*Most excellent*’—in comparison to such acts as the telling of beads,
pouring of libations and so forth; without this treatise the performance
of such acts is not possible; hence as leading to their performance, it
is described as ‘*most important*.’ Or, it may mean that the words and
sentences that serve to bring about the knowledge of virtue are
*excellent*; while the actual performance is painful; hence the former
are spoken of as ‘*most excellent*.’

‘*It expands the intellect*’—when the treatise is duly studied, its
subject-matter becomes illuminated, and the hard knots become untied;
hence follows the *expansion of the understanding*, as is well known.

‘*it brings fame*,’—when a man knows Dharma his opinion is sought for by
enquirers, and thus he acquires fame. The term ‘*Yaśasyam*’ means *that
which is the cause of fame*’, ‘*fame*’ consists in being known as
possessing the qualities of learning, nobility and so forth.

‘*The highest good*’—It brings about the due knowledge of Actions and
Wisdom, which lead to the attainment of bliss unalloyed with pain, such
bliss appearing in the form of ‘Heaven’ and ‘Final Release’; and for
this reason this treatise constitutes the ‘*highest*,’ most excellent,
‘*good*’—(106).

The Author now proceeds to describe the fact that his treatise, in
regard to its subject-matter, is complete in itself, and does not stand
in need of anything else.

That which is called ‘*Dharma*,’ ‘*is expounded*,’ in this Treatise,
‘*in its entirety*,’ wholly; that is, for acquiring the knowledge of
*Dharma*, one need not have recourse to any other treatise. This is a
hyperbolic eulogium; what is meant is only that *such Dharma as is
adumbrated in the Smṛtis* has been expounded in its entirety in this
Treatise.

‘*The good and had features of actions*,’—the desirable and undesirable
results form the ‘*good and bad features of actions*’—*i.e*. of such
actions as *sacrifice* and *Brāhmāṇa-killing* (respectively).
‘*Entirety*’ refers to the details relating to (1) the form of the acts,
(2) their procedure, (3) their results, also (4) their relation to a
particular kind of Agent, and (5) their distinction into ‘compulsory’
and ‘optional’;—it is all this that is meant by the term ‘*good and bad
features'* ‘*Dharma*’ having been already mentioned in the preceding
clause, the mention again of the term ‘*action*’ (which means the same
thing) is for the purpose of filling up the verse.

‘*Of all the four castes*’;—this also is meant to indicate the complete
charactcr of the Treatise; the meaning being that ‘whoever is entitled
to the performance of *Dharma* can derive his knowledge of it from this
Treatise’.

‘*Eternal morality*’—*Dharma* or Action, based upon, indicated by,
Morality is what is called ‘*Eternal Morality*’ here; *i.e*. Right
Behaviour. This we shall examine in detail under Discourse II (verse 4).
‘*Eternal*’—*i.e*. established by long-tradition, not merely set up by
people of the present day.—(107).

This verse eulogises Right Behaviour iu another manner.

‘*He who departs from Right behaviour*,’—*i.e*. is devoid of Right
Conduct—does not obtain the ‘*fruit of the Veda*’; what is called ‘*the
fruit of the Veda* is the result proceeding from the performance of acts
prescribed in the Veda. Even though the man may perform the acts
prescribed in the Veda, in their entire and perfect forms, yet if he
happens to be one who has fallen off from Right Behaviour, he does not
obtain their results, in the shape of the ‘birth of a son’ and so forth.
This is the deprecation of men not following Eight Behaviour.

This same idea is expressed obversely in the next sentence.

‘*He who is equipped with Right Behaviour obtains the full reward*,’—of
all those optional acts that are done with a purpose.

In this connection some people argue as follows:—“In as much as the text
contains the qualification ‘full,’ it follows that the man devoid of
Right Behaviour does also obtain the results of his optional acts done
with a purpose,—only the *full* result does not accrue to them.”

This is not right; because the term ‘full’ is purely commendatory \[and
hence cannot be taken as having any serious import\].—(109).
