Virtue is that which has “four feet.” What constitutes ‘virtue’ is the
action of sacrifice and the like; and as this latter is something to he
performed, it has no body; hence the word ‘feet’ in the text cannot be
taken as denoting the part of a body; it stands for ‘part’ or ‘factor.’
As a matter of fact, Virtue has no body, either like men or like birds
and animals. Hence what is meant by Virtue having all its ‘four feet’ is
that it is equipped with all its four factors. The meaning of the text
thus is that such virtue as is perfect and equipped with its four
factors existed in the *Kṛta* Cycle.—\[*The* ‘*four factors’ are now
illustrated*\]—At the sacrifice, when it is in course of performance,
there are four priests—viz., the ‘*Hotṛ*,’ the ‘*Brahman*,’ the
‘*Udgātṛ*’ and the ‘*Adhvaryu*’;—of the performers there are *four
castes*, or *four life-stages*. ‘*Virtue*’ as it is described in the
Veda was performed during that cycle in its entire and perfect form;
*i.e*., it was not deficient in even the smallest factor, and it was not
wanting in any of its details. The number ‘four’ is applicable to Virtue
in many ways. For instance, in the case of the action of ‘giving’ also,
there is the giver, the thing given, the recipient and his satisfaction.
Or the ‘four factors’ of Virtue may be sacrifice, charity, austerity,
and knowledge. This would he in accordance with what is going to be
described in verse 86 as regards ‘Austerity’ being the chief virtue in
the *Kṛta age*.

Or, the term ‘*Dharma*’ ‘*Virtue*’ in the text, may be taken as standing
for the *words descriptive of Virtue*; and of such words the ‘four feet’
are the four kinds of words—Nouns, Verbs, Prepositions and
Indeclinables. This is thus declared in *Ṛgveda* 1.164.45—‘There are
four words contained in speech, these the wise Brāhmaṇas know’—(in this
passage) the epithet ‘*manīsiṇaḥ*,’ ‘*wise*,’ stands for those ‘who are
of powerful minds,’ *i.e*., learned, virtuous;—(the passage goes on)
‘these, placed in the cave, do not appear to view,’—*i.e*., are not
perceptible—‘the fourth speech people speak’—the fourth, people versed
in the Veda speak. The meaning of this passage is that—‘in the
beginning, no Vedic sentence was hidden from view, nor was any Vedic
Rescensional Text lost, while now a days, much has become lost.’

‘*So does truth*,’—that is, truth also exsists in its perfect form.
Though truth also, being what is prescribed in the Veda, is a ‘virtue’
(and as such already included in the latter term), yet it has been
separately mentioned with a view to show its special importance, or to
indicate that it forms the basis of all virtues, the performance of
‘virtue’ in its entire form is based upon truth; and those who are
untruthful, perform, for the purpose of gaining popularity, only a part
of what constitutes ‘virtue’ and ignore the rest of it.

‘*By vice*’—*i.e*., by following the prohibited path ,—‘*no benefit*’—in
the shape of either *learning* or wealth,—‘*accrues*’—comes—to the
performer; this is by virtue of the special character of the age.
(During that age) men do not acquire learning, nor do they earn wealth,
by vicious means. Learning and wealth are the means by which virtuous
acts are performed; hence when it is said that these are pure, what is
meant is that this is what tends to virtue being performed in its entire
and perfect form—(81).

Dharma with its ‘four feet’ is a common idea in Hinduism. In VIII. 16 we
have the picture of Dharma as a ‘bull’; its ‘four feet’ have been
variously identified:—(*a*) according to Medhātithi, they represent the
four principal sacrificial priests—*Adhvaryu*, *Hotṛ*, *Brahman* and
*Udgātṛ*;—(*b*) he also suggests, along with Nandana, that they may
stand for the four castes;—(*c*) they have been held by Medhātithi,
Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa to stand for the four means of acquiring
merit—*Tapas, Jñāna, Yajña* and *Dāna*;—(*d*) and last, they have been
identified by Medhātithi with the four kinds of speech described in
*Ṛgveda* 1.164.45—‘Three being hidden in the cave and the fourth being
spoken by men.’

‘*Satyam*’—Though included in ‘*Dharma*,’ this has been mentioned
separately, for the purpose of showing its special importance. The
*Aparārka* (p. 1012) quotes the first line of this verse as showing the
diverse character of the various cycles.—The verse is quoted in the
Vīramitrodaya—Parībhāṣā, p. 50.

In the Cycles other than the *Kṛta*;—‘*from the scriptures*,’ called
‘Veda’;—‘*virtue*’—‘*foot by foot*’—by one foot in each succeeding
Cycle,—‘*fell off*,’ was carried away;—the Vedic Texts disappeared, by
reason of the deterioration in the powers of learning and assimilating
of men (le arning the texts).

The ‘*virtuous acts*’—in the form of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other
sacrifices, that are performed now a days,—these also ‘*deteriorated
foot by foot*’ on account of ‘*theft*’ &c. *i.e*., since Priests,
Sacrifices, Bestowers and Recipients of gifts, are all beset with the
said evils, the virtuous act is not accomplished in the proper manner,
and hence the result mentioned (as accruing from that act) also is not
attained. In as much as this is the real meaning, we do not take
‘*theft*’ and the rest as applied to each of the three Cycles
respectively; specially as all of them (theft &c.,) are found prevalent
even now a days (in *Kali*)—(82).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse also has been variously interpreted:—(*a*) According to
Medhātithi it means that during the *Tretā, Dvāpara*, and *Kali* cycles,
‘Dharma fell off from the scriptures, foot by foot, and that there was
deterioration foot by foot in the fruit of Dharma also,—the reason for
this latter fact lying in the prevalence of theft, falsehood and fraud
*during all these three cycles*’; and he emphasises the fact that theft
eta, are not to be token as pertaining to the three cycles
respectively;—(*b*) according to Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the
meaning is that during the three cycles, *by reason of unjust gains*
(‘*āgamāt*’) Dharma successively loses one foot etc., eta;—(*c*)
Govindarāja agrees with Medhātithi, hut with this difference that he
appears to favour the view that the deterioration in the results of acts
is due to theft, falsehood and fraud *respectively*,—the view that has
been repudiated by Medhātithi;—(*d*) according to Nandana—‘it having
been declared in the preceding verse that in the Kṛta-cycle there were
no scriptures, it is now said that during the other three cycles, Dharma
*is* determined by the scriptures,—and it diminishes successively in
each age by one quarter.’

This verse is quoted in the Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣā, p. 50.

By reason of the absence of vice, which is the cause of disease, men are
‘*free from disease*’; ‘*disease*’stands for *sickness*.—‘All,’ the four
castes, have their desired purposes accomplished; ‘aim’ stands for
purpose; or (it may mean) the results following from all their acts with
purposes are duly obtained; on account of the absence of obstacles,
*all* result are obtained without fail.

‘*Their life lasts through four hundred years*’—“But we find the highest
age described as 1600 years, in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* (3.16.7), where
it is said ‘he lived for sixteen hundred years’.”

It is in view of this that it has been held that the term ‘*hundred
years*’ here stands for the *stages of life*; the meaning thus being
that ‘*they live through all the four stages of life*,’—man’s life is
never shortened, they never die without having reached the fourth stage.
That such is the meaning is shown by the fact that in the second half of
the verse we have the assertion ‘*vayo hrasati*,’ ‘*life becomes
shortened*’; this subsequent mention of the ‘shorterning of life’ would
have some point only if the ‘lengthening of life’ were spoken of in the
preceding sentence.

‘*Quarter by quarter*’—the term ‘quarter’ here does not stand for the
*fourth part*, it stands only for *part*; the meaning being that ‘man’s
life becomes shortened *in part*’, i.e. some die while they are young
children, others on reaching youth, and others on attaining old age; and
the full span of life is difficult to attain.—(83)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Quarter by quarter*’—The natural meaning is that men lived for 400
years during *Kṛta*, 300 years during *Tretā*, 200 years during
*Dvāpara* and 100 years during *Kali* But in view of the assertion in
the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* of a man having lived for 1600 years (3.16.17)
Medhātithi has been forced to remark that ‘quarter’ here stands for
*part*, and not for the precise *fourth part*, and to explain the text
to mean that ‘man’s life becomes shortened *in part*; some die while
they are young children, others on reaching youth and others on
attaining old age.’

The *Aparārka* (p. 1012) quotes the first line in support of the view
that each cycle has a distinct character of its own.

Some people offer the following explanation:—What is meant ‘*the age
spoken of in the Veda*’ is the age of a thousand years and so forth,
which is indicated by the Veda prescribing such rites as are mentioned
as extending over ‘thousand years’; and this age is ‘*obtained*’,
reached, only in accordance with the nature of the Cycle, and not in all
Cycle; for instance, now-a-days no one ever lives for ‘thousand years’
he who lives long, lives for a *hundred* years.

There are others who do not accept this explanation, and for the
following reasons:—It has been decided (under Mīmāmsā-Sutras 6. 7.31-40)
that when the term ‘year’ occurs in the Veda in connection with the long
sacrificial sessions, it stands for ‘days’; so that if something else
(in the shape *of years*) were taken as enjoined, then there would he an
inconsistency, and this would lead to the ‘splitting of the
sentence’;—the text in connection with the subject is in the form
‘*pañcapañc??hatah tṛvṛtaḥ samvatsarāḥ*’, ‘the fifty-five trios, years’
(literally); now hero what is definitely indicated by the context is
that the term ‘trio’ stands for the *three days* of the *??vāmayana*
Sacrifice; so that it is in regard to these that the particular number
(*Fifty-five*) is laid down; under the circumstances, if the sentence,
by virtue of the term ‘*Samvatsarāḥ*’, ‘years’, were taken as laying
down the further unknown fact? the said (*trios*) being ‘years’,—then
there would be a?it in the sentence; in order to avoid this, it becomes
necessary to take one or the other of the words as merely *reite??ive*
(not *injunctive*);—now

as regards the term ‘*Samvatsara*’, ‘year’, we find that, on the basis
of diverse calculations, known as the ‘*Saura*’, the ‘*Sāvana*’ and so
forth, it is often used in a sense other than that of a collection of
exactly *three hundred and sixty day*; so that it is only right that
this term (and not the term ‘*fifty-five*’) should be taken
figuratively, as being descriptive of ‘*days*’.

Others again argue as follows:—Among the *Mantra* and *Arthavāda* texts
of the Veda we find such egressions as—‘The gods live for a *hundred*
years’, ‘the man’s life is of hundred years’, and so forth,—where the
term ‘hundred’ is found used in the sense of ‘*many*’ and ‘man’ is
purely indefinite; hence the meaning (of our text,) is that ‘men are
short-lived or long-lived according to the Cycle’.—If the verse were
taken in its literal sense, it would mean that during *Kali* all men
live for a hundred years, and this would not be true\],—Or, it may mean
that the exact extent of ‘full age’—which is found mentioned as the
result of sacrifices performed by the man desiring *full age*—being
nowhere defined the extent should be taken as determined by the
character of the particular Cycle.

‘*Results*’—i.e., the things desired as results. described in the Veda,
proceeding from acts performed with a purpose.—Though ‘full age’ also is
a *desired result*, yet it has been mentioned separately in view of its
importance; as declared in such words as—‘Full age is the highest
desirable object’.

‘*Power*’—i.e. the superphysio faculties, consisting in being equipped
with *aṇimā* (the faculty of becoming as small as one likes) and such
other faculties’,—or in the form of ability to pronounce effective
curses, as? bestowing effective boons

‘*Are obtained in accordance with the character of the Cycle*’—this has
to be construed with all (three phrases)—(84).

*gauṇa*.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse sums up what has been said in regard to the diversity in the
nature of things based upon the difference in time.

The word ‘*Dharma*’ here is not restricted to the sense of *sacrifice*
and such other acts (prescribed by the Veda); it stands for the
*characteristic* of things in general. The meaning thus is that in each
Cycle, the character of things varies, as shown before (in verses 83 and
84); just as, for instance, the character of things during the Spring is
of one kind, of a different kind during the Summer, and of yet another
kind during the Rains,—so it is in connection with the Cycles also.

By ‘*difference*’ it is not meant that things cease to bring about
effects that they are found (at one time) to produce, and bring about
other effects; what is meant is that they become incapable of bringing
about their complete effects; and this by reason of the decrease in
their potency. This is what is meant by the phrase—‘*this being due to
the deterioration of each succeeding Cycle*,’—‘*deterioration*’ meaning
*inferiority*.—(85).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

Buhler translates the verse to mean that the diversity of *Dharma* is
due to the *decrease in the length* of the yugas. This however is not
countenanced by any of the commentators, all of whom agree that the said
diversity is due to the relative *inferiority* of fine age to the other.

Medhātithi’s interpretation of 85 is not quite consistent with what
follows in 86; but he has taken care to disconnect 85 from 86; he
distinctly says that what is said in 86 is a ‘diversity in the character
of the yugas’ distinct from what has been set forth in 85. Really this
is made clear by the fact that in 85, the word ‘*Dharma*’ stands,
according to Medhātithi, not for duty, but for *characteristic*.

This verse is quoted in Hemādri—Pariśeṣa—Kāla, p. 657;—and in the
Smṛticandrikā—Saṃskāra, p. 27.

In the Kṛta Cycle, ‘Austerity’ is the highest; in the Tretā ‘knowledge’ is described as such; in the Dvāpara they call the ‘Sacrifice’ the highest, and ‘Charity’ alone in the Kali-Cycle—(86).

Another difference in the character of the Cycles is now described.

As a matter of fact, Austerity and the other Virtues are not prescribed
in the Veda with reference to any particular Cycle, all of them should
be performed at all times; hence the description contained in the
present verse has got to be explained somehow or other. In fact it is in
the Itihāsas that the distinction herein set forth is met with. \[When
‘Austerity’ is relegated to the *Kṛta* Cycle\] what is meant is that it
is the principal—and hence the most effective—Virtue cultivated; and the
men being longlived and free from disease are most capable of performing
Austerities.

‘*Knowledge*’—i.e. of spiritual matters. Though the men \[being not
quite so healthy in the *Tretā* as in the *Kṛta* \], suffer in the body,
yet this bodily suffering does not render the internal discipline
(necessary for spiritual knowledge) very difficult.

In as much as there is not much trouble in the performance of
*Sacrifices*, sacrifice forms the chief virtue in *Dvāpara*.

In *Charity*, there is neither physical suffering, nor need for internal
discipline or much learning; hence it is easily done.—(86)
