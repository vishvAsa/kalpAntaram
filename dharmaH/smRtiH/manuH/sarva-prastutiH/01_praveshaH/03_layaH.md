‘*When that Divine Being is awake*—*i*. *e*., when he wills, that ‘this
world may come into being and may continue to exist for such a
time,’—‘*then this world is active*’; that is, it becomes accompanied by
such internal activities as mental, verbal and material, and such
external activities as inspiration, respiration, eating, walking,
cultivation, sacrifice and so forth.

‘*When he slumbers*’—when his will desists from the creation and
maintaining of the world,—‘*then* *all vanishes*,’ undergoes absorption.

‘Waking’ and ‘sleeping’ here stand respectively for the *prevalence* and
*cessation* of his will.

‘*With his mind in calm repose*’—means that he has withdrawn from his
state of diversity.—(52)

The meaning of this verse is quite clear, its meaning having been
already explained.

‘*Having retired within himself*’—*i.e*., in calm repose, i *e*., in
pure pristine nature of the Soul at rest;—‘*retiring within himself*’
stands for the cessation of all accidental diversities.

‘*Active*’—the conscious beings who are fallen in the cycle of births
and deaths, and for whom *Action* is of the greatest
importance;—‘*embodied beings*,’—so called because they feel the effects
of being connected with a body which is the effect of their own past
acts.

‘*When he slumbers*,’ all these ‘*desist from their actions*,’—this
stands for the cessation of their *bodily* activity;—‘*their mind falls
into depression*’—this stands for the cessation of their mental
activity. Thus this cessation of bodily and mental activities indicates
the state of Dissolution.—‘*Depression*’ means absence of energy,
disability to carry on its functions; this is what the Mind *falls
into*,—attains.—(53)

‘*Karmāṭmānaḥ*’—It is not correct to say, as Buhler does, that this term
according to Medhātithi, means ‘who, in consequence of their actions,
become incorporate because as a matter of fact, this latter explanation
is supplied. by Medhātithi in reference to the term ‘*śarīriṇaḥ*’; what
he means is that th e Beings are called ‘*śarīriṇaḥ*’ not because the
Body is their natural accompaniment, but because they become equipped
with, them in consequence of their acts,

This verse has to he explained by reversing the position of ‘when’ and
‘then’; otherwise, from what has been said in the foregoing verses,
there would be mutual interdependence: it has been stated (in Verse 52)
that *when He sleeps then all things vanish* \[and if the persent verse
is taken to mean, as the words suggest, that when the things vanish into
the Great Soul, then this Great Soul retires to sleep, then we would
have the vanishing of things dependent upon his going to sleep, as
stated in 52, and his going to sleep dependent upon the vanishing of
things, as stated in 54\].

‘*Sleeps happy and contented*,’—Happiness forms the very nature of the
Supreme Brahman; hence it is not meant that He is happy during sleep and
unhappy at other times;—of what nature his ‘*sleep*’ is has already been
explained;—as regards his ‘*contentment*,’ that is everlasting;
consisting of pure bliss, this Supreme Soul is never affected by the
waves of agitation that are set up in Nescience. Though (even with all
this) it is possible for him to be the *Creator* of all things. In the
ordinary world, a man retires from his household duties after having
done that he had to do,—with the feeling, ‘I have earned all the wealth
that was necessary for my family; I am free from troubles,’—and thus
sleeps in happiness and contentment, without fearing any trouble to
himself. To such a person is the Supreme Soul compared; this whole world
being in the position of ‘family’ to him;—this being intended as his
praise.

Or \[in order to avoid the necessity of having to reverse the order of
the words\] the verse may be taken as referring to Primordial Matter:
When Primordial Matter sleeps, then all things become absorbed into it
all at once; that is, they become resolved into the form of Primordial
Matter, being reduced to the position of their cause; that is, they are
reduced to a ‘condition in which they cease to undergo
modifications.’—‘*All at once*,’ all things contained in the womb of the
three regions.—The ‘*sleep*’ of Primordial Matter, which is devoid of
consciousness, can mean only *cessation of evolution*, and not
*inhibition of consciousness*;—‘*happiness*’ also is only figurative,
for the same reason that Matter is devoid of consciousness.—(54)

Govindarāja and Kullūka make this out to be the description of the
*Mahā-pralaya*, and the preceding verse of. the
Intermediate—*Khaṇḍa*—*pralaya*.

*Sarvabhūtātmā*—stands for the Sāṅkhya ‘*Pradhāna*’;—according to the
second explanation put forward by Medhātithi;—according to the other
explanation, accepted by Govindarāja and Kullūka, the term stands for
the Supreme Self of the Vedānta.
