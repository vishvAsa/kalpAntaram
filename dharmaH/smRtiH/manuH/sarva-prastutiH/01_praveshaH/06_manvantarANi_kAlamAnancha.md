When the Teacher (Manu) was asked (in the beginning of this work) to
explain Duties, he proceeded to describe the origination of the world
and other cognate matters; hence when the pupil (Bhṛgu) has been
directed to expound the Law, he also begins with the remaining parts of
the same process of world-creation.

‘*Of this*’—the pronoun refers to the Manu before their eyes;—our
teacher, who is known as ‘*Svāyambhuva*.’ There are *six other Manus who
belong to the same race* as himself,—persons horn in the same family are
said to ‘belong to the same race,’ and since all Manus are called into
being directly by Brahmā himself, they are born in the same family, and
are hence said to ‘belong to the same race.’ Or, persons engaged in the
same work are also said ‘to belong to the same race’; as a matter of
fact, living beings are often distributed among ‘races’ in accordance
with the work done by them; *e.g*., we have such statements as—‘related
to grammar there are two sages who belong to the same race.’

The text proceeds to point out one such work common to the Manus:—“*They
have called into being each his own offsprings*”; in each *Manvantara*,
created beings destroyed during the previous *Manvantara* are again
created and protected by that particular Manu who holds sway over that
*Manvantara*; hence the offsprings that each of them creates are called
‘his own.’—(61)

Here *seven Manus* have been mentioned by me; elsewhere they are spoken
of as *fourteen*.

‘*Each* *during his own regime*’—during his time, *i.e*., during the
time of his sovereignty.—‘*Having called into being*’ the offerings,
they ‘*maintained*,’ nourished, them.—‘*During his own regime*’—means
during the time of his sovereignty; *i.e*., that Manu whose time or turn
it was to create and maintain the continuity of the world.

Others explain the term ‘*antara*’ as denoting a particular time-period,
just like the words ‘month’ &c.

But this is not right; it is only when the term ‘*antara*’ occurs along
with the term ‘Manu’ (*i.e*., in the compound ‘*Manvantara*’) that it
becomes expressive of a time-period,—*i.e*., the time-period known ns
‘*Manvantara*,’—and not when it stands by itself (as it does in the

The author now begins to describe the measures of time, which are taught
in the Science of Astronomy, for the purpose of determining the exact
duration of time of the continuance of the world and its dissolution.

Eighteen ‘*nimeṣas*’ go to make that measure of time which is known as
‘*Kāṣṭhā*’;—thirty ‘*Kāṣṭhās*’ make one ‘*Kalā*’;—thirty ‘*Kalās*’ make
one ‘*Muhūrta*,’ and ‘*as many*’—*i.e*., thirty;—thirty ‘*muhurtas*’
make one ‘*Ahorātra*’ (Day and Night).

‘*Should be known as*’—this verb has got to be supplied.

‘*Tāvataḥ*,’ ‘a s many,’ is the Accusative Plural form.

“What is it that is called *Nimeṣa*?”

‘*Nimeṣa* is the natural *winking* of the Eye-lashes, which accompanies
every opening of the eye. Other people have declared that ‘*Nimeṣa*’ is
that time which is taken in the distinct utterance of one
letter-sound.—(64)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Nimeṣa*’—(1) The time taken by one wink of the eye, or (2) the time
taken in the distinct pronouncing of one syllable.

‘*Tāvaṭaḥ*’—in the Accusative necessitates the supplying of the
Transitive verb ‘*vidyāṭ*,’ ‘one should know’. Nārāyaṇa and Nandana
however favour the nominative form ‘*ṭāvanṭaḥ*’ which obviates the
necessity of adding any words.

*Cf*. in this connection Wilson’s Viṣṇu-Purāṇa—Ed. Hall, Vol. I, pp.
47-50.

‘*Ahorātra*’— ‘day’ and ‘night’; of these the Sun makes the division;
the Sun having risen, so long as his rays are visible, it is called
‘day’; and from the time that the Sun sets to the time that he rises
again, it is called ‘night.’ Such is the case in the region of men and
in the region of Gods.

“In a place where the Sun does not reach with his rays,—how is one to
make this division of ‘day’ and ‘night’?”

The answer to this is given in the second line—‘*what is conducive* &c.’
For such beings as are self-illumined, as the light is always there (and
it never ceases) the division of ‘day’ and ‘night’ is made according to
the *undertaking of actions* and *going to sleep*. Just as in the case
of herbs, the time for sprouting is fixed by nature, exactly in the same
manner, in the case of the beings in question, the times of ‘activity’
and ‘repose’ are fixed by the nature, of time itself \[and are not
variable\].—(65)

That which is the ‘month’ of men is a ‘day and night’ of the ‘*Pitṛs*.’
As regards ‘division’ as to which part is ‘day’ and which ‘night,’—this
division, that ‘this is *day* and that is *night*,’ is determined ‘*by
fortnights,’ i.e*., the *fifteen days*, which are known by the name of
‘half-month.’ That is, the said division is based upon fortnights: one
fortnight is ‘day,’ and another fortnight is ‘night.’ In view of the
fact that ‘day’ and ‘night’ differ in their character and occur in a
fixed order of sequence, the author adds the following distinction:—The
darker fortnight is ‘day,’ and the brighter fortnight, ‘night.’

The right reading (in view of the meaning intended) would be
‘*Karmaceṣṭābhyaḥ*’ (the Dative form), just as we have ‘*svapnāya*’; for
the meaning meant to be conveyed is that the day is *for the purpose* of
‘activity.’ Hence the Locative ending in the text can be explained only
as used on account of the exigencies of metre.—(66)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The ‘day’ and ‘night’ of Pitṛs is regulated by the Moon, just as those
of gods and men is by the Sun.

This verse has been quoted in the *Kālaviveka* (p. 112) in support of
the view that the seasons and other calculations are not governed by the
‘Lunar Month,’—which only serves the purpose of being the ‘Day-Night’ of
Pitṛs; the darker fortnight being their ‘day,’ and the brighter
fortnight ‘night’.

The same work quotes it again on p. 308, in support of the view that
‘from *Pratipat* to *Amāvāsyā* is the dark fortnight, and from
*Pratipat* to *Purṇamāsi* is the Bright Fortnight.’

during these six months the Sun abandons the Northern quarters and rises

‘*Brahmā*,’—The creator of living beings, has a region of his own; and
what is going to be described is *of* *Day* *and Night* as obtaining in
that region;—‘*as also of the Time-cycles*.’—‘*Learn*’ all this, ‘*in*
*brief*,’ summarily; *i.e*., hear it from me.—‘*one by one*’—that is, of
each time-cycle separately.

The present verse serves as the summary of what is going to be
described, intended to draw the attention of the audience; it is with
this view that they are exhorted to ‘*learn*.’—The ‘division of time’
having been already mentioned as the subject-matter of the context, the
reiterated promise (implied in the exhortation to ‘learn’) is meant to
indicate that a fresh subject is going to be introduced; the idea being
that what is going to be described now is not merely what remains of the
afore-mentioned ‘division of time,’ but it is also conducive to *merit*;
as will be directly stated in verse 73, where it is stated that
‘Brahma’s day is known to be sacred’; which means that the knowledge of
it brings merit.—(68)

The ‘*years*’ here spoken of are taken as the years *of the Gods*; as it
is this that has been mentioned last. Says the Author of the Purāṇas—‘O
Brāhmaṇas, all this has been described by the divine measure: the
measure of the Time-Cycles has been described by the divine
measure.’—‘*Four thousand*’ such ‘*years*’ of the Gods constitute the
Time-Cycle known as ‘*Kṛta*’:—of the ‘*Kṛta*’ cycle, ‘*as many*’,
*i*.*e*. four ‘*hundred*’ ‘years’ form the ‘*Juncture*’; and of the same
‘*Kṛta*’ Cycle, the ‘*Juncture-end*’ is consisting of a period of four
hundred years. That period of time which partakes in equal degree of the
character of the preceding as well as that of the succeeding Cycle, is
called ‘*Juncture*’; and ‘*Juncture-end*’ is that period of time which
also partakes of the character of both, but in a less degree, of the
preceding and, to a greater degree, of the succeeding Cycle.

The text contains the word ‘*tāvacchatī*’; and it is necessary to And
out the rule under which the final I has been lengthened. The only
grammatical explanation of the word possible is that it should be
expounded as ‘*tāvat śatānām sa* *māhārah*’, ‘the collection of as many
hundreds’; the term ‘*tāvat*’, ending in the ‘*vatu*’ affix, becomes a
numeral according to Pāṇini’s Sūtra 1.1.23, by which words ending in
‘*vatu*’ are regarded as ‘numerals’; so that the said compound having a
numeral for its first number becomes a ‘Dvigu’, according to Pāṇini
2.1.25; and since the Feminine affix *ṭāp* is precluded from *Dvigu*
compounds, we have the Feminine affix *ṅīp*; and the word ‘*tāvat*’
means ‘one whose measure is *tat* (that)’: it being derived from the
pronoun ‘*tat*’ with the ‘*vatup*’ affix, added according to Pāṇini’s
Sūtra 5.2.39; the vowel in ‘*tat*’ being lengthened by the *sūtra*
6.3.91. If the form ‘*tāvātī*’ were explained in any other way,—for
instance, if it were taken as a *Bahubrīhi* compound, being expounded as
‘*tāvanti śatāni yasyāḥ*’,—then, since the word ‘*śata*’ ends in ‘*a*’,
it would take the Feminine affix ‘*ṭāp*’ according to Pāṇini 4.1.1; so
that the form would be ‘*tāvaccatā*.’ This is the meaning.—(69)

‘*Sandhyā*’—it is not clear whether the *succeeding* or *preceding*
twilight is meant. Kullūka, and possibly Medhātithi, accepts the former
view.

*Medhātithi* (p. 34, l. 24) for ‘*Svabhāvānuvṛttiḥ*’; how would it do to
read ‘*Svabhāvānanuvṛttiḥ*’—the meaning being that the preceding
Twilight has the character of neither Day nor Night?

Among the three Time-cycles other then the *Kṛta*,—*i.e*. in *Tretā* and
the rest,—along with their ‘junctures’ and ‘juncture-ends’,—the
‘thousands’ are reduced (in each) by one; ‘reduction’ means dimunition.
That is in *Tretā*, the number of ‘thousand,’ is one less than that in
*Kṛta*; similarly the number in *Dvāpara* is one less than that in
*Tretā*; and that in *Kali* is one less than that in Thus *Tretā*
consists of three thousand years, *Dvāpara* of two thousand years, and
*Kali* of one thousand years. Similarly the number of ‘hundred’ goes on
diminishing in the ‘junctures’ and ‘juncture-ends’ of the Cycles.

‘*Yadetat*’ (in the sense of ‘this’) is an ordinary expression; and as a
whole it means *that which has been spoken of*.—‘*This period of four
Time-cycles that has been* *computed*’—*i.e*., the exact number of years
in which have been definitely determined before this verse,—e.g. in
verse 69, where the number of years in the Time-cycles is declared to be
*four thousand* etc., etc.,—‘*Twelve thousand*’ of this period of four
Time-cycles are called the ‘*Time-cycle of the Gods*’. That is to say
the *Divine Cycle* consists of twelve thousand ‘Four-Cycles.’

The word ‘*Sāhasram*’ is derived from the word ‘*sahasra*’ with the
reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*’; and the compound ‘*dvādaśasāhasram*’ is to be
expounded as ‘*dvādaśa-sahasrāṇi parimāṇe yasmin*’, ‘that in which the
measure is that of twelve-thousands’.—(71)

Burnell remarks—“According to the commentators the translation should
run thus: ‘The four Yugas just reckoned (consisting of) twelve thousand
years are called a *Yuga* of the gods.” This is the translation adopted
by Buhler also. What is not quite accurate is the statement that such a
translation is “according to the commentators”,—when we find that
according to Medhātithi at least, the meaning of the verse is as it is
represented by Burnell in his text. Medhātithi says
explicitly—‘*dvādaśa-chaturyuga—sahasrāṇi devayugam nāma kāla
ityarthaḥ*’.

In face of the fact that the words of the text themselves convey this
meaning—which involves the ‘lengthening’ of the ordinary into divine
years,—it is difficult to understand Burnell’s remark that this
‘lengthening’ ‘is the work of commentators.’ On the contrary, on
Burnell’s own showing, the ‘commentators’ would appear to have
*shortened* the great length of the divine year clearly expressed by the
words of the text.
