<p>In course of the enunciation of the ‘heads of dispute’, after ‘adultery’
comes ‘the determining of the duties of husband and wife’, it is this
therefore that is now going to be set forth.</p>
<p>When the husband is very much harassed by his wife, or the wife is very
much persecuted by her husband, the dispute is to be brought up before
the king.</p>
<p>It has been laid down that the wife shall attend upon her husband who
behaves in the right manner, who is not beset with hate and jealousy and
who is well-disposed towards his wife; and the husband has no sort of
‘sovereignty’ over his wife; and the (attending) is to consist in
shampooing his feet and rendering such service as behoves a servant</p>
<p>Though the words used in the text are ‘man’ and ‘woman—which only denote
the human genus in its two sexes,—yet in the present context they are
relative terms, connotative of the <em>husband</em> and <em>wife</em>; specially as in
the next verse, the term ‘<em>sva</em>’ (<em>svaiḥ</em>) clearly indicates that the
‘man’ and ‘woman’ bear a distinct relationship to one another.</p>
<p>The present verse contains the author’s declaration as to what he is
going to do in the coming discourse.</p>
<p>Of the husband and wife ,—‘<em>during union</em>’—while they are together,—and
‘<em>during separation</em>’,—when the husband has gone away from home.</p>
<p>‘<em>The righteous path</em>’— regarding toilet, the care of the body and so
forth.</p>
<p>All this ‘<em>I am going to expound</em>’.</p>
<p>The epithet ‘<em>eternal</em>’ is only by way of praise.</p>
<p>‘<em>Who keep to the righteous path</em>—this is purely reiterative of the fact
that it is the path laid down in the legal scriptures that is the most
righteous.—(1).</p>

<p>Women should not be left free to act as they like, in regard to
morality, wealth and pleasure. Whenever they desire to employ their
wealth in acts of righteousness and the like, they should obtain the

according to her age.</p>

having recourse to—these,—‘<em>they should be kept under one’s
control</em>,’—should be cheeked.</p>
<p>Though the phrase ‘<em>not left to themselves</em>’ indicates the propriety of
depriving them of independence in regard to all actions, yet the text
specifically mentions the ‘sensual objects’ with a view to point out
that in regard to latter special care should be taken; so that people
may not be led to think that all that is necessary is to prevent the
women from associating with other men, and it does not matter if they
become addicted to drink and other evils, while keeping confined to
their homes.</p>
<p>The particle ‘<em>ca</em>’ indicates that, though what the words directly
declare is the duty of the man, yet it also follows that the woman also
should not be independent; it is in this manner that the duties of both
‘man and woman’ in relation to one another become expounded, as promised
in verse (1),—and not those duties that consist of sacrificial
performances and the like.—(2).</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.195), which adds the following
notes:—As a matter of fact, this appearing of husband and wife before
the king as plaintiff and defendant is forbidden, and as such there is
no room for this subject under the present head; but what is meant is
that if, from other sources, the king should happen to hear of the
misbehaviour of the one or the other of the party, he should interfere,
and by means of judicious punishment bring them back to the path of
righteousness; otherwise he becomes involved in sin.—<em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> has
the following explanatory notes:—‘<em>Svaiḥ</em>’, the women’s own brother and
other relations,—‘<em>divāniśam</em>,’ always,—‘<em>viṣayesu</em>’, even such objects
of enjoyment as are not actually forbidden, such as beautiful things,
tasty food, and so forth,—‘<em>sajjantyaḥ</em>’ addicted,—they should be kept
under control.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 322); in
<em>Smṛtisāroddhāra</em> (p. 330), which adds that ‘though a regular law-suit
between husband and wife has been prohibited, yet if the king happens to
learn from other sources, of quarrels between them, he should intervene
and make them keep to the right path,’—in <em>Kṛtyasārasamuccaya</em> (p. 98)
which explains ‘<em>sajjantyaḥ</em>’ as becoming ‘addicted’—and in
<em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, 31b).</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>‘<em>Guarding</em>’ here stands for <em>averting of trouble</em>,—‘trouble’ consisting
in suffering caused by the transgression of the right course of conduct,
by illegal appropriation of property and so forth; and the ‘averting’ of
this consists in warding it off. This should be done by the father and
others.</p>
<p>The Present tense in ‘<em>guards</em>’ has the force of the Injunctive; such
use being a Vedic idiom; hence the word ‘<em>guards</em>’ should be taken to
mean ‘should guard’.</p>
<p>The mention of the three stages of her life separately is only meant to
show on whom lies the greater responsibility during a certain period of
the woman’s life. In reality all the male relatives are equally
responsible for her safety.</p>
<p>‘<em>Virginity</em>’—stands for the period preceding her being given away in
marriage.</p>
<p>Smilarly ‘<em>youth</em>’ stands for the period during which her husband is
alive.</p>
<p>Thus the words of the text are only reiterative of the actual state of
things; the sense being that the woman shall be guarded by that man
under whose tutilage she may he living at the time. It is for this
reason that even during her husband’s life-time, the responsibility for
the woman’s protection rests upon her father and her son also. This is
what has been declared in the laws of Manu; which means that all of them
shall guard her at all times; and this has not been stated in so many
words, as that would have made the text prolix.</p>
<p>“What is asserted here has been already declared above, under 5. 147.”</p>
<p>Not so; ‘independence’ is one thing and ‘guarding’ is another. 5.147 has
declared that woman shall not be ‘independent’, while the present text
lays down that she shall be ‘guarded’, as a matter of fact even while
the woman is ‘dependent’ upon some one else, she may be open to danger,
which has got to be averted.</p>
<p>“But in the present text also it is said that ‘the woman is not fit for
<em>independence</em>.”</p>
<p>Our answer to this is that the present text does not lay down that she
shall not be independent in regard to anything at all; all that it means
is that her mind being not quite under her control, she is not capable
of guarding herself, specially as she does not possess the requisite
strength. Under discourse V on the other hand, the absence of
‘independence’ laid down is in regard to something totally different
(<em>i.e</em>. her property).—(3).</p>

widow is without a son, the members of her husband’s family shall be her

If the husband&rsquo;s family has perished, and not a single member of it is
left, her father’s family shall be her master. When there is no one left
in either of the two families, the King becomes her lord and protector;
it is for him to protect her and punish her if she deviates from the
right path.’</p>

daughter within three years of her puberty doubtlessly contracts a guilt
equal to that of killing an embryo. He who does not approach, during
three years, a wife who is marriageable, incurs, without doubt, a guilt
equal to that of killing an embryo; but if a man does not approach his
wife after she has bathed after her temporary uncleanliness, though he
dwells near her,—his ancestors lie, during that month, in the menstrual
excretions of the wife. They declare that the guilt of the husband who
does not approach his wife in due season,—of him who approaches her

crime, is equally heinous.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.69-70).—‘They quote the following:—“If through the
father’s negligence, a maiden is given away after the suitable age has
passed, she, who was waiting for a husband, destroys him who gives her

marry his daughter while she still goes about naked; for if she stays in
the house after the age of puberty, sin falls upon the father.”’</p>

guilt of killing an embryo, at each of her menstrual periods.’</p>
<p><em>Kāśyapa</em> (Aparārka, p. 93).—‘If a girl perceives her menstrual blood
while she is still in her father’s house, unmarried, her father becomes

<p>The wife has to be protected, not only because the scriptures prescribe
it as a duty; but also because it serves many useful purposes, such as
the following.</p>
<p>‘<em>Offspring</em>’—Progeny, in the shape of sons and daughters. The
‘preservation’ of this means that one’s progeny is kept pure, free from
the amalgam of castes. ‘<em>Character</em>’—cultured habits.</p>
<p>‘<em>Family</em>’—described above. If a single woman of a family loses her
chastity, the ill-fame attaches to the whole family, the idea among the
people being that ‘the women of such and such a family are not chaste’.</p>
<p>Or, the meaning may be that the said guarding is necessary in view of
the fact that, if the purity of the progeny were not secured, there
would be no proper fulfilment of the after-death rites performed in
honour of one’s ancestors.</p>
<p>‘<em>His own self</em>’.—It is well known that men are often murdered by their
wife’s paramours, or poisoned by their wives.</p>
<p>‘<em>His religion</em>’—An unchaste woman not being entitled to being
associated in the performance of religious rites.</p>
<p>For these reasons, if a man guards his wife, he preserves all these—(7).</p>

dishonoured by ladies of the family misbehaving’ (Medhātithi,
alternatively, and Rāghavā nanda);—‘position of the family’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘property’ (Rāghavānanda).</p>
<p>‘<em>Ātmānam</em>’—‘Himself,’ ‘as only legitimate children can offer
<em>Śrāddhas</em>’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘because an
adultress and her paramour may attempt his life’ (Medhātithi).</p>
<p>‘<em>Dharmam</em>’—‘Tending of the sacred fires, to which the husband of an

<p>This is a purely declamatory passage. As a matter of fact, the husband
is never found to enter the womb of his wife; and it is the entrance of
the semen, the very essence of his body, into the wife’s womb, which is
figuratively called his own ‘<em>entering</em>’. The Mantra also says—‘You are
my own self, called by the name of <em>son</em>’.</p>
<p>The real basis of the denotation of the term ‘wife’, ‘<em>jāyā</em>’, is that
the husband <em>is re-born of her</em>.</p>
<p>The application of the name^(‘)<em>jāyā</em>’, ‘wife’ being based upon the fact
of the woman giving birth to the child, she comes to be spoken of as the
‘wife’ of her paramour also.—(8).</p>

<p>The present text proceeds to explain what has been said in verse 7.</p>
<p>One should not entertain the idea that what is meant is—either (1) that
‘the woman brings forth a child of <em>the same caste</em> as that of the other
man to whom she clings’, or (2) that ‘the child born resembles that man
in his qualities’; because the child born of a <em>Śūdra</em> is a <em>caṇḍāla</em>’
and so forth. Even in the case of the parties belonging to the same
caste, the caste of the child is not the same as that of the father;
since it has been declared that ‘the child should be born of a woman of
untouched womb’. If again, the child were to resemble the father in
qualities, it would mean that the text permits the woman whose husband
is poor and of bad character to have recourse to another man possessed
of better qualities.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the text is taken as purely declamatory, the
sense of the assertion, ‘as the man so the child’ comes to be that ‘the
child born is not endowed with the qualities of the family’.—(9).</p>

<p><em>Śukranīti</em> (3.30-5.3).—‘Living with other men, speaking with them even
in public and freedom even for a moment, should not be granted to women,
by their husband, father, King, son, father-in-law and other relatives;
nor time for anything besides domestic duties.’</p>
<p>Do. (4.4.40-42).—‘The good wife should give up words that indicate
senselessness, lunacy, anger, or envy; also the contemptible vices of
meanness, jealousy, excessive attachment to worldly things, vanity and
boastfulness, ungodliness, adventurousness and thieving.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (24.5, 7).—‘Let not a woman reside in another man’s house
separated from her father, husband or sons; by giving way to malicious
propensities, she is sure to lose her reputation. Drinking wine, roaming
about, sleeping during the day, and neglect of daily duties are the
faults disgracing a woman.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (25.3, 9, 10-12).—‘To show reverence to her mother-in-law,
father-in-law, elders, divinities and to guests; not to decorate herself
with ornaments while her husband is absent from home; not to resort to
the houses of others; not to stand at the door or at windows; not to act
by herself in any matter.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha</em> (Aparārka, p. 108).—‘Without permission, she should not go out
of the house; nor without an upper garment; she should not walk very
fast; nor converse with men, except with traders, renunciates, the aged
and physicians; she should not expose her navel; she should wear clothes
hanging down to the ankles; should never uncover her breasts; should
never laugh without covering her face; should never bear ill-will
towards her husband or his relations; should never sit with a prostitute
or other such bad women; as one’s character becomes besmirched by
associating with bad characters.’</p>
<p><em>Vyāsa</em> (Do., p. 108).—‘Sitting at the door, peeping out of the window,
improper conversation and laughing go to disgrace women of noble
families.’</p>
<p><em>Hārīta</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 432).—‘She should avoid looking at and
conversing with other men and associating with wicked ascetics and
others; should never go to the house of strangers, to the public road or
road-crossings or lanes, or to the abode of ascetics; should avoid
standing on the path to the wells and roaming in the morning and in the
evening; she should never think of using the bed, seat, clothes and
ornaments belonging to others, until they have been cleansed and
repaired, etc., etc., etc.’</p>

<p>Some people entertain the following notion;—“Even though woman may
misbehave, she may, with the help of Vedic texts, perform some rites in
the shape of secret Expiatory Rites and thus become pure; so that there
cannot be much harm in her misbehaving”</p>
<p>But this is not true; because ‘<em>for women there is no dealing with
sacred texts</em>’; so that there can be no repeating of the texts; which,
with the help of her own learning, she might do whenever she
transgressed and thereby regain her purity. For this reason also they
should be carefully guarded;—this is the injunction to which the
statement in the present verse is a declamatory supplement.</p>
<p>Some people have held that the present verse contains the absolute
prohibition of the use of sacred texts in connection with all kinds of
rites for women; and holding this opinion, they declare that whatever
rites may be performed, by whomsoever, for the sake of women,—that is,
(a) in rites where women figure as the performers, as in the making of
offerings, or (b) in those where they figure as the object to be
sanctified, as in the tonsure-ceremony, or (c) in those where they
figure as recipients, us in <em>śrāddhas</em> offered to them,—at all these the
use of sacred texts being forbidden by the present text, no such texts
should be used at the <em>śrāddhas</em> offered to women.</p>
<p>But these people say what is not reasonable; because the present text
refers to a totally different matter, and is a purely hortatory
supplement. And it still remains to be explained what there is in the
text to indicate either injunction or prohibition regarding such rites
as the Tonsure and the like. As for the inability of women to recite the
expiatory texts, this follows from the fact of their not learning the
Vedas.</p>
<p>‘<em>Destitute of Organs</em>’—‘<em>Organ</em>’ here stands for <em>strength</em>;—courage,
patience, intelligence, energy and so forth are absent in women; that is
why they are prone to become over-powered by sinful propensities. Hence
it is that they have to be carefully guarded.</p>
<p>‘<em>Women are false</em>’;—on account of the inconstancy of their character
and affections, they are deprecated as being ‘false’—(18)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The author now puts forward, in support of the assertion that ‘by their
nature women are impure in their hearts’, Vedic texts and declamatory
passages.</p>
<p>[The author says]—I have declared that ‘women are false’; and this
same fact is assorted in the texts of the Vedas also.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>nigama</em>’ is synonymous with ‘<em>veda</em>’, and is found to be used
as such. The term ‘<em>nigama</em>’ is also found to be used as a name for that
subsidiary science which explains the meaning of vedic texts,—<em>i.e</em>. in
such statements as ‘<em>Nigama Nirukta</em> and <em>Vyākaraṇa</em> are the subsidiary
sciences.’ In the <em>Nirukta</em> also in found the expression—‘These are
<em>nigamas</em>’; and the term ‘<em>nigama</em>’ here cannot be taken as standing for
anything else but ‘Vedic texts’, as is dear from the examples cited.
Thus it is only right that in the present text the term ‘<em>nigama</em>’
should be taken as standing for the <em>Veda</em>.</p>
<p>The texts are spoken of as ‘<em>in the Veda</em>’, which presupposes the
relation of constainer and contained, on the understanding that there is
some sort of difference between the whole and its parts.</p>
<p>In the <em>Nigama</em>, Veda, there are ‘<em>texts</em>’, sentences, forming part of
it, which are ‘<em>sung</em>’— recited, repeated, read there. In fact no
limitation of time (part, present or future) is applicable to the case
of the Veda, which is <em>ever present</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Nigadāḥ</em>’ is another reading for ‘<em>nigītā</em>’. In this case ‘<em>nigada</em>’
would mean <em>the mantra-texts</em>; and the term ‘<em>śruti</em>’ would mean the
<em>Brāhmaṇa texts</em>’, and the meaning would be that ‘this fact <em>that women
are false</em> is stated in both <em>Mantra</em> and <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> texts.’</p>
<p>In this latter leading the construction would be—‘<em>bahvyaḥ santi</em>’,
‘there <em>are</em> many such texts’,—the verb ‘<em>santi</em>’, ‘are’, being added.</p>
<p>From among these texts listen to those that are meant to be ‘expiatory’
of the sin of unchastity.</p>
<p>“Why are the said texts put forth?”</p>
<p>‘<em>For the purpose of indicating the true character of women</em>.’ <em>True
character</em> means the permanent feature of their nature, and the texts
are meant to expose this.</p>
<p>‘<em>Character</em>’ means <em>disposition</em>; and the disposition meant here is
<em>proneness to unchastity</em>.—(19)</p>

<p>The particle ‘<em>iti</em>’ at the end of the third quarter of the verse
indicates that up to that point we have the part of an original Vedic
text.</p>
<p>‘<em>If my mother, unfaithful unto her lord</em>’,—she who observes the vow
‘may I never, even in my mind, conceive love for any man other than my
husband’ is called ‘<em>faithful unto her lord</em>’; the opposite of that is
‘<em>unfaithful unto her lord</em>’:—‘<em>roaming about</em>’— in the houses of other
people,—seeing a gaily dressd (dressed?) person—‘<em>became
enamoured</em>’—conceived a desire for that other man;—‘<em>that</em>’— impurity or
evil in my birth, ‘<em>may the semen of my fatter remove</em>’; <em>i.e</em>., may
that impurity be washed off by that semen. The nominative ending in
‘<em>pitā</em>’ has the force of the genetive. Or the <em>semen</em> itself may be
taken in apposition to the ‘father’; which it can be without having its
gender altered, just as we have in other phrases: ‘<em>dyaurme pita</em>’, ‘the
heaven, my father’ (<em>where</em> ‘<em>dyauḥ</em>’ in the feminine, is in apposition
to ‘father’).</p>
<p>Or ‘<em>semen</em>’ may be taken as standing for the <em>mother’s</em> seed; and in
that case the meaning would be—‘may my father purify that seed of my
mother’; <em>i.e</em>., may the impurity of the mother’s seed be removed by the
force of the father’s seed.</p>
<p>‘<em>This is an example</em>’— instance—‘<em>of this</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., of the proneness of
women to unchastity.</p>
<p>All men when reciting sacred texts recite the one here quoted; and the
reciting of such a text by all men would be justified only if all women
were prone to unchastity; otherwise, if only some were so, the use of
the text would not be universal.</p>
<p>The text here quoted has been prescribed as to be recited during the
‘<em>Cāturmāsya</em>’ sacrifice, as also at <em>śrāddhas</em>, during the
‘<em>Padyānumantraṇa</em>’ rite.—(20)</p>

rescension of the <em>Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda</em>. According to the former, it has to
be recited by the ‘son of a paramour.’ But the <em>Kaṭhas</em> prescribe its
use by every sacrificer who offers a <em>Cāturmāsya</em> sacrifice.”—Buhler.</p>

the form contact with other men—‘<em>she</em>’—the woman—‘<em>thinks of</em>;’—of that
mental transgression, the ‘<em>expiation</em>’— purification—is expressed by
the aforesaid <em>text</em>, if used in the right manner at the proper rite.</p>
<p>By the way the author has indicated the use of the particular text. Even

transgression.—(21)</p>

<p>If a man wishes to guard his wife, he should guard himself also against
evil habits; and it is not the woman that should preserve her chastity.
Since if the man has a bad character, his wife also becomes the same;
just as the wife of a man possessed of good character becomes good. For
instance the river, though herself sweet-watered, becomes saline like
the Ocean, when she joins this latter.—(22)</p>

<p><em>Question</em>.—“In what way is the duty towards children conducive to
happiness, since children are dependent upon the man himself, and women,
being beset with many defects, deserve to be abandoned? And who is there
who would be willing to maintain all these in his house?”</p>
<p>It is with a view to set aside such notions that we have the present
verse.</p>
<p>In as much as the defects of women are capable of rectification, they
are ‘<em>worthy of worship</em>’. When the above-mentioned verses dilated upon
the defects of women, it was not with a view to discredit them, or to
make people avoid them; it was done with this view that they may be
guarded against evil. Simply because there are beggars, people do not
give up cooking their food; or because there are deer to graze them,
people do not desist from sowing seeds.</p>
<p>‘<em>Bearing children</em>’—stands for the whole series of acts beginning with
conception and ending with fostering and bringing them up: as is going
to be said below (27)—‘Begetting of children and nourishing of those
that are born’.</p>
<p>They are like effulgence in their home. It is well-known that there is
no comfort at home, in the absence of the wife. Even when there is
plenty of wealth, if the wife is absent, the household is not able to
attend to the feeding and other needs of friends and relatives that may
happen to come in as guests. In fact, they are as powerless as poor men.</p>
<p>For this reason there is no difference between the Goddess of Fortune
and women in their homes.—(26)</p>

<p>‘<em>Disquisitions</em>’—the setting forth of a matter for investigation; or a

<p>‘<em>Propitious</em>’—beneficial.</p>
<p>The subject of the ‘laws relating to children,’ which was introduced in
verse 25 has been interrupted by the few verses dealing with the
greatness of women; hence it has been necessary to recall attention to
the original subject-matter—‘<em>listen to the disquisition</em>’.—(31)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>
<p><strong>(verses 9.31-44)</strong></p>
<p>(See also under 48-56.)</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (18.9-14).—‘The child belongs to one who begets it except when
an agreement to the contrary has been made. The child begotten on his
wife at a living husband’s request belongs to the husband; but if
begotten by a stranger, it belongs to the latter;—or to both;—but if
reared by the husband, it belongs to him.’</p>
<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (2.13.6-7).—‘A Brāhmaṇa-text says that the son belongs to
the begetter. They quote also the following verse from the Veda:—“Having
considered myself formerly as a father, I shall not now allow any longer
my wives to be approached by other men, since they have declared that a
son belongs to the begetter in the world of Yama. The giver of the seed
carries off the son after death, in Yama’s world. Therefore they guard
their wives, fearing the seed of strangers. Carefully watch over the
procreation of your children, lest stranger-seed he sown on your soil.
In the next world, the son belongs to the begetter; an imprudent husband
makes the begetting of children futile for himself.”’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.6-9).—‘There is a difference of opinion. Some say the son
belongs to the husband of the mother, and others say he belongs to the
begetter. With respect to this they quote verses on both sides, like the
following:—“If one man’s bull were to beget a hundred calves on another
man’s cows, they would belong to the owner of the cows; in vain would
the bull have spent his strength.” “Carefully watch the procreation of
your offspring, lest strangers sow seed on your soil; in the next world,
the son belongs to the begetter; by carelessness, a husband makes his
offspring futile for himself.”’</p>
<p>Do. (17.63-64).—‘They declare that a son begotten on a widow who has not
been duly authorised, belongs to the begetter; if she was duly
authorised, then the child belongs to both the males connected with the
authorisation.’</p>
<p>See Manu 10.72.</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 414).—‘The origin or soil is the
most potent factor; that is why castes become intermixed.’</p>
<p>Do. (p. 581).—‘The declaration of the Veda is that the child belongs to
the owner of the soil; some sages say that the child belongs to the
mother; the child is said to belong to two fathers.’</p>

has been married, but only the begetter of the son in a soil belonging
to another man.</p>
<p>This diversity of opinion is next pointed out—‘<em>Some people declare the

declare ‘<em>the</em> <em>owner</em> <em>of the soil</em>’ to be so; <em>i.e</em>., the person whose
wife the woman is, even though he be not the actual begetter.</p>

<p>‘<em>The woman</em>’ is as if it were ‘<em>the soil</em>’. ‘<em>Soil</em>’ stands for that
part of the Earth where corns are grown; and the woman is like that:
Just as the seed sown and held in the soil sprouts up, so also the semen
deposited in the woman.</p>
<p>‘<em>The man is like the seed</em>’,—Here also the term ‘<em>bhūta</em>’ denotes
similitude. The man’s semen is the ‘<em>seed</em>’, and not the man himself;
but he is himself so called because the semen is contained in him.</p>
<p>‘<em>From the union</em>’— contact, the relationship of container and
contained—there is ‘<em>the production</em>’—birth—‘<em>of all corporeal
beings</em>’—beings endowed with bodies; <em>i.e</em>. of the four kinds of living
beings. In the case of sweat-born insects also, the <em>ākāśa</em> is the
‘soil’ and <em>sweat</em> the ‘seed’, and the ‘union’ of these is the relation
of container and contained.</p>
<p>For the said reason it is only right that there should be the said
doubt; as there can be no ‘production’ when either of the two is absent;
the function of both being necessary in the begetting of the child; and
since there is nothing to indicate to which one of the two the child
belongs, hence the doubt as to whether the child belongs to both or to
either one of the two.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole of this subject relating to the relationship of the
child and the person to whom the child belongs is one that is amenable
to reasoning; as we shall show under the verso where the details are set
forth.—(33)</p>

<p>The doubt having been set forth, the author puts forward the
‘preponderance of the seed’ as the <em>prima facie</em> argument And if the
seed is the superior factor, then the child must belong to him whose the
seed is. That the seed is the more important is indicated by the fact
that in the case of the corn and such other things, though the soil and
several other causes operate in their production, yet they take up the
characteristics of the seed. So that even though in the case of the
child, the transmission of the characteristics of the seed is not. so
clearly manifest, yet it has to be accepted as a fact, on the basis of
the fact of such transmission being found in the case of corn and other
things. Further, it is only when this view that is accepted that the
uniformity of all products becomes established. Thus it is that
superiority belongs to the seed.</p>
<p>This is what is shown by the text—‘<em>the production of all things</em>’ is
found to be ‘<em>marked by the characteristics of the seed</em>’;—<em>these</em>
‘<em>characteristics of the seed</em>’ consisting in shape, colour, figure and
so forth; and by this is the production ‘<em>marked</em>’ distinguished;
<em>i.e</em>., it follows them.—(35)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The foregoing verse has described the fact that the qualities of the
seed are reproduced in the product; the present verse is going to show
that the qualities of the soil are not so reproduced.</p>
<p>‘<em>This earth is called the womb</em>’—soil of production—‘<em>of
things</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., herb, vegetables, thickets, creepers and other
immovable things; and yet none of the qualities of the earth are found
in these things, neither clay nor dust bring found in them.</p>
<p>‘<em>The seed does not develop in its development</em>’.—The term ‘<em>seed</em>’ here
stands for the corn growing out of the sprouts, and not for the loots.
The corn, left over after consumption, when sown, again becomes the
seed; and this does not ‘<em>develop</em>’—reproduce;—the reproduction of
qualities being a part of the ‘development,’ we have the present tense
in ‘develops,’—acquires, obtains—‘<em>the qualities of the womb</em>’—in its
constituent parts, if the verb ‘develops’ itself had stood for the
<em>reproduction</em> that forms part of the development, then the term ‘in its
development’ would be superfluous. Hence, according to the principle
that verbal roots have several meanings, the verb ‘develops’ has to be
taken as denoting something else. Or, the term ‘<em>in its development</em>’
may be taken as only serving the purpose of filling up the metre; and
the superfluity thus explained somehow. Or the two terms, ‘<em>in its
development</em>’ and ‘<em>develops</em>’, may be explained as standing
respectively for the general and special forms; just as in the
expression ‘<em>svapoṣam</em> <em>puṣṭaḥ</em>’, ‘nourished by his own
nourishment.’—(87)</p>

<p>The <em>prima facie</em> argument having been put forward, the present verse
sets forth the established doctrine; and what the text means is that the
soil is the predominant factor.</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>—“In the text there is no word signifying the predominance of
the soil; all that is declared is the prohibition of having recourse to
other’s wives—‘<em>shall not sow in another’s wife</em>’; which means that one
should not let his semen enter another man’s wife; and it does not mean
that the child belongs to the person to whom the soil belongs.”</p>
<p>True; but when we take the present text along with what follows (under
43) regarding ‘the seed sown in what belongs to another’ being
‘lost’,—it becomes clear that the prohibition of intercourse contained
in the present verse is based upon the consideration that the child born
would be taken away by another, and it is not with a view to any
spiritual result The prohibition based upon spiritual considerations has
in fact already gone before (4.134); where it has been said that ‘there
is nothing so conducive to the shortening of life etc.’ Thus the
conclusion is that, (inasmuch as the present prohibitive text is
supplementary to another text (43), with which it has to be construed,
we are not free to interpret it as we choose; so that the only right
course is to take it as declaring the predominance of the soil.</p>
<p>‘<em>Intelligent</em>,’—possessed of inborn intelligence.</p>
<p>‘<em>Well-trained</em>’— thoroughly educated by his father and others.</p>
<p>‘<em>Conversant with the sciences and the arts</em>’.—The terms ‘<em>jñāna</em>’ and
‘<em>vijñāna</em>’ connote instrumentality (meaning <em>jñāyate anena iti
jñānam</em>’, and ‘<em>vijñāyate anena iti vijñānam</em>’). So that the term
‘<em>jñāna</em>’, ‘<em>science</em>’, stands for the sciences subsidiary to the Veda,
and ‘<em>vijñāna</em>’, ‘<em>arts</em>’, for the art of reasoning and the fine arts.</p>
<p>The sense of the verse is that the man who is possessed of any
intelligence should never do such an act; since such is the law laid
down in all scriptures. As regards the ignoramus, who is as good as an
animal, the present, teaching is not meant for him at all. Hence what is
stated here is purely reiterative.</p>
<p>‘<em>If he desires longevity</em>’.—This has been added with a view to indicate
that the present prohibition is the same as that contained under
Discourse IV; and this sets aside the idea as to its being a distinct
prohibition.—(41)</p>

<p>The term ‘<em>gāthā</em>’ is the name of a particular metre; as has been
declared by Piṅgala—‘<em>Atrāsiddhaṅgātheti</em> it is also used in the sense
of verses handed down by a long-continued tradition. For instance, in
the Veda, we find that, having made the declaration—‘This is the <em>gāthā</em>
of the learned that is going to be recited’, it goes on to quote the
verses ‘<em>Yadasya pūrvamaparanta-dasya</em> &amp;c.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Sung by Vāyu</em>’—recited, declared by him.</p>
<p>‘<em>Conversant with ancient lore</em>;’—those who know all about what happened
in the past cycles.</p>
<p>‘<em>In what belongs to another</em>’—In another man’s field.—(42)</p>

<p>The relation of husband and wife established by ancient tradition is
such that two totally distinct entities are spoken of as one. For
instance, though the Earth (<em>Pṛthivī</em>) was associated with King <em>Pṛthu</em>
thousands of years ago, yet she is even now named after him ‘<em>Pṛthivī</em>’.</p>
<p>In view of this, even though a son may be born of another man, he must
belong to him whose wife the mother is.</p>
<p>‘<em>They declare the field to belong to him who cleared off the
stalks</em>;’—there being no other relationship spoken of, the Genetive
ending (in ‘<em>sthāṇūcchedasya</em>’) must signify the relation of possessor
and possessed.</p>
<p>‘<em>Stalks</em>’— stands here for groves, thickets, creepers and other growths
on the land;—he who clears off these is ‘<em>he who clears off the
stalks</em>.’ The land belongs to him by whom the over-growths have been
cleared and the land levelled and made into arable land. The fruits of
filling and sowing this land also belong to that same man.</p>
<p>‘<em>The deer to belong to him who struck the dart</em>.’— ‘They declare’ has
to be construed with this also. Where several persons are hunting and
following a deer, they declare the animal to belong to him the dart of
whose arrow is found in its body. So that it belongs to the man who
wounded it first, and tills is what has been said above regarding ‘the
arrow of the shooter being wasted.’—(44)</p>

<p>Some one may have the following notion:—“Other men’s wives may be made
one’s <em>own</em> by paying money to the husband, and the difficulty regarding
ownership being thus removed, the son horn of her would belong to the
begetter.”</p>
<p>This is declared to be not possible. Wives of other men cannot be made
one s own even by the paying of a thousand gold-coins.</p>
<p>Nor, when she is abandoned by her husband on account of poverty, can the
wife belong to the man who receives her.</p>
<p>The reason for this lies in the fact that verse 3.4, which contains the
injunction of marriage, uses the verb ‘<em>udvaheta</em>’ (‘shall take’), in
the <em>Ātmanepada</em> form, which clearly indicates that the woman who has
been ‘taken’ through the sacramental rites by one man cannot he the
‘wife’ of any other man; just as the ‘<em>āhavanīya</em>’ (sacrificial Fire)
cannot he regarded as being so for any other person save the one who has
kindled it with the prescribed rites.</p>
<p>‘<em>Sale</em>’ stands for <em>purchase</em> as well as <em>exchange</em>; and
‘<em>Repudiation</em>’ for <em>abandoning</em>. By neither of them is the wife
‘<em>released</em>’— lose the character of ‘wife.’—(46)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>This has been explained by us under the [section on ‘Rescision’
(8.227)].</p>
<p>At the time of partition, if the co-partners are such as are entitled to
equal as well as unequal shares, they should divide the property in such
equal and unequal shares. This partition having been once made, some one
of the co-partners may subsequently raise objections to it. It is such
subsequent objection that the ‘present verse is meant to preclude. If,
however, at the very outset, the party were to indicate the inadequacy
of his share, then, the partition should have to be revised. If, on the
other hand, the objecter should declare the inequity of the partition
after the lapse of a long time, all that he can claim is the
equalisation of his own share, and not a rescission of the whole
partition; since during the time that has elapsed each co-partner will
have made additions to his share, or carried out repairs to what may
have been in a dilapidated condition, or used up the clothes and gold
and other things [so that a re-partition of the entire inheritance
would not be possible].</p>
<p>Others, however, explain the declaration regarding ‘the share falling
only once’ to mean that—‘if after the partition, it be discovered
subsequently that there are some among the co-partners who are affected
by impotence or some such physical defect as disqualifies him from
receiving a share in the property,—there shall be no resumption of these
shares by the others.’</p>
<p>Similarly, if there be some co-partners who are really entitled to two,
three or four shares, but somehow at the time of partition, all of them
receive equal shares, then, if, after sometime, they were to complain,
they should not be permitted to annul the former partition.</p>
<p>In the case of the outcast, however, there is resumption of his share,
as we shall explain later on.</p>
<p>‘<em>The maiden is given away only once</em>.’—Though this would imply that the
husband acquires ownership over the girl immediately after verbal
betrothal,—even before the marriage has been performed,—yet what is
really meant is that particular time which is indicated by such
declarations as ‘One might take away a girl even though she may have
been betrothed’ (<em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 1.65) and ‘The marriage is to be
regarded as accomplished at the seventh step’ (<em>Manu</em>, 8.227). This we
have already explained above.</p>
<p>“<em>Once does one say ‘I give</em>’”—Cows and other things are given away to
others in the same form of ownership that, the giver himself has over
them; but the maiden belongs to the father as ‘daughter,’ while she is
given away to the other party as his ‘wife’; so that the father’s
relationship to her does not cease. It is for this reason that she has
been mentioned separately (in the sentence ‘the maiden is given away
only once’).</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>.—“If the father’s ownership and relationship does not cease,
how can the ‘giving away of the maiden’ be said to be accomplished? It
is in the very nature of the act of <em>giving</em> that the ownership of one
ceases and that of another is brought about.”</p>
<p>There is no force in this objection. In the case in question there are
two relationships,—that of parent and child, and that of owner and
owned, and while the former remains intact, the latter does cease. This
is what is meant when verse 5.188 declares that ‘During childhood the
girl should remain under her father,’ and ‘under her husband during
youth,’ which indicates the cessation of the father’s ownership and the
coming into existence of that of the husband.—(27)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 490), which adds
that this rule regarding the betrothal of a girl pertains to cases where
the bridegroom to whom the girl has been betrothed has no disqualifying
defects;—in</p>
<p><em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 388), which adds that the
irrevocability of a partition here spoken of is meant for those cases
where all doubts regarding its fairness can be set at rest by reasonable
arguments;—in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (II, p. 145), and again on p. 182, where it
is added that this irrevocability of partitions is meant for cases where
the partition has been made by the objector himself;—and in
<em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 218), which explains the first clause to
mean that ‘a man obtains his share in a property only once,’ and adds
that what is said in regard to the ‘girl’ applies only to those cases
where there is no defect in the bridegroom (to whom the girl has been
betrothed).</p>

the produce—‘<em>belongs clearly to the owner of the soil</em>’— The term
‘<em>clearly</em>’ indicates that there is no doubt on this point.</p>
<p>‘<em>Because the receptacle is more important than the seed</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., more
importance attaches to the soil,—(52) In a case however, where there is
a compact, (what happens is as follows.)—</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 579), which explains the
meaning to be:—‘In a case where the owner of the field and the sower of
the seed are not parties to an agreement, the benefit accrues to the
former and not to the latter.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 3?0), which adds the
following explanation:—In a case where the ‘field-owner’ and the
‘seed-owner’ have entered into an agreement that ‘the child born would
belong to both of us,’ the child that is bora of the connection between
the former’s wife and the latter shall belong to both; but where there
has been no such agreement, and yet the latter ‘sows his seed’ in the
former’s ‘field,’ and a child is bora, it will belong to the
‘field-owner,’ and not to the ‘seed-owner;’ because the ‘receptacle’ is
more potent than the ‘seed,’ as is found in the case of the cow, the
sheep and other animals.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 656), which adds that
‘<em>phalānabhisandhāna</em>’ means the ‘absence of any such agreement as that
the child horn of this connection shall belong to both of us;’so that
the son thus born would be ‘<em>kṣetraja</em>’ and not ‘<em>dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa</em>.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.127), which adds a note the exact wording
of which has been reproduced in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 350)
[see above]. <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> has the following explanation of the verbal
construction:—‘<em>Kṣeṭriṇām bījinām</em>,’ ‘from among field-owners and
seed-owners,’ if either party has not agreed to the understanding
regarding the lending of the ‘field,’ then the child born belongs to the
‘field-owner;’ and the reason for this lies in the fact that ‘the
receptacle is more potent than the seed’;—and the reason for this is
declared to be ‘<em>pratyakṣam</em>,’ ‘ordinary perception’, <em>i</em>. <em>e</em>., such is
actually found to be the case in ordinary experience;—the ‘<em>phalam</em>’
spoken of in the text stands for the <em>agreement</em> regarding the child;—it
goes on to add that according to Medhātithi this verse serves to point
out the special circumstance under which the ‘benefit does not accrue to
the seed-sower,’ which has been stated in general terms in the preceding
verse.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 653);—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em>
(Vyavahāra, 185b), which adds the following explanation—‘In a case where
there has been no agreement regarding the <em>phala</em>, <em>i.e</em>., the expected
offspring,—the child belongs to the woman’s husband, just as we find in
the case where, without the knowledge or consent of the owner of the
field, if some one sows his own seeds in that field, the outturn of the
field belongs to the owner of the field, and not to that of the seeds.</p>

owner of the seed or to both? It. is in answer to this that the present
verse declares that it belongs to both.</p>
<p>^(‘)<em>Acceptance of the compact</em>.’—The term^(‘)<em>Kriyā</em>’ stands for the
compact, the agreement, that^(‘)this shall be so and so’;—when such
compact has been ‘accepted,’—‘<em>it’—i.e</em>., the ‘<em>seed</em>,’ as is clear from

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣara</em> (2.127) which adds the following
explanation:—In a case where the ‘field’ is lent to the seed-owner for
sowing, on the mutual understanding that the child born would belong to
both parties, both of them will be owners of the child, as has been
(<em>dṛṣṭa</em>) held by the great sages.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 656), which adds that the
term ‘<em>kriyā</em>’ here stands for the agreement that ‘the child born would

conditions that can be called ‘<em>Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa</em>.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 350), which adds the
following explanation:—‘In a case where the owner of the field lends his
field to the owner of the seed, after entering into an agreement with
him to the effect that the child born shall belong to both,—the child is
held to belong to both the parties.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 557), which adds that this rule
applies also to the case where the ‘seed-owner’ concerned may already
have sons of his own;—in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p..653);—in
<em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra 38a);—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra,
185b), which adds the following explanation:—A man has agricultural
land, and another has, the seed-grains,—the two enter into an agreement
‘let us, combine our resources and cultivate the land conjointly and the
out turn shall belong to both of us,’—in this case the crop belongs to
both; similarly when the husband of the wife enters into an agreement
with another man that ‘you beget a child on my wife and the child shall
belong to both of us,’ the child that is born belongs to both, and
having two fathers, he is called ‘<em>Dvyāṃvṣyāyaṇa</em>.’</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>It has been declared ([under
43])
that when a man sows his seed in another man’s soil, his seed is lost.
And on the basis people may have the following idea—“In the case cited,
it is only right that the produce shall be confiscated, since a wrong
act has been committed by the man, in that he has tried to obtain
surreptitious possession of the land,—otherwise, why should he go about
sowing his seed in another’s field? But in a case where the owner of the
seed has sown it in his own field, but it has been carried into another
field by water or wind, there is no wrong done by the man; in fact he
loses his own seed by this transference.”</p>
<p>It is with a view to combat such a notion that we have the present verse
declaring that when ‘<em>seed, carried away by rain or wind</em>’—‘<em>ogha</em>’
stands for <em>rain</em>,—‘<em>germinates in another man’s field</em>’,—then, the
produce belongs to the owner of the soil.</p>
<p>Thus is the special law established that ‘<em>the owner of the seed does
receive the produce</em>’; <em>i.e</em>., ownership of the soil is the more
important factor.—(54)</p>

as ‘earned,’ and adds that this also only serves to indicate the greater
importance of the ‘field’;—and in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 521).</p>

<p>Cows and horses, etc. are added here in order to prevent the notion
being entertained that the laws laid down here are meant only for
children; or it may be regarded as added for the purpose of precluding
the notion that they are meant to apply to only seeds, fruits and crops,
as is already known among people.</p>
<p>The same law applies to quadrupeds, and bipeds, as also to immovable
things.</p>
<p>‘<em>This</em>’—refers to what has been said in the preceding two
verses:—<em>viz</em>. (1) when there is no compact, the produce belongs to the
owner of the soil, and (2) when there is compact, it belongs to both.</p>
<p>Cows and the rest have been named only by way of illustration; the same
law applies to the cases of dogs, cats and other animals.</p>
<p>“Why then should the declaration in verse 50 have been made?”</p>
<p>It is only a reiteration of the well-known fact that birds and other
animals do not form the ‘property’ of men to the same extent as cows do.</p>
<p>‘<em>Slave girls</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., those acquired by the seven sources of slavery.</p>
<p>‘<em>Offspring</em>’— young ones born from their wombs.—(55)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 580), which explains ‘<em>eṣa

the fruit;’—also in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (II, p. 150), which adds that the term
‘<em>dāsī</em>’ here stands for the slave-girl married to another slave; the
child of such a slave-girl belongs to the owner of the girl, not to that
of the father;—and in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 521 and 574).</p>

<p>This verse enjoins the practice of ‘<em>Niyoga</em>’, hemmed in by all its
qualifications.</p>
<p>‘On <em>failure of issue, the woman, on being authorised, may obtain,
offspring in the proper manner</em>,’—from her younger brother-in-law and
others.</p>
<p>This ‘<em>failure of issue</em>’ is the ‘distress’ referred to under verse 56.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>issue</em>’, ‘<em>antāna</em>’, here stands for the <em>son</em>; as regards
the <em>daughter</em>, she is regarded as^(‘)issue’ only when she has been
‘appointed,’ as it is only then that she <em>carries on</em> (‘<em>santanoti</em>’),
perpetuates, her father’s family; which is not done by the daughter, in
ordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>failure</em>’ of such issue consists in no son being born, or in a
son, though born, dying off, and in the <em>non-appointment</em> of a daughter
(by the husband). We shall explain later on that the woman is not
entitled to have an ‘appointed daughter’ or any other substitute for the
son. She may, therefore bring forth a child only when authorised by her
elders.</p>
<p>“Whence is the idea obtained that the authorisation is to be done <em>by
her elders</em>?”</p>
<p>It is obtained from other Smṛti-texts. Or, the idea follows from the
very name ‘<em>niyoga</em>’, ‘authorisation’. In ordinary parlance
‘authorisation’ is always understood as proceeding from a superior; when
the teacher does the teaching, he is not spoken of as being ‘authorised’
by his pupil to do it; in fact it is the pupil that is spoken of as
being ‘authorised’ to read and repeat the lessons.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>elders</em>’ meant here are the mother-in-law, the father-in-law, the
younger brother-in-law and other persons belonging to her husband’s
family,—and not the woman’s own father and other relations. Because if a
child is born as the result of this ‘authorisation’, it is only the
former who come to be known as ‘with offspring’, and who become
benefitted by the after-death rites performed by that child.</p>
<p>“If that were the sole criterion, then, since the child’s maternal
grandfather also would benefit by the rites performed by his
grand-child, it would follow that the said ‘authorisation’ could be done
by him also.”</p>
<p>This has been already answered by the explanation that those persons
alone are to ‘authorise’ who would become known as ‘with offspring’
through the child born as the result of that authorisation. Further,
when the verse speaks of the ‘<em>younger brother-in-law</em>’ and the
‘<em>sapiṇḍa</em>’, all persons belonging to the same <em>gotra</em> come to the mind.
In the <em>Mahābhārata</em> also, in several places, it is shown that
‘authorisation’ can proceed only from the woman’s relations on the
husband’s side. It is for this same reason that there is to be no
‘authorisation’ when the husband’s brother’s son is present.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, the benefits from the issue occur to only those
persons who are ‘authorised’ to beget the offspring; in fact only those
persons are entitled to ‘authorisation’ who are eager to obtain the
benefits of the issue, in the shape of the love and satisfaction derived
from the son. Thus then, no benefits can occur to one who is dead; how
then can the child be said to be the ‘issue’ of the latter?”</p>
<p>Our answer to this is that the dead person also does obtain benefits, in
the shape of the offering of libations and so forth; and that this is so
is clearly asserted in authoritative texts. Though it is true that the
dead person has not carried out the injunction regarding the begetting
of a child; yet the scriptures clearly lay down that libations are
offered to him by the child that may be begotten in the ‘soil’ belonging
to him, (<em>i.e</em>. on his wife), according to the law of ‘authorisation’.
And from this it follows that benefits for the issue do accrue to the
dead father also. How this is we shall explain fully later on.</p>
<p>‘<em>Younger brother-in-law</em>’—the husband’s brother.</p>
<p>‘<em>Sapiṇḍa</em>’—a person belonging to the husband’s family. This is what is
understood to be meant by the law in other Smṛti-texts regarding the
child being obtained from any person ‘<em>of the same caste</em>’.</p>
<p>‘<em>In the proper manner</em>’.—This refers to the rules regarding the man
annotating himself with clarified butter and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>The desired offspring may be obtained</em>’— The verbal affix has the
force of the Injunctive. The term ‘<em>desired</em>’ indicates the capacity for
fulfilling his duties; which implies that in the event of a girl or a
blind or deaf son being born, the process of ‘authorisation’ may be
repeated.—(59)</p>

<p>‘<em>Santānasya</em>’—‘Son, and also the appointed daughter’
(Medhātithi);—‘Son’ (Govindarāja and Rāghavānanda).</p>
<p>“This practice is forbidden in Āpastamba 2.27.2-7; if the husband is
alive; but with the widow, it is expressly enjoined by Gautama 78.4 and
28.21-22, and Vaśiṣṭha 17.56. Nārada gives an elaborate account of the
formalities. See Jolly, Recht. Stellung S. 18, where the passage is
discussed.”—Hopkins.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.127) as propounding the practice
of ‘<em>niyoga</em>’ for the purpose of forbidding it under verse 64 <em>et
seq</em>.—<em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds the notes:—‘<em>Samyak</em>,’ in accordance with the
scriptures,—‘<em>īpsitā</em>,’ in the form of a son,—‘<em>kṣaye</em>,’ in the event of
threatened extinction of the family; this means that the practice is
sanctioned only under very abnormal circumstances;—‘<em>vāg-yataḥ</em>,’
silent;—it then goes on to quote Medhātithi.</p>
<p>(59) is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 445)—and both the verses in
<em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 350); and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra,
p. 737) which remarks that the term ‘<em>vidhavā</em>’ in this verse stands for
the girl whose betrothed husband has died after the betrothal, but
<em>before</em> actual marriage.</p>
<p>Both verses are quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 700);—in
<em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 38a);—and in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra,
pp. 224-225), which explains the meaning as—“The widow, when directed by
the father-in-law or other elders, may beget a desired (<em>i.e</em>., male)
child from her husband’s (elder or younger) brother,—but only one;
although some people hold that she may secure two sons.’</p>

<p>(See below, verse 64 <em>et seq</em>.)</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (18.4-7).—‘A woman whose husband is dead and who desires
offspring may bear a son to her brother-in-iaw. She should obtain the
permission of her elders and should have intercourse during her period
only. On failure of her brother-in-law, she may obtain offspring from a
<em>Sapiṇḍa</em>, a <em>Sayotra</em>, a <em>Samānapravara</em> or from one belonging to the
same caste. Some people hold that she should do this with none hut her
brother-in-law.’</p>
<p>Do. (28.22-23).—‘The widow may seek to raise up offspring to her
deceased husband. A son begotten on a widow, whose brother-in-law is
alive, by another relative, is excluded from inheritance.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (2.4.9-10).—‘After the expiry of six months from her
husband’s death, she may, with the authority of her elders, bear a son
to her brother-in-law, in case she has no son. They quote the
following:—“A barren woman or one who has already borne sons, or one who
is past childhearing, or one whose children are all dead, or one who is
unwilling, must never be authorised or appointed to do this.”’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.56).—‘After the completion of six months from the death
of her husband, she shall bathe, and offer a funeral oblation to the
husband. Then her father and brother shall assemble the elders who
taught or sacrificed for her husband, as also his relatives, and
authorise her to raise issue to her deceased husband. One should not
thus appoint a widow who is either mad or ill-behaved or diseased; nor
one who is very aged;—sixteen years after maturity is the period for
authorising a widow. Nor shall such an authorisation be made if the male
entitled to approach her is sickly.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (1.68-69).—‘If a widow is without a son, her
brother-in-law, or a <em>Sapiṇḍa</em> or a <em>Sagotra</em>,—smeared with butter,
shall approach her during her period, being authorised to do so by the
elders, for the purpose of obtaining a son for her. He shall approach
her only till conception has taken place; doing otherwise, he would
become an outcast. The son born in this manner is called <em>Kṣetraja</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.12-14).—‘The <em>Niyoga</em> (authorisation of a widow to raise
offspring to her deceased husband), after having been declared by Manu,
has been forbidden by himself; on account of the deterioration in the
nature of the time-cycles, this cannot he done by all in the proper
form. In the <em>Kṛta</em>, <em>Tretā</em> and <em>Dvāpara</em> cycles, men were imbued with
austerities and with knowledge; in the <em>Kali</em> cycle a deterioration in
the capacity of men has been brought about. Therefore the sons that were
obtained by various methods by the ancient sages cannot he obtained by
men now, on account of their being without that capacity.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (12.80-81).—‘Should the husband of a childless woman die, she
should go to her brother-in-law, through desire to obtain a son, after
having received the necessary authorisation from her elders;—and he
shall have intercourse with her till a son is born. When a son is born,
he must leave her. It would be sinful intercourse otherwise.’</p>
<p><em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> (Aparārka, p. 97).—‘On the death of her husband, or on
her having abandoned her husband, a woman may beget a son from a man of
her own caste. If she is a child-widow, or has been forcibly abandoned
by her husband, she shall go through the sacrament of marriage again,
with any other man. But this remarriage of women, or the begetting of a
son from the brother-in-law, or the freedom of women, should not be
permitted during the <em>Kali</em> age; as during this age, men are inclined to
be sinful.’</p>
<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (2.27.2-4).—‘A husband shall not make over his wife, who
occupies the position of a <em>gentilis</em>, to others (than to his
<em>gentiles</em>), in order to cause children to be begotten for himself. For
they declare that a bride is given to the family of her husband (and not
to the husband alone). This is forbidden for the present age, on account
of the incapacity of men’s senses.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 446).—‘A man desirous of securing offspring
for bis dead brother, may beget a child on his widow; he shall leave her
as soon as conception has taken place; he shall never approach her after
she has got a child.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Do., 449).—‘After having carried out <em>Niyoga</em>, one should
perform the prescribed penance for expiation.’</p>

<p>No significance is meant to be attached to the mention of the.
‘<em>widow</em>’; as the rule laid down here is applicable also to the case of
the woman whose husband is alive, but subject to such disabilities as
impotence and the like. That such is the meaning is clear from what
follows later (in 63). As a matter of fact, the sole purpose underlying
the practice lies in what is stated in the present verse; the
restriction too pertains to persons subject to the law, and not to the
observances themselves. Otherwise it would seem that the whole thing
pertained to widows only. (?)</p>
<p>‘<em>At</em> <em>night</em>—this is meant to indicate the <em>absence of all light</em>, in
the shape of lamps etc.; intercourse <em>during the day</em> having been
already forbidden by another text.</p>
<p>Others however hold that the prohibition of intercourse during the day
is with reference to the benefit of the man, while the specification of
‘night’ in the present text bears upon ritualistic purposes.</p>
<p>Hence what is meant is that ‘<em>only one</em>.’—and never a
second—‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ son is to be begotten; but never by intercourse
during the day.—(60)</p>
<p>An exception to this is set forth in the next verse:—</p>

<p>[(See texts under

<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.61, <em>et seq</em>.).—‘He shall approach the widow in the
moment sacred to Prajāpati, behaving like a husband, without dallying
with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her. She shall obtain the
expenses for food, raiment, baths and unguents from the estate of her
deceased husband. They declare that a son begotten on a widow not duly
authorised belongs to the begetter; if she has been duly authorised, the
child belongs to both the males connected with the authorisation. No
such authorisation shall be made for the purpose of obtaining a living.
But some people declare that an authorisation may be made through desire
for wealth, after an expiatory penance has been performed.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (1.68-69).—(See under 59.)</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (18.8).—‘She shall not bear more than two sons.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (12.82-88).—‘He shall approach the woman, free from passion,
and without amorous desire. He must have anointed his limbs with
clarified butter, or with oil which has not lost its natural condition,
and must turn away his face from hers and avoid the contact of limb with
limb. For this custom is practised only when the family threatens to
become extinct, for the continuance of the lineage, and not from amorous
desire. He must not approach a woman who is with child, or blameworthy,
or not duly authorised by her relations. Should a woman procreate a son
with her brother-in-law without having been authorised thereto by her
relations, that son is declared illegitimate and incapable of
inheriting, by the expounders of the Veda. So when a younger brother has
intercourse, without authorisation, with the wife of his elder
brother,—or an elder brother with the wife of his younger brother,—they
are both held to have committed incest. If he has been authorised by the
elders, he shall approach the woman and advise her in the manner
previously stated, as if she were his daughter-in-law. He becomes
purified of the sin when the son is born and his Birth-ceremonies have
been performed. He shall approach her only once,—or till conception has
taken place. When she has become pregnant, she is again even as a
daughter-in-law to him. Should the man or woman behave otherwise,
impelled by amorous desire, they shall be severely punished by the King.
Otherwise righteousness would be violated.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 446).—‘When during her period, the woman has
taken her bath, her brother-in-law, desiring an offspring for his
deceased brother, may approach her during the dark night, with speech
held in check, with a single cloth on, and his body anointed with
clarified butter, and mind stricken with grief, avoiding the contact of
his face and limbs with her face and limbs.’</p>

<p>A second son also should be begotten;—such is the opinion of some
people.</p>
<p>‘<em>Learned in the subject</em>’—persons versed in the laws relating to the
<em>begetting</em> of ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ sons.</p>
<p>‘<em>Perceiving that the purpose of authorisation is not
accomplished</em>’.—These people hold that the injunction, that ‘the woman
on being authorised should begot a child’, is not fulfilled by the
begetting of a single son.</p>
<p>What is the real intention of these men?</p>
<p>They hold that the singular number (in the word ‘son’ in the injunction
‘a son is to be begotten’) is not meant to be significant; since it is
the <em>substance</em> that forms the more important factor, and no
qualification attaches to the act, which shows that no significance can
attach to the singular number; just as in the case of the word ‘cup’ (in
the injunction ‘wash the cup’).</p>
<p>“In the case of injunctions of things not already spoken of elsewhere,
even though the <em>substance</em> is recognised as the predominant factor, yet
the significance of such specifications as those by means of number and
such qualifications remains undisturbed; <em>e.g</em>., in such injunctions as
the ‘twice-born man shall marry <em>a woman</em>’. Then from the indicative
power of such mantra-texts as ‘Beget ten sons on this girl’, it is clear
that the number <em>one</em> as pertaining to <em>children</em> is not to be observed.</p>
<p>“In that case the man need not rest with <em>two</em> sons only.” In fact it is
in view of this that the text has added the term ‘<em>second</em>’, the use
whereof lies in the precluding of the possibility of more sons than two.
This same is the sense of the <em>mantra-text</em> also, which pertains to the
‘<em>aurasa</em>’ (body-born) son, the text occuring in the section on
Marriage. In the present instance however, all that is intended is the
exceeding of the number ‘one’; and this on the strength of the saying
current, among cultured people that ‘a man with one son is as good as
sonless’, or on that of the present verse containing the eulogisation of
the second son.</p>
<p>‘<em>On</em> <em>the</em> <em>basis of propriety</em>’—<em>i.e</em>. on the strength of the practice
of cultured people.—(61)</p>

behaviour towards each other should be like that of the ‘elder’ and the

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>This is the prohibition of the practice of ‘authorisation’, which has
been sanctioned in the foregoing texts.</p>
<p>In this connection, some people have held the following view:—“Inasmuch
as the text contains the term ‘<em>widow</em>’, it prohibits the practice only
with reference to the woman whose husband is dead; so that the impotent
husband should still ‘authorise’ his wife; both the sanction and the
prohibition would thus have distinct spheres of application.”</p>
<p>Others, however, have held the following opinion:—“The text, that
sanctions the practice mentions the <em>failure of issue</em> as the occasion
for it; and as a matter of fact, this occasion is equally present in
both cases,—in the case of the husband being impotent or invalided, as
also in that of his being dead. So that as the sanction, so the
prohibition also, must be accepted as free from restrictions. Then
again, a woman is called ‘<em>vidhavā</em>’ (widow) when she ceases to have any
intercourse with her ‘<em>dhava</em>’ or husband; and this condition is equally
present in both cases.”</p>
<p>It is this latter view that has to be accepted; as otherwise, the rules
regarding ‘anointment with clarified butter’ and other details would not
be applicable to the case of ‘authorisation’ by the impotent or
invalided husband; because the text that lays down that rule uses the
term ‘widow’—“He who has been authorised <em>in regard to the widow</em>, etc.’
(Verse 60). For these reasons, just as the preceding sanction, so the
subsequent prohibition also, should be taken as free from all
limitations. And thus the sphere of application of both being the same,
we must take the case as being one of <em>option</em>. This option is possible
only in view of the obligatory character of the injunction regarding the
begetting of children; the case being analogous to the option bearing
upon the ‘holding’ and ‘not holding’ of the <em>Śoḍaśi</em> Cups. If, on the
other hand, the injunction of begetting a son were regarded as
consisting in such assertions as ‘by means of a son one wins heaven’,
and so forth, (where the act of begetting a son is put forward as
loading to a certain desirable result), the effect of one having no
children would only be the non-performance of the after-death rites. So
that the results of the two acts (begetting of a child by
‘authorisation’ and not begetting a. child by that method) would be
totally distinct; and under the circumstances, whence could there he any
<em>option</em>? It is only when the sanction and the prohibition both hear
upon the same object that there can be <em>option</em>; as is the case with the
‘holding’ and ‘not holding’ of the <em>Śoḍaśi</em> Cups.</p>
<p>It has already been pointed out that when an act is done along with all
its subsidiary details, its results are fuller than what they are when
it is done without those details; but so far as the accomplishment of
the main act itself is concerned, there is no difference. So that, in
this case the only effect would be that the man not having recourse to
the practice would fail to obtain the benefits that would he conferred
by the son; and if he has recourse to the practice with a view to
obtaining those special benefits, then he would he transgressing the
prohibition, and his act would stand on the same footing as the
performance of the <em>Śyena</em> sacrififie (which is performed for the
special purpose of obtaining the death of the enemy, and involves the
transgression of the prohibition of all <em>hilling</em>).</p>
<p>“In connection with this object, the following point deserves to be
considered in regard to the man who is ‘authorised’ (to have connection
with the ‘widow’)—Why does he have recourse to the act? There is no such
injunction for him as that ‘when one is <em>authorised</em> he should have
intercourse with the widow’; as there <em>is</em> for the woman, in the form of
the text (59)—‘the woman, being duly authorised, etc.’ It would not be
right to argue that—“since the ‘authorisation’ of the woman can he
accomplished only when her younger brother-in-law or some other male
relation would also ad, the action of these latter also is implied by
that same injunction (which prescribes the^(‘)authorisation’ of the
woman),—since what is desired by the women is the <em>Kṣetraja</em> son (and
this cannot be obtained without the action of the male).”</p>
<p>“This cannot be right, because the action of tin; male might proceed
from carnal desire also.</p>
<p>“If the injunction did not imply the action of the male, there would be
no sense in the rules laying down <em>anointing with clarified butter</em> and
other details.</p>
<p>“These rules would not he meaningless; as their meaning would he that
the son can he called ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ only when he is born in the manner
prescribed, and in no other circumstances.</p>
<p>“Some people have leld that the general injunction that ‘one must obey
the injunction of his elders’ is what prompts the male in question.</p>
<p>“But if this were allowed, then one would he justified in drinking wine
and doing such forbidden ads, by the wish of his elders to do so. As a
matter of fact, one who would prompt the man to have recourse to such
acts would not be an ‘elder’ at all. Then again, there is the law—‘The
abandoning of the elder is enjoined, if he is vain or ignorant of what
should and what should not be done, or has recourse to the wrong path’;
and the ‘abandoning’ meant here can only consist in <em>ceasing to work for
the elder</em>.</p>
<p>“This same reasoning does away with the following view also:—‘The
assertion, (in 63) that by acting contrary to the rules relating to the
details of the practice of ‘authorisation,’ the parties concerned become
outcasts, implies the sanctioning of the action of both, in accordance
with those rules. Otherwise, if the action of the man involved the
penalty of outcasting in all kinds of intercourse, there would be no
point in the declaration that he becomes an outcast under the special
circumstances (of acting contrary to the rules).’</p>
<p>“Then again, the idea, that—‘in the case of there being no transgression
of the rules the man alone becomes an outcast, whereas, when there is
transgression of them, both parties become outcasts’—is also derived
from the indicative power of the texts themselves.</p>
<p>“Thus then, the action of the youger brother in-law and other male
relations has got to be explained (and justified).”</p>
<p>Our explanation is as follows:—Judging from the instance of Vyāsa and
others, it has to be admitted that, in the begetting of the ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’
son, if one acts according to the behests of his elders, there can be
nothing wrong in it In the case of Vyāsa and other great men, their
action can never be regarded as having been prompted by carnal desire.’
Then, as for the argument that “the assertion that the parties become
outcasts if they transgress the rules, is indicative of the act of the
male”.—this cannot be right; for, if the male became an outcast, then,
the son born of him would not be entitled to the performance of any
rites; so that the begetting of the child would be absolutely futile.
From all this, it follows that there is just a semblance of an
injunction for the action of the younger brother-in-law or other male
relations.—(64)</p>

<p>“Verses 64-68 flatly contradict the rules given in the preceding ones.
But it by no means follows that they are a modern addition, as held by
Hopkins. For the same view is expressed by Āpastamba, 2.27.2-6, and was
held, according to Baudhāyana, 2.3.34, by Aupajandhani. Moreover,
Bṛhaspati Smṛti states expressly (Colebrook Dig. CLVII) that the
contradictory statement occurred in the Mānava Dharmaśātra as known to
the author.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.136), as prohibiting
<em>niyoga</em>;—again under 2.127, to the same effect, where <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em>
adds that ‘<em>anyasmin</em>’ means ‘other than the husband.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 737), which remarks that
the term ‘<em>vidhavā</em>’ here stands for the woman, whose husband has died
after the marriage has been performed;—then it seeks to reconcile the
apparent contradiction between verses 59 and 60 (permitting <em>Niyoga</em>) on
the one hand, and verses 64-68 (forbidding it) on the other; the
sanction is meant for the girl who is widowed after verbal betrothal,
before marriage; while the prohibition applies to one who is widowed
after marriage; this, it adds, is made clear by verse 65, which refers
to the ‘mantras recited during the marriage-ceremony.’ It concludes
therefore that there is no room for any doubts regarding the opinion of
Manu, adumbrated in <em>Mitākṣarā</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, 38a);—in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 226), which says that this prohibition is meant for the
<em>Kali-age</em>;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra, 186a).</p>

<p>‘<em>Udvāha</em>,’ ‘marriage,’ is a <em>rite</em>; and the sacred texts used at that
rite—such as; (<em>a</em>) ‘<em>Aryamaṇannu devam kanyā agnimayakṣata</em>,’ (<em>b</em>)
‘<em>Mayā patyā jaradaṣṭih</em>,’ (<em>c</em>) ‘<em>Mayā patyā prajāvatī</em>,’ and so
forth,—in all these, it is clearly stated that ownership over the woman
belongs to the person that <em>marries</em> her; and nowhere among them is
there any such assertion as ‘beget a child from a man in regard to whom
you are <em>authorised</em> by me.’</p>
<p>What the text means by mentioning the ‘<em>mantra-texts</em>’ is that even
<em>Mantra-texts</em> and <em>Declamatory Texts</em> do not contain any indications of
the injunction of the practice. This is further explained.—‘<em>The
marriage of widows is not mentioned in the injunction of marriage</em>.’
‘Marriage’ here stands for <em>intercourse</em>. If the act of the
brother-in-law having intercourse with his widowed sister-in-law were a
regular ‘marriage,’ then, the practice of ‘<em>niyoga</em>,’ ‘authorisation’,
would be the same as ‘Marriage’; and as such, it would be fully
<em>enjoined</em> by some such injunction as ‘the brother-in-law shall marry
his sister-in-law.’ As a matter of fact, however, there is no such
injunction at all.</p>
<p>This is a declamatory supplement to what has gone before.—(65)</p>

<p>This also is a declamatory supplement to the prohibition of
‘authorisation.’ The ‘<em>ignorant</em>’ men, who do not know the scriptures,
and who do not understand that the indicative power of the texts points
to something entirely different,—‘<em>introduced</em>’ ‘<em>this bestial
practice</em>,’ which is most ‘<em>reprehensible</em>,’ ‘<em>among men also</em>’; and
this was done not during modern times, but ‘<em>during the</em> <em>time that
Vena</em>’—(he first king—‘<em>was ruling over his kingdom</em>’—looking after his
realm.</p>
<p>“It has been said that there are no sacred texts indicative of
prevalence of this practice.”</p>
<p>Not so; what was said was that there was no such indicative in the texts
recited at marriage; in other texts there certainly are words indicative
of it; for instance, there is the <em>mantra</em>—‘<em>Ko vā sa putro vidhaveva
deraram mayā nu doṣo kṛṇute sadhastha</em>’ (Ṛgveda, 10.40.2),—which means
‘who is the woman that invites you Aśvins to her bed in the manner in
which the widow invites to her bed her younger brother-in-law,—that you
do not come up?’</p>
<p>“But what peculiarity is there in the <em>mantras</em> used at marriage (that
capital is made of there being no indication <em>in them</em> of the practice
in question)?”</p>
<p>What is meant is that the texts connected with marriage are more nearly
connected with the subject of the begetting of children.</p>
<p>Others read ‘<em>vidvadbhiḥ</em>’ (for ‘<em>avidvadbhiḥ</em>’); and the meaning of
this would be—‘This practice, of having intercourse with the brother’s
wife, which is fit for beasts, <em>has been declared</em> <em>by</em> <em>the learned to
be reprehensible, for men</em>,—and it was introduced during the reign of
King Vena.’—(66)</p>

<p>This verse lays down a practice in connection with maidens, which has
the form of ‘authorization’.</p>
<p>‘<em>After the troth has been verbally plighted</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., alter the
accomplishment of verbal betrothal;—when she has been given away orally
by one and accepted by the other party.</p>
<p>‘<em>Her own younger brother-in-law shall espouse</em>’—marry—‘<em>her, in the
following manner</em>’—(69)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (1.69), as enunciating the view that
the sanction of the ‘<em>kṣeṭraja</em>’ son pertains only to those cases where
the bridegroom has died after the verbal betrothal;—again under 2.127,
as describing the case in which alone ‘<em>niyoga</em>’ is permissible;—and it
adds that this verse implies that the man to whom a girl has been
betrothed has become her ‘husband’ even before the marriage rites have
been performed.</p>
<p><em>Mitākṣarā</em> adds the following notes:—When the ‘husband’ to whom the
girl has been betrothed dies, then his ‘own’ <em>i.e</em>., uterine brother,
elder or younger, ‘<em>vindeta</em>,’ shall take her, <em>i.e</em>., marry her. It
construes ‘<em>anena vidhānena</em>’ with the next verse.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (II, p. 129), to the effect that the child
born under this rule belongs to the person to whom the girl had been
previously betrothed;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 78), which also notes that this
verse serves to restrict the sanction of ‘<em>niyoga</em>’ or of ‘marriage of
widows’ to cases of mere <em>betrothal</em>, not of actual <em>marriage</em>;—in
<em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 351), to the same effect; and it adds
that for this reason the foregoing conflicting verses 59-68 should not
be understood as setting forth two optional alternatives;—and in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 737), to the effect that ‘<em>niyoga</em>’ does
not mean mere <em>intercourse</em>, without marriage, it means <em>marriage</em> and
then intercourse;—and again on p. 756, as laying down the marrying of
the girl by her younger brother-in-law, on the death of her (betrothed)
husband.</p>

been promised to him verbally and by a libation of water,—but before she
was married to him with the sacred texts,—she belongs to her father
alone. If a damsel has been abducted by force, and not wedded with the
sacred texts, she may lawfully he given to another man; she is even like
a maiden. If before the death of her husband, the damsel had merely been
wedded with the sacred texts, and the marriage had not been consummated,
she may be married again.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 739).—‘If a man should die or

<p>‘<em>According to rule</em>’—in accordance with the rules laid down in the
scriptures.</p>
<p>‘<em>Has espoused her</em>’—This would be ‘espousal’ or ‘marriage’ only in
name; as the maiden in such a case would he called a ‘<em>punarbhū</em>,’ ‘a
remarried widow’; and even though married, she could not be a ‘wife’ (in
the real sense of the term); her marriage, which is nominal, being only
for a defenite purpose. That this is so is shown in the next
verse—‘Having given away his daughter to one man, one shall not give her
to another,’—which means, that she should not be given to her younger
brother-in-law either; and when she is not <em>given away</em>—and as such does
not become the property of the man—how could she he his ‘wife’?</p>
<p>‘<em>Clad in white garments</em>’;—this is a rule that is to be observed by the
man approaching the woman; it is to be observed also in other cases of
‘authorisation.’—(70)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted along with 69 in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.127), which adds
the following notes:—‘<em>Yathāvidhi</em>,’ in accordance with the
scriptures,—‘<em>adhigamya</em>’, having married,—‘<em>anena vidhānena</em>,’ (of the
preceding verse) <em>i.e</em>., ‘besmearing himself with clarified butter, with
speech held in check and so forth’,—‘<em>śuklavastrām śucivratām</em>,’ with
her mind and body under full control,—‘<em>mithaḥ</em>,’ in secret,—shall
approach her once during each course, till conception takes place. It
proceeds to declare that all this does not make the woman the actual
‘wife’ of the brother-in-law; hence the child bora of this union belongs
to the real (<em>i.e</em>., the former) husband;—<em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds that the
action of the brother-in-law is purely for the purpose of providing a
child for his dead brother; it goes on to add the following notes
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa remarks that the fact of the child born of the
intercourse here sanctioned belonging to the dead betrothed is clear
from the restriction imposed, that there is to be intercourse only
<em>once</em> during the course, and that also only until conception takes
place.—Having thus stated the view of the older writers, <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em>
enters into a long discussion and comes to the conclusion that the
sanction of remarriage must refer to a regular <em>widow</em>—who loses her
real husband after full marriage, and not only after betrothal; and it
naively remarks that the opinion of the older writers is due to
prejudice against ‘<em>niyoga</em>,’ by reason of its having been forbidden

<p>It has been declared ‘that consummation of it is to be understood as
occurring at the seventh step’
[(8.227)].
People may be inclined to the notion that if the bridegroom dies before
this point has been reached, the girl may be given away to another man;
it is this notion that the present text, precludes.</p>
<p>This prohibition has been repeated here, in view of the special
circumstances herein mentioned; as a matter of fact, the girl married
after betrothal has been already declared to be a ‘remarried widow.’</p>
<p>When the girl has been betrothed, given away, to one man,—if he happens
to die—she shall not be given to another. By doing this the father
incurs the guilt of ‘<em>fraud towards men</em>’; —<em>i.e</em>., he incurs the same
guilt that would be incurred by the kidnapping of a human being.—(71)</p>

<p>‘<em>Form</em>’—as prescribed in the scriptures; what is done in accordance
with this—<em>i.e</em>., as laid down in 3.35 <em>et-seq</em>,—where the use of water
has been held by some to be meant for the case of maidens.</p>
<p>When one has, according to this form, accepted a maiden,—he may
‘<em>repudiate</em>, <em>her</em>’—before marriage is done.</p>
<p>‘<em>Blemished</em>’—disfigured by evil bodily marks, not perceived before.
Even though she may have been accepted, and be very handsome, yet if she
be found to be wanting in modesty, or harsh of tongue.</p>
<p>‘<em>Diseased</em>’— suffering from consumption.</p>
<p>‘<em>Corrupted</em>’—one who is known among men as suffering from an incurable
disease, or as being in love with another man.</p>
<p>Such a girl one may repudiate.</p>
<p>Some people have explained ‘<em>vipraduṣṭā</em>’ as ‘deflowered.’</p>
<p>This however is not accepted by others as right. So long as the girl has
not been enjoyed by a man, and as such remains a ‘maiden,’ she cannot be
regarded as ‘corrupted’; and after she has been enjoyed, she is no
longer a ‘maiden’; so that in this case there could be no sense in the
assertion that ‘one may repudiate the corrupted <em>maiden</em>.’ And the
abandoning of the ‘deflowerd’ girl has been already laid down before
(under 8.226).</p>
<p>‘<em>Betrothed by deception</em>’—actually wanting in limbs, or having
superfluous limbs.</p>
<p>Since the text mentions the presence of defects as the ground for
repudiation, it follows that even in the presence of such minor defects
as are not mentioned here,—one may abandon the girl, even after
betrothal.—(72)</p>

<p>‘<em>Vipraduṣṭām</em>’—‘Blemished, by bodily defects’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka,

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 492), to the effect
that it is not only the giver of a defective maiden that is to be
punished, but the girl herself is to be renounced in <em>Madanapārijāta</em>
(p. 154), which adds the following notes:—‘<em>Vipraduṣṭā</em>’ is one who
entertains longings for another man,—‘<em>Chadmanā</em>’, by showing to the
bridegrom a girl other than the one to be married;—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em>
(Saṃskāra, p. 744), which adds the following notes:—</p>
<p>‘<em>Vigarhitām</em>’, already previously married, but ‘impenetrated;’ it
quotes Medhātithi’s words as ‘<em>pūrvam pratigṛhītām akṣatayonimapi</em>’;
‘<em>vipraduṣṭām</em>,’ having her affections centred in another man;—in
<em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 106), which explains ‘<em>vigarhitām</em>,’ as
‘defective’;—and in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 221), as laying down
the divorcing of a girl, after the detection of some defect in her,—it
explains ‘<em>vipraduṣṭām</em>’ as ‘<em>vividham prakarṣeṇa duṣṭām</em>,’ ‘having
<em>several serious</em> defects.’</p>

<p>All that is meant by the injunction here put forth is that whenever a
man goes abroad, he should do so after having made provision for his
wife’s subsistence; the form of the injunction being—‘one going abroad
should make provision for the subsistence of his wife’; that is, he
should so arrange it that during the time that he is away, she shall be
supplied with means of sustaining her body, with food, clothing and
other household requisites.</p>
<p>Having provided for all this, he shall^(‘)<em>go abroad</em>,’ <em>i.e</em>., go away
to foreign lands.</p>
<p>‘<em>Having business</em>.’—‘<em>Business</em>’ stands for the man’s purpose, visible
(temporal) as well as invisible (spritual); the latter consisting in
‘merit’ and the former in ‘wealth’ and ‘pleasure.’ This same idea is
going to be set forth again (in 76)—‘If the man has gone abroad for the
purposes of merit, etc.’</p>
<p>This text forbids journeying abroad and leaving the wife behind, in the
absence of some such purpose as those herein mentioned.</p>
<p>‘<em>Distressed by want of</em> <em>subsistence</em>.’—This points out a visible harm
likely to arise; and is a purely declamatory assertion.
‘<em>Distressed</em>’—troubled—‘<em>by want of subsistence</em>’— by poverty.</p>
<p>‘<em>May</em> <em>become corrupt</em>’—by intercourse with other men.</p>
<p>‘<em>Even though virtuous</em>.’—‘<em>Virtue</em>’ stands for the customs and ways of
the family; and she who keeps up these is ‘<em>virtuous</em>.’</p>
<p>It is quite likely that through hunger and other forms of privation, the
distressed wife may fall into corruption, and maintain herself by
betaking herself to another ‘husband.’ The affix in ‘<em>praduṣyet</em>’
indicates likelihood—(74)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>It has been said that a man may go abroad ‘on business’; the present
verse proceeds to show the several kinds of ‘business,’—the time of
waiting varying with the nature of the business.</p>
<p>The text has said nothing as to what the wife should do after having
waited for the eight years. And on this point, some people on the
strength of Context, say that she should maintain herself by
unobjectionable industries.</p>
<p>This however is not right Because, if the maintaining of herself by
unobjectionable industries referred to the time after the eight years of
waiting,—then, before the⁻ lapse of that time, is she to die? Suicide is
not considered desirable for her, just as it is not for the man; being,
as it is, forbidden for all. Hence, the conclusion appears to be that
before the lapse of the said time she shall maintain herself by
unobjectionable industries; but after that she may have recourse to
objectionable ones also.</p>
<p>Others hold that after the said time, the woman may deviate from
chastity;—as says smother Smṛti text—‘When the husband is lost, or dead,
or become a renunciate, or impotent, or an outcast—in the event of these
five calamities smother husband is permitted for women.’ (Parāśara).</p>
<p>Others again hold the following view:—Even in ignorance, it is not open
to the woman to renounce her chastity. In fact, it has been laid down
among the duties of women (under 5.156) that ‘on the death of her
husband she shall not even utter the name of another man’; so that
deviation from chastity is not permissible even on the death of her
husband,—what to say as to when he has only gone abroad. As regards the
Smṛti-text quoted, the word ‘<em>pati</em>’ ‘husband,’ is used there in the
sense of <em>protector</em>, just as in the case of such terms as
‘<em>grāmapati</em>’, ‘<em>senāpati</em>’ and so forth. So that all that the present
text means is that—‘she should no longer remain dependent upon her
husband, she may undertake the work of the toilet-maid or some such
thing, under another man who would give her food’; and when she has
entered into a contract for such service extending over six months, or a
year—if the husband happen to turn up and claim her, asking the employer
to give her up,—he can claim her restitution, before the lapse of the
eight years; as before that she belongs to her husband.</p>
<p>Other matters relating to this subject have been fully dealt with under
Discourse V.</p>
<p>This same view has been accepted by many others also.</p>
<p>Other people, however, hold that the text sanctions recourse to the life
of the ‘remarried widow’ (after the lapse of the time mentioned). If a
woman is abandoned by her husband,—or if her husband, after having made
provision for her, does not return during the said time, and she is as
good as abandoned by him,—‘then, she may he married by another man,
according to the practice of ‘widow remarriage’; and if the former
husband happen to return after that, he can say nothing, and she shall
continue to be the wife of the second husband.</p>
<p>This however is not right; since ‘neither by sale nor by repudiation is
the wife released from her husband.’ (Manu 9.46); and the uses of this
text we shall explain later on.</p>
<p>‘<em>For a sacred duty</em>’— The compound ‘<em>dharmakāryam</em>’ being explained as
a <em>karmadhāraya</em>—‘<em>dharma</em>’—‘sacred’—‘<em>kārya</em>’—duty; and that which is
for purposes of this is ‘<em>dharmakāryārtham</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Objection</em>—“For the house-holder, wherefore should there he any
protracted journey abroad <em>for a sacred duty</em>? It is incumbent upon him
to attend upon the Fires, to perform the</p>
<p>Five Sacrifices. How too can he remain away during the spring season?
Since he has got to perform the <em>Jyotiṣ</em> -sacrifice during the spring.
Even such acts as bathing in sacred places and the like, which are
enjoined by <em>Smṛti</em> texts, have to be performed by him only so long as
they are compatible with those laid down by <em>Śruti</em> texts. These could
not be possible even for one who has gone abroad after having made
arrangements for the maintenance of the fires and other such <em>Śrauta</em>
rites. Since it has been laid down that ‘journeys, after proper
arrangements during absence, are permissible only till the next New or
Full Moon’; and it has also been declared that ‘on the New or Full Moon
Day the man shall pour the libations <em>himself</em>.’ Even for one who has
not laid the Fires, if pilgrimages were undertaken,—even though these
and the performance of the Five Sacrifices would stand upon the same
footing, both being laid down by <em>Smṛti</em> texts,—yet as both the acts are
laid down as to be done by him along with his wife, there should be no
pilgrimage if the wife were left behind.”</p>
<p>Our answer to the above is as follows:—What is said here refers to the
commands of one’s elders;—‘<em>i.e</em>., to the case where the man is sent out
by his elders, either for acquiring merit, a for attendance upon the
king, or on some business of their own,—this going abroad would be
‘<em>for</em> <em>a sacred duty</em>.’ Or, it may refer to the performance of such
Expiatory Rites as consist in wandering about hermitages and such
places. Or, ‘<em>for</em> <em>satred duty</em>’ may stand for the <em>acquiring of
wealth</em>,—the man being poor and seeking to earn wealth by some means.
‘Or <em>for the sake of learning</em>.’—</p>
<p>Objection—“But the taking of a wife is possible only.after one has taken
the Final Bath, which is possible only for one who has completed his
studies and already acquired learning; wherefore then could there be any
possibility for a married man to seek for <em>learning</em>?”</p>
<p>It has been already explained that even after learning a little of what
is contained in the Veda, a man becomes entitled to marry, and also to
the Final Bath and other Ceremonies.</p>
<p>“This cannot be right; there is Final Bath only after the ‘enquiry into
Dharma’ has been completed; and ‘enquiry’ consists in “coming to a
definite conclusion after due consideration and clearing of doubts.”</p>
<p>True; but the present text does not contain the injunction that ‘one
should seek for learning.’ If it were so, then it would be already
included under the ‘purpose of sacred duty’. Then again, even though the
man may have acquired sufficient learning to entitle him to Bath and
Marriage, yet it would be open to him to seek for further proficiency
and practice, specially in the new sciences.</p>
<p>Journey is said to be ‘for fame’, when one goes abroad for advertising
his bravery or learning.</p>
<p>‘<em>For pleasure</em>’,—for instance, when one follows a prostitute; or goes
about seeking for a more desirable wife.</p>
<p>Another <em>Smṛti</em> text lays down the period of time in reference to the
children born:—Says <em>Viṣṇu</em>—‘The Brāhmaṇa shall wait till eight children
are born, the Kṣatriya six and the Vaiśya four.’</p>
<p>There is no time-limit in the case of <em>Śūdras</em>. But some people declare
the limit in their case to be <em>one</em> <em>year</em>.—(76)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda hold that after the expiration of the
terms mentioned, the wife shall go to seek her husband. Nandana
says—‘the meaning is that no sin is committed if she afterwards takes
another husband’.—Medhātithi, having noted and dismissed two other
explanations—(a) that ‘she should maintain herself by blameless methods’
[which is the explanation attributed to Medhātithi himself by Buhler],
and (b) that ‘she may have intercourse with another man*,—propounds the
explanation that ‘she may take service under another man as a
toilet-woman in his house, and on the return of her husband, she may
return to him, if he can induce her to go.’ He also notes and rejects
the explanation of the ‘ancients’ that ‘she may <em>marry</em> another man.’</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (12.98-101).—‘Eight years shall a Brāhmaṇa woman wait for the
return of her absent husband; or four years, if she has no issue; after
that she may betake herself to another man. A Kṣatriya woman shall wait
six years; or three years if she has no issue; a Vaiśya woman, for three
years if she has issue; otherwise, two years. No definite period is
prescribed for a Śūdra woman, whose husband has gone on a journey. Twice
the above periods is ordained for eases where the absent husband is
alive and tidings are received of him. The above rules have been laid
down for those cases where a man has disappeared. No offence is imputed
to a woman if she goes to live with another man after the fixed period
has elapsed.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (18.15-17).—‘A wife must wait for six years, if her husband
has disappeared. If he is heard of, she shall go to him. But if the
husband has become a Renunciate, his wife must refrain from intercourse
with men. The wife of a Brāhmaṇa who has gone abroad for study must wait
for twelve years.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.75-80).—‘The wife of an emigrant shall wait for live
years. After five years have passed, she may go out to seek her husband.
If, for reasons connected with spiritual or pecuniary matters, she be
unwilling to leave her home, she must behave in the same manner as if
her husband were dead. In this manner a Brāhmaṇa woman with issue shall
wait five years, and one having no issue, four years; a Kṣatriya woman
with issue, five years, and one without issue, three years; a Vaiśya
woman with issue, five years, and one without issue, two years; a Śūdra
woman with issue, three years and one without issue, one year. After
that, she shall live among those who are united with her husband, in
interest, or by birth, or by the funeral cake, or by water-libations, or
by descent from the same family,—each earlier named person being more
venerable than the following one. But while any member of the family is
living, she shall never go to a stranger.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Hating</em>’—she who hates her husband.</p>
<p>The meaning of the verse is that he shall not turn her out of the house.
Though the use of the root ‘<em>vas</em>’ with ‘<em>sam</em>’ is not compatible with
the Accusative ending in ‘<em>enam</em>’; and ‘<em>samvaset</em>’, ‘co-habit’, would
stand for ‘<em>samvāsayet</em>’, ‘allowed to live with him yet it should be
taken to mean ‘chiding’. Even in the case of grievious sins, the woman
is not to be turned away, since it has been laid down that ‘she is to be
kept imprisoned in one room’; similarly, in the case of expiatory rites
in connection with such sins. The confiscation of her property also is
for the purpose of bringing her to her senses; and it does not mean
absolute taking away of all her belongings.—(77)</p>

<p><em>Nārada</em> (12.92-95).—‘The woman who wastes the entire property of her
husband under the pretence that it is her own <em>strīdhana</em>, or who
procures abortion, or who makes an attempt on her husband’s life,—the
King shall banish her from the town. One who always shows malice to him,
or makes unkind speeches, or eats before her husband,—he shall expel
from his house. Let not a husband show love to a barren woman, or to one
who gives birth to female children only, or whoso conduct is
reprehensible, or who constantly contradicts him; if he does love
conjugal intercourse with her, he becomes liable to censure himself. If
a man forsakes a wife who is obedient, sweet-spoken, skilful, virtuous
and the mother of male issue,—the King shall make him mindful of his
duty by inflicting severe punishment.’</p>

<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (Aparārka, p. 100).—‘So long as one’s wife is endowed with
virtue and offspring, one shall not take to another wife; if she be
wanting in either of the two, he shall take to another.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (2.4-516).—‘Let him abandon a barren wife in the tenth
year; one who bears daughters only, in the twelfth; one whose children
all die, in the fifteenth; but her who is quarelsome, without delay.’</p>
<p>Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 425).—‘If she does not attend upon him, or is
barren or inimical to her husband,—such a wife the wise men always
abandon; as also one who talks hurriedly and harshly.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 423).—‘He who forsakes a faultless wife
should be punished like a thief.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Do.).—‘There is no expiation for the man who forsakes his
wife, through folly and unjustly, and thereby abandons his duty and also
progeny; hut he may abandon her if she is leprous or outcast or barren,
or insane or with menstruation disorganised, or inimical towards
himself.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (Do.).—‘One who is averse to sexual intercourse, or to
pilgrimage, or to the performance of her duties, or who has intercourse
with a disciple or an elder,—these four kinds of wife should he
abandoned; specially one who is prone to injure her husband.’</p>
<p><em>Hārīta</em> (Do.).—‘He shall avoid a wife who destroys her embryo, has
intercourse with lower castes, or with his disciples and sons, or is
addicted to vicious habits, or is in the habit of wasting money
and-grains.’</p>
<p>Do. (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 873).—‘The childless wife should be
abandoned in the ninth year; one who loses her children, in the tenth
year; one who gives birth to daughters only, during the eleventh year;
and one of harsh words, immediately.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 872),—‘One shall supersede
a wife who is habitually unpleasant or inimical towards men, or
disagreeable.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Do.).—‘If a wife gives birth to too many children, the husband
shall wait for eight years; if she is barren and otherwise defective,
ten years; if she gives birth to daughters only, for twelve years,—and
then, desirous of male issue, he shall take another wife in the lawful
manner.’</p>
<p><em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> (Parāśaramādhava—Ācara, p. 508).—‘If the wife is one that
puts obstacles in the way of the performance of religious acts, or is
unchaste, or is very much diseased,—the husband shall abandon her, for
the; preservation of his righteousness;—if she is harsh of speech, he
shall not abandon her, but supersede her; nor shall he give up having
intercourse with her.’</p>
<p><em>Dakṣa</em> (Aparārka, p. 113).—‘If the first wife, who is the
<em>wife-in-law</em>, becomes faulty, then alone he shall take another wife
with better qualities.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Drunkard</em>’—addicted to drinking wine; and hence incapable of looking
after cooking, and other household work. Such a woman deserves
“supersession.” If she persists in drinking, even after she has been
forbidden by her elders, she shall undergo the punishment laid down
later on, in verse 84. For the sin of transgressing what she ought to
observe, she should perform an expiatory rite; but on repetition, she
shall be superseded.</p>
<p>Other grounds for supersession have been laid down as hampering the due
fulfilment of religious rites, begetting of children and other household
duties.</p>
<p>In the case of the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> woman, for whom wine-drinking has been
forbidden by the scriptures, there is to be expiation of the sin of
drinking, if the act is not repeated. She does not become an outcast,
since the grounds for women being outcasts have been
enumerated—‘abortion, and service of low-born men are the grounds for
women becoming outcasts’—(says Gautama, 21.9.) All this we shall explain
under Discourse XI; it has been dealt with under Discourse V also.</p>
<p>‘<em>False in Conduct</em>’—whose conduct is not good; for instance, whose
treatment of servants is harsh, who takes her food even before the
religious offerings have been made, who has no faith in rites in honour
of gods and <em>pitṛs</em>, or in the feeding of Brāhmṇnas and such religious
acts.</p>
<p>‘<em>Wasteful</em>’—who is a spendthrift, and does not take proper care of her
utensils and furniture, and buys them at high prices and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Mischievous</em>’—who is inclined to inflict punishments for very small
offences (?), and who is prone to interfere with ordinary daily
expenditure (?).</p>
<p>‘<em>Supersession</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., marrying of a wife over and above the said
one.—(80)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 508), which
explains ‘<em>vyādhitā</em>’ as ‘suffering from a long lingering disease—in
<em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 188), which adds the following notes:—‘<em>Madyapā</em>’,
the woman who is addicted to drinking what is forbidden for the caste to
which she belongs,—‘<em>asatyavṛttā</em>,’ whose conduct is not
good,—‘<em>pratikūlā</em>,’ in the habit of doing tilings disagreeable to her
husband and of beating her children, servants and others,—‘<em>arthaghnī</em>,’
prone, through idleness, to wasting money,—‘<em>adhivedana</em>’ means the
taking of another wife.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 100), which adds the note that
‘<em>vyādhitā</em>’ means suffering from a lingering disease;—it quotes this
verse in support of the view that what is meant to be a ground for
superseding the wife is not the drinking of <em>liquor</em>, but the drinking
of any intoxicant; the drinking of wine being one of the ‘serious’ sins,
it would make the woman liable to be renounced, and not only superseded.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 871), whieh adds that
‘<em>Madyapā</em>’ here has been held by older writers to refer only to women
of the twice-born castes; but in reality it refers to all the four
castes, for all of whom the drinking of all the three kinds of
‘wine’—<em>Gauḍī</em>, <em>Mādhvī</em> and <em>Paiṣṭī</em>—is forbidden;—‘<em>asatyavṛttā</em>’ is
ill-behaved or untruthful;—‘<em>pratikūlā</em>,’ acting in ways injurious to
her husband;—‘<em>vyādhitā</em>,’ suffering from such diseases as render her
unfit for household work;—‘<em>hiṃsrā</em>’, addicted to beating children and
maidservants;—‘<em>arthaghnī</em>’, ‘prone to wasting the wealth
acquired;’—‘<em>sarvadā</em>’ is to be construed as qualifying ‘<em>asatyavṛttā</em>’
and the other epithets,—the meaning being the wife who is <em>always</em>
untruthful.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 592), which explains
‘<em>vyādhitā</em>’ as a ‘confirmed invalid.’</p>

<p>The text proceeds to lay down the supersession of other kinds of wives.</p>
<p>Among these, the barren one should be superseded in the eighth year; in
the tenth, she whose children die off.</p>
<p>By marrying a second wife the man shall save himself from the
contingency of disobeying the injunction regarding the Laying of Fire
(to which a childless person is not entitled), and that regarding the
begetting of children,—to which he would be liable by reason of his wife
being childless. Because, the Laying of Fire is not found to be
prescribed for a sonless person.</p>
<p>The same holds good regarding the wife that bears only daughters; as
also she whose children die off.</p>
<p>As regards the wife who is harsh of speech, as there is no such serious
defect, there need be no supersession; and she may be forgiven.—(81)</p>

<p>‘<em>Will-disposed</em>’—towards her husband; devoted to his service.</p>
<p>The present verse enjoins—(a) that her consent is to be obtained, and
(b) that she shall not be disgraced. This applies also to the case of
the barren wife, and to that of one who bears only daughters; because,
all these have been mentioned in the same context; and in none of these
is there any reason why she should be disgraced.</p>
<p>‘<em>In no cane</em>’—never.</p>
<p>‘<em>Disgraced</em>’—in the form of harsh words addressed in admonition.—(82)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 100), which adds that the
qualification ‘<em>sick</em>’ includes also the ‘barren’ wife, and ‘one who
gives birth <em>to</em> female children only’;—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p.
508), as laying down a special consideration in the case of the devoted
wife;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 872) which adds that ‘<em>hitā</em>’
is mentioned only by way of illustration.</p>

<p>For the wife going off in anger, caused by the super-session,—the
present text lays down two optional alternatives in the shape of
<em>confinement</em> or <em>divorce</em>. It would not be right in such a case for
either the mother-in-law or the father-in-law and other relations to
console her and appease her anger by means of presents of food and
clothing, or by sweet words, eta</p>
<p>‘Confinement’ consists in placing her in the charge of guards.</p>
<p>‘<em>Divorce</em>’, ‘<em>Casting off</em>’, has already been explained as consisting
in dropping intercourse with her, and avoiding her bed.</p>
<p>‘<em>Family</em>’—Relations, on the woman’s father’s side, as also those of the
husband’s own side.—(83)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>‘<em>Kula</em>’—‘His own relations as well as the wife’s parental relations’
(Medhātithi);—‘either the family members or the public, according to
circumstances’ (Rāghavānanda).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 69), which adds
that ‘casting off’ means ‘sending her to her father’;—in
<em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Prāyaścitta, p. 288), which explains ‘<em>tyājyā</em>’ as
‘left among her own paternal relations, till such time as she is free
from her defects’;—in <em>Vidhānapārijāta</em> (II, p. 59);—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p.
101), which explains ‘<em>kulasannidhau</em>’ as ‘<em>pitrādikulasannidhau</em>’, in
the presence of her father and other members of the family;—in
<em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 230);—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 874), which

<p>The fine here prescribed is for the woman belonging to the <em>Kṣatriya</em>
and other lower castes; and not for the</p>
<p>Brāhmaṇa woman, who cannot be let off by the small fine here prescribed;
in her case the fine shall be a heavy one. Further, there is no chance
of the latter partaking of wine at festivals. It is only the former
class of women for whom wine-drinking is not entirely prohibited, who
are found to give themselves to much drinking, when they come together
on festive occasions; and it is in view of this that they are forbidden.</p>
<p>This fine is to be inflicted by the husband. Even though the inflicting
of punishments in the duty of the king, yet, inasmuch as the husband is
the ‘lord’ of his wife, he is regarded as competent to inflict the fine;
specially as it is found that people are considered free to inflict
fines upon servants and other dependents, in certain cases.</p>
<p>‘<em>Festivals</em>’—rejoicings in connection with the birth of a son,
marriages and the like.</p>
<p>‘<em>Shows</em>’—theatrical and other spetacles (spectacles?).</p>

several wives of the same caste, the younger one shall not be employed
in religious acts, except along with the eldest.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 420).—‘If a man has several wives, he
should have his religious acts, such as the tending of the Sacrificial
Fire, done by one who belongs to the same caste as himself; if there are
several of the same caste as himself, then by the eldest among them, if
she is not defective; or by one who has given birth to a heroic son and

<p>‘<em>Utkṛṣṭāyci-abhirupāya</em>.’—The first term qualifies the second; and the
meaning is ‘who is of exceptionally distinguished appearance.’—Or, the
two terms may be taken as two distinct qualifications—‘<em>utkṛṣṭāya</em>’
meaning ‘one whose caste and other qualifications are remarkable,’ and
‘<em>abhirūpāya</em>’ meaning ‘handsome’;—the literal signification of the term
being ‘<em>rūpam ābhimukhyena prāptaḥ</em>,’ ‘who has acquired a good
appearance.’—Or, ‘<em>abhirūpāya</em>’ may mean <em>well-disposed</em>; it is in this
sense that a learned man also is called ‘<em>abhirūpa</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Equal</em>’—in caste and other matters.</p>
<p>‘<em>Bridegroom</em>’—one who marries; the son-in-law.</p>
<p>‘<em>She who has not attained</em>’;—<em>i.e</em>., who has no carnal desires aroused,
who is still too young, not having reached the youthful age,—called
‘<em>nagnikā</em>’ in another <em>Smṛti-text</em>; <em>i.e</em>., one in whom the sexual
instinct has not arisen, who is only eight or six years old,—but not a
mere <em>infant</em>; as is indicated by the qualifications (elsewhere)—‘one
who is eight years old.’ This same qualification may also be indicative
of the fact that marriage is meant to be conducive to spiritual merit If
mere Lust were the sole inducement to Marriage, wherefore could there be
any marriage of the girl ‘<em>who has not attained her age</em>’?</p>
<p>There is no force however in this; as people are found to many very
young girls with a view to her dowry. And it has been fully explained
under Discourse III that all forms of activity are not in accordance
with what is laid down in the scriptures.—(88)</p>

<p>‘<em>Aprāptām</em>’—‘Who has not attained the marriageable age,’ (Medhātithi
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who has not attained eight years of age’ (Kullūka
and Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 481), which
explains ‘<em>aprāptām</em>’ as ‘one whose marriage time has not arrived, <em>i</em>.
<em>e</em>., who is still a child’;—in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (II, p. 124), which
explains ‘<em>aprāptām</em>’ as ‘one who has not attained the age that is most
commended for marriage’;—in <em>Vīramitrodya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 755), which
reproduces the explanation of ‘<em>aprāptām</em>’ given in
<em>Parāśaramādhava</em>;—in <em>Smṛtikaumudī</em> (p. 39), as countenancing the
marrying of a girl even before she is of the proper age;—in
<em>Śuddhikaumudī</em> (p. 30) to the same effect;—and in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p.
103), which explains ‘<em>aprāptām</em>’ as ‘one who has not attained the right
age,’ who may be given away in consideration of the special
qualifications of the bridegroom.</p>

<p><em>Gautama</em> (18-21).—‘A girl should be given in marriage before puberty.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.70).—‘Out of fear of the appearance of the menses, let
the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if
she stays in the home after the age of puberty, sin falls on the
father.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (4. 1.11).—‘Let him give his daughter, while she still goes
about naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who
possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities;
let him not keep the maiden in his house after she has reached the age
of puberty.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 754).—‘Family, character, beautiful
body, age, learning, wealth, presence of guardians,—these seven
qualifications should he sought for before a girl is given away; nothing
else need he considered.’</p>
<p><em>Lalla</em> (Do.).—‘Caste, learning, age, character, health, large family,
wealth, Brahmanic character,—these eight should he the qualities of the
Bridegroom.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (Do.).—‘One should give away his daughter to a man who is
endowed with learning, character, relations and good conduct.’</p>
<p><em>Śātātapa</em> (Do., p. 755).—‘That bridegroom should he selected who is
seeking for a wife and is endowed with good family and character,
handsome, learned, intelligent and young, and free from defects.’</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 93), which adds that what is
meant is that ‘so long as a man with good qualifications is not
available she shall not be given to one devoid of qualifications,’ and
not that there is nothing wrong, under the circumstances, to keep the
girl unmarried even after puberty; as this latter view is contrary to
other texts.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> (II, p. 124), which adds that all that is
meant is that the girl should not be given to a man devoid of
qualifications;—in <em>Smṛtikaumudī</em> (p. 38);—in <em>Hemādri</em> (Kāla, p. 804),
which says that what is meant is that ‘she should not be given to a man
without qualifications when a qualified man is available,’ and it is not
meant that a girl should never be given to a man without
qualifications;—in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 216), which has the
same note;—in <em>Saṃskāraratnamāla</em> (p. 456), which also has the same
note;—and in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 102), which says that ‘<em>api</em>’ and
‘<em>kāmam</em>’ indicate that the verse is not to be taken in its literal
sense; all that is meant is to eulogise the marrying of the girl to a
qualified man.</p>

<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (4.10.14).—‘Three years let a marriageable damsel wait for
the order of her father. But after that time, let her choose for
herself, in the fourth year, a husband of the same caste. If no one of
equal rank is to be found, she may take even one destitute of good
qualities.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (18-20).—‘A marriageable maiden who is not given in marriage
shall allow three monthly periods to pass, and afterwards unite herself,
of her own will, to a blameless man, giving up the ornaments received

<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (24.40).—‘When she has allowed three monthly periods to pass
without being married, let her choose a husband for herself; three
monthly periods having passed, she has, in every case, full power to
dispose of herself as she thinks best.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (1.64).—‘If there are no persons to give her away, the

<p><em>Nārada</em> (12.22-23).—‘If no such person be in existence as should marry
her, let the maiden approach the King, and let her, with his permission,
betake herself to a bridegroom of her own choice, who belongs to her own
caste, and is a suitable match in point of descent, morality, age and
sacred learning. Let her discharge her religious duties in common with
him, and bear children to him.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 773).—‘If, for twelve years, the girl

<p>This prohibits the payment of nuptial fees in the case of the girl who
has reached puberty, and who is intended to be given away for a fee; and
the reason for this is that—‘<em>he would fall off from his ownership</em>.’ It
is only during <em>childhood</em> that the girl is to live under the tutilage
of her father; so that when she is taken away by a man after she has
reached a higher age,—the father’s ownership over her has ceased.</p>
<p>Even in the case of a girl who is not intended to be given away for a
fee, the father’s ownership ceases,—the grounds for such cessation
(<em>i.e</em>., the girl having reached the higher age) being equally present
in her ease also.</p>
<p>‘<em>Falling off</em>’ means <em>cessation</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Thwarting</em>’—impeding its fruition in the shape of bearing children.</p>
<p>Some people say that this verse does not belong to Manu.—(93)</p>

<p>What the injunction means is that the maiden married should be so much
younger than the man;—and not that marriage must be done only at. the
age stated. Nor is any stress meant to be laid upon the exact number of
years mentioned; all that is meant is that one should many a girl <em>very
much younger</em> than himself.</p>
<p>This injunction does not occur in the section dealing with Marriage;
hence, what is stated here cannot he regarded as a qualification of the
persons undergoing that sacrament, and consequently, as an essential
factor in the rite itself; for this same reason, it cannot be taken as
precluding the age of ‘ten’ or ‘twenty-five’ or such others.</p>
<p>“But it is often found that even though laid down in a distinct passage,
a detail does form an essential factor of an act”</p>
<p>True; but the very fact that the teacher has thought it fit to place the
present text apart from the section on marriage is clearly indicative of
the fact that he had some special purpose in this.</p>
<p>The practice of cultured men is also as we have stated.</p>
<p>Further, the age here stated can never be observed in the case of one’s
son marrying a second time; so that, if the injunction were meant to be
taken literally, it would mean that there should be no second marriage;
and this would be absurd.—(94)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 766), which says
that the following is the upshot of the texts bearing on this
subject:—If the age of the girl is 8 years or less, she should be
married to a man whose age is three times that of hers; if it is between
8 and 12, the age of the bidegroom should two and a half times;—if her
age is between 12 and 16 then that of the bridegroom shall be two years
less than the double of her age. Of the sentence ‘<em>dharme sīdati
satvaraḥ</em>,’ it gives two explanations:—(<em>a</em>) if he finds that his
religious duties would otherwise suffer, he may marry earlier; and (<em>b</em>)
if he marries in haste,—<em>i.e</em>., if he marries before he has reached the
prescribed age, or if he marries a girl whose age is lower than the one
prescribed,—then he suffers in spiritual merit</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Ācāra, p. 474), as laying down the
extent to which the bride should be younger than the bridegroom;—in
<em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Prāyaścitta, p. 121), which adds that this verse
applies to cases where the girl has not menstruated upto 12 years;—in
<em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 215);—in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 82), which explains
‘<em>tryaṣṭavarṣaḥ</em>’ as ‘twenty-four years old’;—in <em>Hemādri</em> (Kāla, p.
801);—in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 112), which explains ‘<em>satvara</em>’
as ‘one of lower age,’ and deduces the conclusion that there is nothing
wrong if the girl is married before her menstruation;—and in
<em>Gadādharapaddhati</em> (Kāla, p. 222), which explains ‘<em>satvaraḥ</em>’ as one
who is in a hurry to enter the Householder’s stage.’</p>

<p>What the verse means is that ‘the faithful wife should not be abandoned,
even though she suffer from the defects of being disagreeable or of
harsh speech and so forth’; and the rest of it is merely commendatory.</p>
<p>As for the rule that ‘he shall keep her confined in one room,’ which has
been laid down in regard to the unfaithful wife,—this applies to a case
where there has been a single act of transgression on her part; if the
act is repeated, divorce must follow. Otherwise, there would be no point
in the assertion that ‘he shall always support the <em>faithful</em> wife.’</p>
<p>As regards the declaration—‘when a woman has trans gressed, she shall
have all her rights withdrawn, he dressed in dirty clothes and be given
mere subsistence, being allowed to live in a degraded condition, lying
upon the ground’ (<em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 170),—this refers to a case where the
husband is willing and able to keep her; if however he is unwilling,
then there must be divorce.</p>
<p>It is going to be laid down later on that food and clothing should be
provided for oven such wives as have become outcasts, and so forth; but
that has to be taken only as prohibiting <em>banishment</em> which would be
involved in the starting of a life of living on alms, which forms part
of the expiatory rite consequent upon such heinous sins as the murdering
of a Brāhmaṇa and the like. This we shall explain later on. In any case,
it is not incumbent upon the husband to support a wife who has turned
unfaithful. Nor does the present text prescribe ‘casting off’ which
might be interpreted as ‘avoiding intercourse with her.’</p>
<p>That the wife is a ‘present from the gods’ is implied by such Vedic
texts and declamatory passages as—^(‘)Soma gave her to Gandharva etc.,’
(<em>Ṛgveda</em>, 10.85.41).</p>
<p>Or, she may be called ‘a present from the gods’ in the sense that during
the marriage-rite itself, the girl becomes the wife of the gods.</p>
<p>‘<em>Obtains,—not by his own, wish</em>.’ So that the wife does not stand on
the same footing as cattle or gold picked up in the market. This is what
is meant by the phrase ‘<em>not by his own wish</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>What is agreeable to the gods</em>.’—When one divorces his wife, who is a
necessary factor in the offering of libations to the Viśvedevas, he is
not in a position to do ‘what is agreeable to the gods.’ Hence, even
though she be hostile, she has to be supported. But in the event of her
becoming an outcast, and hence losing her rights, the husband may
‘supersede’ her.—(95)</p>

<p>What is to be done when the fee is received voluntarily, has been laid
down in the preceding verse. Hence some people might come to entertain
the following notion—“There is nothing wrong in receiving the nuptial
fee, since the scriptures have laid down special rules regarding the
subject.” And with a view to preclude such a notion, the text
says—‘<em>even a Śūdra should not take a nuptial fee</em>.’—What the foregoing
text has done is to lay down certain rules relating to cases where a man
receives the fee, of his own will; and it does not lay down the
propriety of receiving the fee. Just as the laying down of expiatory
rites in connection with wine-drinking does not mean that the drinking
is permitted.</p>
<p>The ‘nuptial fee’ here spoken of is the same as what has been deprecated
in another text; and we have already explained why the same fact has
been reiterated in the present verse.’—(98)</p>

<p>‘<em>Fidelity</em>’—unstinted obedience in all actions. Says Āpastamba: (<em>a</em>)
‘The wife should not be neglected in matters relating to Duties, Wealth
and Pleasure’;—(<em>b</em>) ‘The highest good of man consists in Duty, Wealth
and Pleasure, as it is declared that the whole <em>fabric</em> rests upon these
three factors.’</p>
<p>Some people hold the following view:—“What is meant by ‘<em>fidelity</em>’ here
is <em>non-abandonment</em>; otherwise, as to the woman, so to the man also, it
would not he open to many more than one wife.”</p>
<p>This however is not right; because in regard to men there is a distinct
sanction—(a) ‘Those who act through mere lust, etc.,’ (b) ‘the barren
wife shall be superseded in the eighth year,’ and so forth; while there
is no such sanction in the case of women. There is another text also
which is indicative of the same fact—‘There are several wives for one
man, but not several husbands for a woman at the same time.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Until death</em>,’—till they die; <em>i.e</em>., it ends only when either of them
dies.</p>
<p>This should be understood to be the highest duty of man and wife, stated
in brief.—(101)</p>

<p>“The father’s estate is to be divided after the father’s death, and the
mother’s estate after the mother’s death’ (Kullūka Rāghavānanda,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).—‘The mother’s estate devolves on the sons, only
on failure of daughters’. (Nārāyaṇa).—The word ‘<em>ūrdhvam</em>’ indicates by
implication that the rule holds good in the case of the father’s turning
an ascetic (Rāghavānanda).—The equal division takes place if the eldest
does not desire to receive an additional share (Kullūka).—The last
clause shows that division of the property may take place with the
parents’ permission during their lifetime. (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda).”—Buhler.</p>
<p>Of the Bhāṣya on this verse we have a single short sentence; on the next
verse it is wanting in all the Mss. hitherto found; so also on several
other important verses bearing on inheritance. It seems it has been
purposely destroyed by the ‘Editors’ who reconstructed the Bhāṣya under
King Madana. And from the fact that the pruning knife began to operate
with the verse dealing with the rule regarding the larger share of the
eldest brother, one feels justified in assuming that the conclusion
arrived at on this point by Medhātithi was detrimental to the interests
of the said King, who therefore set himself systematically to collecting
all available Mss. of the work and destroying this portion.—In the
absence of some such strong motive, one fails to see why the King should
have taken all this trouble regarding the ‘reconstruction’ of
Medhātithi’s commentary.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 455), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Samam</em>’, equal, there being no setting aside of the
twentieth part (for the eldest brother).—It might be argued that since
Manu has himself laid down that the twentieth part should be set aside
as the additional share for the eldest brother, when they are dividing
the paternal estate after the father’s death, why should he speak of
‘equal shares’?—But the fact of the matter is that the said additional
share is meant only for those cases where the eldest brother happens to
possess special qualifications.—<em>Udayakara</em> has however explained the
present verse to mean that what of is to be divided into ‘equal’ shares
is only that part of the property which remains after setting aside the
said twentieth part.—Halāyudha and Pārijāta have read ‘<em>saha</em>’ in place
of ‘<em>samam</em>’ and Pārijāta has explained it as ‘among themselves’.—The
term ‘<em>paitṛkam</em>’ is to be expounded as ‘<em>mātā ca pitā ca pitarau, tayoḥ
idam paitṛkam</em>’; so that the ‘mother’s estate’ also becomes included,—so
says Halāyudha.—Though the text uses the term ‘<em>paitṛkam riktham</em>’,
‘father’s estate’, it is meant to include the estate of the grandfather
and other forefathers also; in which latter also the brothers have
shares.—Though it is true that both the father’s and the mother’s estate
are meant, yet it has to be borne in mind that to the mother’s estate,
the sons are entitled only in the absence of a daughter or her
descendants.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 41), which adds that even though
the text repeats the particle ‘<em>ca</em>’, yet it does not mean that <em>both</em>
the parents should die before the property is divided.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p, 326), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Pituḥ ūrdhvam</em>’, this phrase indicates the time for
the division of the <em>father’s</em> property; and ‘<em>mātuḥ ūrdhvam</em>’ indicates
that for the division of the <em>mother’s</em> property; thus the meaning of
the verse comes to this:—On the death of the Father, his estate is to be
partitioned, even though the Mother may be living; similarly on the
death of the Mother, her estate is to be partitioned, even though the
Father may be living; there being no reason why the partition of the
estate of the one should await the death of the other.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 443);—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, p. 124) which has the following notes;—‘<em>Samam</em>’,
equal,—<em>i.e</em>., without setting apart 20 per cent for the eldest;—it
might be argued that Manu has actually sanctioned 20 per cent, as the
special share of the eldest brother, in connection with the partition
that is done after the Father’s death;—but this sanction should be taken
as referring either to cases where the eldest brother has very special
qualifications, or where he is specially desirous of having a special
share;—it explains the mention of the ‘mother’ as being due to the term
‘<em>paitṛkam</em>’ meaning ‘parental’, and hence including the mother’s
property also, which can be partitioned only after the death of the
‘mother.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtisāroddhāra</em> (p. 331);—in <em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em>;—in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra, 170a), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Paitṛkam</em>’, belonging to <em>the Father</em> and <em>the Mother</em>; the
sense being that the Father’s property is to be divided after the
Father’s death, find the Mother’s property after the Mother’s death;—the
particle ‘<em>ca</em>’ does not imply that ‘after the death of both the parents
is another time for partition’; for the simple reason that the Mother or
the Father being alive can be no obstacle in the partitioning of the
property of the other;—and in <em>Jīmūtavāhana</em> (Dāyabhāga, p. 23), which
says that this verse is meant to answer the question ‘why the sons
should not partition the property during the life-time of the
parents’?—the reason being that during that time they have no
proprietary right over it.</p>

sons;—while the father lives, the division of the estate can take place
only with his permission.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (18.36).—‘Sons who are of the same caste as the father shall
receive equal shares.’</p>
<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (2.13.1-3).—‘Sons begotten in the right manner on a wife of
the same caste as oneself have a right to inherit the estate;—if they do
not sin against either of the parents.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.117).—‘After the parents, the sons shall divide equally
their property as well as their debts; the mother’s property, what
remains after the paying off of the debts, her daughters shall divide
among themselves; and in the absence of the daughters, the offspring of
their daughters.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Aparārka, p. 12).—‘Partition is ordained only among those
sons who have attained their majority;—for males, majority is attained
in the sixteenth year.’</p>
<p><em>Śukranīti</em> (4.5.591).—‘If the father he dead, the sons and the rest are
to receive their shares according to the said proportion (<em>i.e</em>., sons
and their mothers are to be made equal sharers).’</p>
<p><em>Arthaśāstra</em> (p. 31).—‘During the life-time of the parents, the sons
have no right over the ancestral property; after the death of the
parents, there is partition of the ancestral property, and also of the
self-acquired property of the father&hellip; There shall be an equal division
of the property and of the debt.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (13.49-50).—‘After their father’s death, the sons shall succeed
to his wealth in order; whenever a superior son is wanting, the one next
to him shall succeed. On failure of a son, the daughter succeeds;
because she continues the lineage just like the son.’</p>
<p>Do. (13.2).—‘The father being dead, the sons shall divide the estate as
they ought,—so shall the daughters divide the property of the mother
when she dies; on failing daughters, their issue.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Aparārka, 718).—‘After the father, the sons shall divide the
property equally.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.1).—‘After the death of both parents, division of the

share alike.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 456).—‘On the father’s death the sons
shall divide among themselves the father’s property; they have no right
over the property so long as the father is alive and is free from
faults.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Do.).—‘During the father’s life time, the sons shall
not divide the property; the sons have no right even over that which may
have been acquired subsequently; because as regards property, as well as
over religious rites, the sons are dependant upon the father, so long as
he is alive and is faultless.’</p>
<p><em>Saṃgrahakāra</em> (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 327).—‘The father’s
property may be divided on his death, even while the mother is living;
as apart from her husband, the wife has no proprietory right; similarly
the mother’s property may be divided on her death, even while the father
is living, as the husband has no right over his wife’s <em>Strīdhana</em> while
her children are there.’</p>

<p>What is said here refers to eases where ‘the eldest son is specially
virtuous’ (Kūlluka and Rāghavānanda),—or ‘possesses eminent qualities,
and the others are less distinguished’ (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (p. 117), where <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> has
the following notes:—‘<em>Pitryam</em>’, inherited from the father,—‘<em>Śeṣāḥ</em>’,
brothers other than the eldest,—<em>Upajī</em> <em>veyuḥ</em>, should follow him, like
their father. <em>Mitākṣarā</em> adds that such unequal division, even though
sanctioned by the scriptures, should never be adopted, being opposed to
popular sentiment, and also to Vedic texts.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Rājanīti, p. 35), in support of the
view that the eldest son should succeed to the kingdom;—in <em>Aparārka</em>
(p. 722), which adds that this rule is meant for eases where the younger
brothers are still in <em>status pupillari</em>, or are not entitled to any
share by reason of being idiots and so forth, or are inexperienced;—and
in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 457), which adds the following notes:—What is
meant is that in partition, the eldest brother, if he happens to be
possessed of all the qualities of the superior brother, should be
treated as the sole master, like the Father himself;—‘<em>tamupajīveyuḥ</em>’
means that ‘they should live on the subsistence provided by him.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, (II, p. 170);—anti in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, p. 125), as laying down an alternative course;—in

<p>The right sort of eldest brother ‘<em>advances the family</em>’; and when the
same is devoid of qualities, he ‘<em>ruins it</em>.’ When the eldest brother
has a good character, his younger brothers also behave in the same
manner. And when not possessed of good qualities, all these quarrel
among themselves.—(109)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Kulam vardhayati</em>’, the prosperity of the family
being brought about by the adopting of proper business-methods and the
taking care of the younger brothers;—‘<em>vināśayati</em>’, all that this means
is that he is in a position to ruin the family;—in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 656);—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>Inasmuch as no man voluntarily incurs any responsibilities regarding the
performance of the <em>Jyotiṣṭoma</em> and other sacrifices, which involves the
spending of wealth,—the text proceeds to recommend ‘separation,’ with a
view to the performance of such acts.—‘<em>Or separately with a view to
spiritual merit</em>’—This does not mean that, non-separation is sinful; all
that is meant is that Separation is meritorious, just like the
<em>Agnihotra</em> and other acts.</p>
<p>“But since non-separation would be an obstacle to the performance of the
meritorious acts, it should he sinful.”</p>
<p>There is no force in this objection. There is sin only when a man omits
to do what it is his duty to do; and one who has not separated from his
brother is not entitled to the performance of the religions acts, for
the simple reason that he has no independent ‘Fire’ of his own; as the
‘Laying of Fire’ has been laid down as to be done at the time of
separation. In the case of the man who has married and laid his Fires
during his father’s life-time, he is at once entitled to the performance
of the religious acts; so that for such a man there is no
‘non-separation.’ But even in this case, if the man happens to lose his
properly, or for some reason does not possess enough wealth to enable
him to perform the religious acts, he would not incur sin, if he lived
with his brothers. Because, as has been already pointed out, neither
‘separation’ by itself, or ‘non-separation’ by itself, is cither
meritorious or sinful.</p>
<p>“It has been declared that ‘for brothers who have not divided their
property a single religious duty is performed,’ which shows that like
husband and wife, the brothers perform their duty conjointly; and this
clearly shows that before separation, their clear duty is that they
should act conjointly, on account of their property being common.”</p>
<p>This cannot be the case with the <em>Agnihotra</em> and similar acts. These are
performed in the ‘<em>Āhavanīya</em>’ and other consecrated fires; and the
existence of these fires is due to certain consecratory rites. Further,
as the injunction relating to these contains the verb with the
<em>Ātmanepada</em> ending, it is clear that the Fires consecrated by one man
cannot be used by another; and further the pouring of oblations in Fires
consecrated by another person is found to be distinctly forbidden—‘one
should not offer sacrifices in Fires belonging to another man.’ Nor is
the performance of the <em>Agnihotra</em> and other rites laid down as to be
done in the household Fire kindled according to <em>Smārta</em> rites, because
the very term ‘household’ connotes a special qualification; and the tin;
thus qualified could be used for certain specified purposes only; such
for instance as the feeding of guests and other acts laid down as
constituting the ‘great sacrifices;’—in such texts as—‘In the marital
fire should one perform his household-rites, as also the five
sacrifices.’ From this it is clear that in the household-fire one can
perform only the <em>household-rites</em>. Consequently when a text says that
‘a single duty is performed,’ it clearly refers to such acts as the
<em>Śrāddha</em>, the Charities and so forth.—(111)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 459), which has the note
that, what is meant is that separation is considered desirable, because
it affords the opportunity for several performances of sacrifices; it is
not meant that the <em>separation</em> itself is conducive to merit, like the
performance of the <em>Jyotiṣṭoma</em>, or that non-separation is sinful, like
the eating of the flesh of the animal killed by a poisoned arrow.</p>
<p>It in quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 719), which adds that conjoint life is
meant for those cases where some of the brothers may be still studying;
in cases where all of them have read the Veda and are capable of taking
the fires, it is far better that they should live separately;—again on
p. 722, to the effect that it is not necessary that the brothers <em>must</em>
divide immediately after the father’s death;—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, p. 125) as sanctioning partition as conducive to religions
merit;—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 172a);—and by <em>Jīmūtavāhāna</em>
(Dāyabhāga, p. 37), which says that this is a clear case of voluntary
option.</p>

<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.4).—‘In partition, there is increase of spiritual merit.’</p>

cook their food together, the Pitṛs, Gods and Brāhmaṇas are worshipped
at a single place; but after they have divided the property, the worship
takes place separately in each house.’</p>
<p><em>Vyāsa</em> (Aparārka, p. 719).—‘It has been ordained that while the parents
are alive, the sons shall live together; when the parents have died, and
the sons become divided, their spiritual merit increases.’</p>

<p>Some people hold the following view—“This rule regarding the <em>additional
portions</em> refers to the past, and is not meant to be observed during the
present time; specially because the rules laid down in the <em>Smṛti</em>
always bear upon some particular time; and when the rule is put forth as
to be observed, the intention of the author is that the knowledge of
this may bring merit to the learner; just as it is in the case of the
Prolonged Sacrificial Sessions. No one is found nowadays to perform
these Prolonged Sacrificial Sessions, and yet <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> texts contain
injunctions of them. It is in view of such acts that it has been
declared that ‘Religious duties for the Kali cycle are different <em>etc.,
etc</em>.’ (l85). Thus religious duties are to be understood as restricted
in regard to time also, just as they are in regard to place. As a matter
of fact, no religious act that has been enjoined is performed in all
places; hence it is that they are declared as restricted in regard to
place. If they were meant to be performed at all places, there would be
no such restrictions as—‘This shall be done by the learned twice-born
persons etc, <em>etc</em>.’ (9.66). From all this it follows that when rules
regarding <em>Additional Portions</em> are put forward, they are not meant to
be observed, their case being analogous to that of <em>Killing the cow</em>
(for the <em>Madhuparka</em> offering).”</p>
<p>This view is not quite satisfactory. No such restriction regarding
<em>time</em> is found laid down anywhere. Restrictions regarding <em>place</em> also
that are found pertain only to ‘the ground sloping towards the east’ and
so forth, and never to the ‘Central’ or ‘Eastern’ or other parts of the
country; as has been made clear under 8.41. As regards the Prolonged
Sacrificial Sessions also, it is quite possible even nowadays to preform
them; specially as it has been already shown that in connection with all
this the term ‘year’ stands for the <em>day</em>. As for no one being found to
perform these nowadays,—even though its performance has been enjoined as
<em>necessary</em>,—that may be due to the fact, either that men are not
possessed of the capacity necessary for their performance, or that they
do not desire the results obtainable from its performance, or that they
do not have sufficient faith. Then, as regards the phrase ‘while Vena
was ruling over his kingdom’ (9.66), which has the appearance of a
restriction regarding <em>time</em>, all that it indicates is that the duties
laid down have been performed from very ancient times; and not that they
are restricted in regard to time.</p>
<p>The ‘twentieth part’ for the eldest; <em>i.e</em>., the twentieth part of the
entire state shall be deducted and given to the eldest brother. Half of
that—<em>i.e</em>., the fortieth part, to the middlemost brother; and to the
youngest brother, the fourth part of that,—<em>i.e</em>., the eightieth part.
When all these shares have been taken out, the remainder is to be
divided into three equal parts.</p>
<p>Further, among all the chattels, that which happens to be the best is to
be given to the eldest brother.</p>
<p>Or, the reading may be ‘<em>dravyeṣvapi param varam</em>,’ which means that
from among all kinds of things—good, bad and indifferent,—the best of
each kind shall be given to the eldest brother. For instance, if there
are cows or horses, the best of these shall be given to
him—absolutely—and not either in lieu of any other article, or in return
for a price.</p>
<p>This rule regarding <em>additional portions</em> is meant only for those cases
where the three brothers are possessed of special qualifications; as it
is only in the case of such men that additional shares are found to be
actually given.—(112)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.114), which notes that this
unequal division pertains to eases where the Father himself is dividing
his <em>self-acquired</em> property among his sons,—no such division being
permissible regarding ancestral property.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 645), which supplies the following
explanation:—The twentieth part of the property going to be divided, as
also the <em>best</em> thing among the articles, should be given to the eldest
brother; to the second brother, the fortieth part of the estate and also
an article of the second quality; and to the youngest brother, the
eightieth part of the estate and a third-rate article; the property that
remains after this is to be divided equally;—it goes on to add that,
though this unequal division has been sanctioned by several texts, yet
it should never be adopted in practice, as it is contrary to popular
sentiment, and what is against popular sentiment should not be done.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 468), along with the next two
verses which adds the following notes.—This deduction of special shares
pertains to cases where the eldest brother is endowed with superior
qualifications;—the law on this point may be thus summed up: In a case
where there are several sons born of the same mother, and every one is
endowed with qualities,—but there is a gradual inferiority in the
qualities,—then the eldest brother should receive as his special share,
the twentieth part out of the whole property, as also the best among the
articles in the property; the second brother is to receive half of that,
<em>i.e</em>., the fortieth part, and also one article of the second quality;
and the youngest brother, the eightieth part, and also an article of the
lowest quality;—when however the eldest and the youngest alone are
possessed of superior qualities, then the said special shares are to be
given to these two only, the second brother receiving only his ordinary
share, the special share prescribed for the <em>qualified</em> second
brother—<em>i.e</em>., the fortieth pari of the property,—being equally divided
among the throe;—in a case where there are several brothers between the
oldest and the youngest, and many of them are possessed of superior
qualities, each one of the middle brothers is to receive a fortieth part
as his special share;—when the eldest brother is possessed of very
superior qualities, while the others are entirely devoid of qualities,
he shall take as his special share the best among the articles,—the best
of every kind of articles, <em>e.g</em>., ruby among the gems and so forth,—and
also one among each kind of cows, buffaloes and other cattle.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 43);—in the <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p.
193);—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 128), which notes on p. 125
that this refers to cases where the elder brother is endowed with
special qualifications, or where he is specially desirous of having the
extra share;—in <em>Smṛtisāroddhāra</em>, (p. 331), which says that this refers
to the property acquired by the father when he divides it among his sons
during his own life-time;—and by <em>Jīmūtavāhana</em> (Dāyabhāga, p. 64), who
says that equal partition is to be made after all these ‘special shares’
have been extracted, as is made clear by verse 116; the special share of
the eldest brother being the twentieth part of the property along with
the ‘best article’.</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>
<p><strong>(verses 9.112-113)</strong></p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.5-8).—‘The additional share of the eldest son consists of
the twentieth part of the estate, a male and a female (of animals with
one row of front teeth), a cart yoked with animals with two rows of
front teeth, and a bull; the additional share of the middlemost consists
of the one-eyed, old, hornless and tailless animals, if there are
several of them; the additional share of the youngest consists of the
sheep, grain, iron-utensils in the house, a house, a cart yoked with
oxen, and one of each kind of the other animals. The remaining property
shall be divided equally.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (2-3.4-5).—‘Or the eldest may receive the most excellent
chattel; for the Veda says “they distinguished the eldest by an
additional share of the property;” or the eldest may receive in excess,
one part out of ten; and the other sons shall receive equal shares. The
additional share of the eldest is a cow, a horse, a goat or a sheep,
respectively among the four castes.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (18.37).—‘A best part shall be given to the eldest as his
additional share.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (12.114).—‘If the father makes the partition, he can
distribute the property among his sons as he pleases; or he shall give
the superior share to the eldest; or he may give equal shares to all.’</p>
<p><em>Arthaśāstra</em> (p. 33).—‘If the father makes the division during his
life-time, he shall not make any difference in favour of any son; nor
shall he disinherit any without reason.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (13.4).—‘Or the father himself may distribute his property
among his sons, when he is stricken in years,—either allotting a larger
share to the eldest son, or in any other way that he chooses.’</p>
<p>Do. (13.13).—‘To the eldest son, a larger share shall be allotted and a
lesser share than that to the youngest, the rest shall take equal
shares; and so shall an unmarried sister.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.7-10).—‘Partition among coparceners is held to be of two
kinds. One is with attention to priority of birth, the other consists of
the allotment of equal shares. All sons of the twice-born, begotten on
wives of the same caste as themselves, shall take equal shares, after
giving a preferential share to the eldest. He who is the first by birth,
by sacred knowledge, or by good qualities, shall take a couple of shares
out of the partible wealth, and the rest shall take equal shares; hut
the former stands to these latter in the relation of father, as it were.
When they divide their father’s heritage, the sons shall share alike;
but he who is distinguished by sacred knowledge and virtue shall obtain
a larger share than the rest.’</p>
<p><em>Hārīta</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 471).—‘When the property is going to be
divided, they shall make over to the eldest a hull from among the cows
and hulls, or some superior article, and the household temple; the
others shall go out of the family-house and build their own houses. If
they do not build separate houses, then the best house shall go the
eldest, the next best to the middlemost, and the next to the youngest.’</p>
<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (2.14.7, 10-15).—‘In some countries, gold, black cattle, or
black produce of the earth (iron) is the share of the eldest. This
preference for the eldest son is forbidden by the scriptures; for it is
declared in the Veda, without making any differentiation among sons,
that “Manu divided his wealth amongst his sons.” The Veda also lends
support to the rule in favour of the eldest son—“They distinguish the
eldest by a larger share of the heritage.” But the answer to this is
that those versed in the science of interpreting the law declare that a
mere statement of facts cannot he a rule.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 472).—‘One should allot the tenth part of
the property as the additional share for the eldest who happens to be
well-behaved.’</p>

<p>The first half of the verse only reiterates what has been said above
regarding the eldest brother taking the be of the chattels.</p>
<p>The terra ‘<em>jāta</em>’ is synonymous with ‘<em>jāti</em>,’ ‘kind’; or it may mean
‘variety.’</p>
<p>‘<em>First-born</em>’—eldest.</p>
<p>‘<em>Best</em>’—most excellent.</p>
<p>‘<em>Anything particularly good</em>;’—such as a piece of cloth or an ornament</p>
<p>‘<em>Best of ten</em>.’—He shall take the best one among the ten. That is, if
there are ten cows or horses, he shall take the best among these. The
term ‘ten’ is used in the sense of a <em>group consisting of ten</em>.</p>
<p>Others explain ‘<em>daśataḥ</em>’ as ending in the ‘<em>tasi</em>’ affix, which has
the reflexive sense, and hence meaning ‘<em>ten</em>’ (not ‘from among ten’);
and according to this they read ‘<em>varān</em>’ in the plural (for ‘<em>varam</em>’);
and the sense in this case is that he should take <em>ten good animals</em>.</p>
<p>Others again declare that the term refers to a particular kind of
animals; those that have single hoofs, for instance (?).—(114)</p>

<p>‘<em>Out of ten</em>’— animals.</p>
<p>‘The additional share,’ mentioned in the preceding verses,—there is to
be none,—when the brothers are all ‘<em>efficient</em>’—particularly
excellent—‘<em>in their occupations</em>’—of learning, study and so forth.</p>
<p>Some people take the term ‘<em>daśasu</em>,’ ‘out of ten,’ as purely
illustrative;—the sense being that there is to be none of the additional
shares that are mentioned in the text which speaks of ‘the best of ten;’
and the reason given for this explanation is that the text lays down
‘efficiency in occupations’ as the ground.</p>
<p>Even in such cases however, the other brothers should give to the eldest
brother ‘<em>some little thing</em>’—some present—as a mark of respect.—(115)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em>, (p. 476), which adds the
following explanation:—The additional share prescribed in the last
quarter of the last verse, ‘the best among them’, is not to be taken if
all the brothers are equal in learning and other qualities. This is only
by way of illustration; it means that none of the additional shares
mentioned in verses 112-114 is to be taken; as is clear from the clause
‘<em>yat kiñcideva deyam syāt</em>’; which means that some little thing is to
be given to the eldest brother, as a mark of respect due to his superior
age. When there is no difference among them on account of qualities,
then ‘Seniority’ among the brothers is to be determined by the portion
of their mothers, the son born of the senior-most wife having been
declared to be the ‘senior.’ That this is the finally adopted view (and
not a mere tentative one) is proved by the fact that both <em>Lakṣmīdhara</em>
and the <em>Pārijāta</em> have accepted the view that ‘the son of the senior
wife, even though younger in age, is to be regarded as senior.’</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The term ‘<em>kanyā</em>’ is, as a rule, used in the sense of the <em>unmarried
girl</em>’, as we find in the case where a son is called ‘<em>kānīna</em>’ (which
means <em>born of a kanyā, i.e</em>., of an unmarried woman). In another
<em>Smṛti</em> text, ‘<em>anūḍhā</em>’ (‘unmarried’) is the actual word used. From
this it is dear that the share here laid down pertains to the unmarried
girl.</p>
<p>‘<em>Of the mine caste</em>.’—Each of the brothers should give to the sister of
the same caste as himself the fourth part of his own share. That is to
say, in a case where the father has left several unmarried girls, the
share allotted <em>to ouch of them should be the</em> fourth part of the
portion of the brother belonging to the same caste as himself.</p>
<p>The upshot therefore comes to be this:—Three <em>parts</em> of the property
shall be taken by the sons and the fourth part by the daughter.</p>
<p>Some people have held the following view:—Three parts of the property
shall be taken by the sons and the fourth part by the daughter.</p>
<p>Others have held the following view:—“Truly a great benefit is derived
by the daughter from her father:</p>
<p>If the father is alive they have their marriage performed at tremendous
expense, and if he is dead, she obtains a share in the property.”</p>
<p>But the same may be said of the son also. Further, why should there be
such objections against what is distinctly laid down by the words of the
text?</p>
<p>If the idea of the objector is that, according to custom, the only
benefit to which the girl is entitled is that her marriage should be
performed,—then our answer is that the direct assertion of the Smṛti is
infinitely more authoritative than custom. As a matter of fact however,
the custom referred to is by no means universal; so that when it is only
limited in scope, the right course is to adopt the course laid down in
the Smṛti text.</p>
<p>Some people have held the view that—“all that need be given to the girl
is what is necessary for her marriage, and not quite the <em>fourth part</em>
as mentioned in the text”</p>
<p>But to such people we address the following remarks:—There is no
restriction upon gifts in connection with marriage, as there is in
connection with the sacrificial fee, which is fixed at¹ twelve hundred.’
The gift in connection with marriage however is not precisely fixed. For
it is said.—‘The father shall marry the girl, clothed and adorned, and
he may also give her a dowry;’ and as ornaments are of various kinds,
made of gold, jewels, pearls, corals and such substances, it cannot be
definitely ascertained how much wealth is to be given on that account,
or what sort of ornament is to be given. So that even for the purpose of
precisely defining what shall be given, it is only right to say that the
brother shall give the fourth part of bis share. Nor does this militate
against either any scriptual injunctions or reason.</p>
<p>This same view is supported by other <em>Smṛti</em> texts also: ‘The brothers
who have already had their sacramental rites performed, should perform
the same for the unmarried girls; and sisters should receive from their
brother’s the fourth part of their shore’ (<em>Yājñavalkya</em> 2. 124); and
again—‘Until marriage has not been performed, she shall received a
share; after marriage she shall be maintained by her husband.’</p>
<p>What this last text means is as follows:—When the property left for the
brother and the sister is small, and the fourth part of the brother’s
share is not sufficient for the sister’s maintenance,—in such a case the
sister shall enjoy a share equal to her brother’s, until her marriage;
after which she shall receive the fourth part of the share, even though
if be small. And in answer to the question as to how that, would
maintain the girl, the answer is that ‘after marriage she shall be
maintained by her husband.’</p>
<p>The term ‘brother’ in the present text has been explained as standing
for the <em>uterine brother</em>. But what is the purpose of adding this
explanation? As a matter of fact, the term ‘brother’ without a prefixed
qualification is always directly applied to the uterine brother. And the
term ‘<em>severally</em>’ in the text is also indicative of the same idea.</p>
<p>But in that case the girl that has no uterine brother would have to go
without a share in the property; nor could there be any chance for any
dowry being provided for her. It might be argued that her step-brother
would provide for her. But in the absence of some other text laying down
(such a gift), he may not give it</p>
<p>As a matter of fact however, the term ‘brother’ is found to be applied
to the sons of the same father and several mothers; and it is only to
cousins, maternal and paternal, that the term is applied figuratively.
If this view is accepted, it saves us from the contingency of
attributing several denotations to the single word ‘brother.’</p>
<p>The rule laid down in other Smṛti-texts also supports the allocation of
shares set forth in the present text. We read there as follows—^(‘)What
remains of the ancestral property, after the father’s debts have been
paid off’, shall be divided; other necessary payments also being made
out of it, such for instance as the gift to the unmarried girls; Here we
do not find the words ‘brother’ and^(‘)sister,’ which might give rise to
the doubt (as to the <em>uterine</em> or other kinds of brother being meant).</p>
<p>As regards the term ‘<em>severally</em>’ (in the text),—it has been added with
a view to guard against the possible interpretation that the fourth part
of the share of a single brother should be divided among all the
sisters.</p>
<p>It might be argued that—“all that this means is that the brothers would
incur sin by not giving out of their shares; and there is nothing to
force them to give it.” Hence it is added—‘<em>Those not inclined to give
would be outcasts</em>.’ A man is spoken of as^(‘)taking’ a thing only when
he is its owner, and no one speaks of such a thing as^(‘)to be <em>given</em>
to him;’ hence it is that no one speaks of the brothers <em>giving</em> to a
brother (both being <em>owners</em>); and whenever the word^(‘)giving’ is used,
it is only when the recipient is not the <em>owner</em> of the property
concerned.—(118)</p>

<p>‘If there are several brothers find only one sister, the former must
deduct from their several shares as much money as will make up the
fourth part of one brother’s share’ (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 731), which adds the following
notes ‘<em>Svebhyoṃśebhyaḥ</em>’ means ‘from out of the share of one brother’;
the plural number is used in view of the plurality of daughters;—‘<em>svāt
svāt</em>’, the repetition is in reference to daughters of diverse
castes;—thus the meaning comes to be as follows:—When a Brāhmaṇa has
wives of all the four castes, and each of these has daughters, then the
daughter born of the Brāhmaṇa wife is to receive the fourth part of the
share accruing to the son of the Brahmaṇa wife; similarly the daughter
of the Kṣatriya wife is to receive the fourth part of the share of the
son of the Kṣatriya wife. This however, is not the sister’s ‘<em>rightful</em>
inheritance’.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.124), which adds the following
explanation:—The Brāhmaṇa-sons should give to the Brāhmaṇa-daughters the
fourth part of the share that accrues to them in accordance with their
castes,—whereby 4 parts go to the Brāhmaṇa, etc. (see verse 153 below);
it does not mean that each brother should give a fourth part out of his
own share; what is meant is that the daughter of a certain caste is to
receive the fourth part of what is prescribed as the share of the son of
that caste;—the last clause ‘<em>patitāḥ syuraditsavaḥ</em>’ indicates the
obligatory character of the rule. For this same reason it is not right
to hold that all that the daughter is to receive is money enough for her
marriage. It goes on to add that the explanation provided by Asahāya and
Medhātitha is the right one. Thus it is decided that after the father’s
death, the daughter is actually <em>entitled</em> to a share.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 494), which adds the following
explanation:—It does not mean that the brother should take out a fourth
part of his own share and give it to his sister; what is meant is that
the daughter of a certaind (certain?) caste is to receive the fourth
part of what is prescribed as the share of the son of that caste; which
thus is to be given to her, for the purpose of her marriage. Thus the
meaning comes to be that out of the ‘four shares’ and the ‘three shares’
to which the sons of the Brāhmaṇa wife and those of the Kṣatriya wife
respectively are entitled,—out of the combined total of these—a ‘fourth
part’ shall be given to the daughter; so that while it is the ‘fourth
part’ that is to be given, the real purpose of this gift is to enable
her marriage to be performed. Such is the view of Viṣṇu, the <em>Kalpataru</em>
and the <em>Mitākṣarā</em>; while Halāyadha holds the opinion that no stress is
meant to be laid on the ‘fourth part’, all that is meant is that the
daughter is to receive what would be needed for the performance of her
marriage. And this is the view that appears to be most proper; for
whatever the ‘fourth part’ may be, the performance of the marriage would
be necessary in any case.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 345), which supplies
the following notes:—The meaning is that the brother belonging to the
Brāhmaṇa and other castes should each give to the sisters of the
Brāhmaṇa and other castes, the fourth part of his own share; that is to
say, (<em>a</em>) in a case where a man has only one wife, and that of the
Brāhmaṇa caste, and from her he has one son and one daughter,—the son
shall divide his father’s property into two parts, and having divided
one of these two parts into four parts, he shall give one of these four
parts to his sister and take the rest for himself;—when there are two
sons and one daughter, the property shall be divided into three parts,
and one of these three parts being divided into four parts, one of these
four parts is to go to the daughter, and the rest the two sons shall
divide between themselves;—when there is one son and two daughters, the
father’s property shall be divided into three parts, and one of these
three parts being divided into four parts, two of these latter parts
shall be given to the two daughters, and the rest shall be taken by the
son.—(<em>b</em>) But in a case where the man has left one son of the Brāhmaṇa
wife and one daughter of the Kṣatriya wife,—the father’s property shall
be divided into <em>seven</em> parts (‘four shares’ accruing to the Brāhmaṇa
son and ‘three shares’ to the Kṣatriya son), if there be one, the ‘three
shares’ (accruing to the Kṣatriya son) shall be divided into four parts,
one of these four parts shall be given to the Kṣatriya daughter, the
rest of the property going to the Brāhmaṇa son; where there are two
Brāhmaṇa sons and one Kṣatriya daughter the father’s property is to be
divided into <em>eleven</em> parts (4 shares for each of the Brāhmaṇa sons and
three for the Kṣatriya if there be one), and the three parts (accruing
to the Kṣatriya son) being divided into four parts, one of these four
parts shall go to the <em>Kṣatriya</em> daughter, and the rest of the property
shall be divided between the two Brāhmaṇa sons. On the same principle is
partition to proceed when there are brothers of different castes or
sisters in varying numbers; such is the explanation provided by
Medhātithi, and approved by Vijñāneśwara also;—Bhāruci on the other hand
holds that the ‘fourth share’ only stands for ‘such amount as may be
necessary for her marriage,’ and that therefore unmarried girls have no
<em>right</em> to the inheritance as such. This same view has been held also by
the author of the <em>Candrikā</em>,—of these two views, people may accept the
one that appears to be the most reasonable.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 36a);—in
<em>Vivādacintāmani</em> (Calcutta, p. 134), which says that the meaning is
that ‘each daughter should receive the fourth part of what forms the
share of a son of the same caste as himself,’ and adds that stress is
not meant to be laid upon the ‘fourth part,’ what is meant is that so
much should be given to her as would suffice for her marriage;—and in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra, 179b), which says that this does <em>not</em> mean
that ‘in the case of either form of partition among the brothers, each
brother should give to the sister a fourth part of his share’; as, if
there were so, if there are several brothers to a single sister, she
would have a very large property,—or if there were a single brother to
many sisters, he would have nothing left for himself;—all therefore that
is meant is that the brother should give to the sisters just enough to
suffice for her marriage—so says the Vivādaratnākara, the
Vivādacintāmaṇi and the rest;—this is not right; as the text is clear on
the point that by not giving to the sister the fourth part of his share,
the brother incurs a sin which is quite different from that incurred in
not providing for her marriage; the right explanation is that which has
been provided by Medhātithi and the Mitākṣarā. (It then proceeds to
quote these).</p>
<p>It is quoted by <em>Jīmūtavāhana</em> (Dāyabhāga, p. 114), which says that the
root ‘<em>dā</em>’ used makes it clear that the sisters have no <em>claims</em> over
the property.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitālṣarā</em> (2. 119), to the effect that of the
animals mentioned, if an odd one remains after partition, it is to be
given to the qldest brother;—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 686), to the same
effect;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 723), which explains ‘<em>viṣamam</em>’ as a number
different from (not a multiple of) the number of brothers;—in

<p>The ‘<em>Secondary</em> ’— subsidiary <em>i.e</em>., the ‘<em>kṣetraja</em>’ son;—‘<em>to the
primary</em>’—to the legitimate, ‘body-born,’ ‘<em>aurasa</em>’ son,—‘<em>cannot he
equal</em>’—this has got to be supplied,—‘<em>rightly</em>,’ according to law.
Hence this cannot be right. That is, it is only the ‘<em>legitimate</em>’ son
of the elder brother who is entitled to the ‘preferential share,’ which
would have been his father’s; while the son in question, the
‘<em>kṣetraja</em>’ is only a ‘<em>secondary</em>’ son.</p>
<p>“Therefore h <em>e should</em> <em>be</em> <em>treated according to law</em>.”—The rule of
partition stated before.</p>
<p>“But if the son in question also happens to be the eldest, wherefore
cannot he obtain exactly what would go to the ‘legitimate’ son?”</p>
<p>The reason for this is stated:—‘<em>In procreation the father</em> <em>is t</em> <em>he
primary</em>.’—The term ‘father’ here stands for the actual <em>progenitor</em>; he
is the principal factor in the act of begetting the son. The
‘<em>kṣetraja</em>’ son, therefore, being begotten by the younger brother, is
<em>secondary</em>.</p>
<p>The verse can be explained only by supplying the words ‘is not equal
to.’</p>
<p>This verse is purely declamatory, supplementing the foregoing
prohibition of the ‘preferential share;’ and since it is declamatory, it
may be explained, by attributing any meaning to the terms ‘primary’ and
‘secondary.’</p>
<p>Others read ‘<em>tasmād dharmeṇa tam tyajet</em>.’ (‘Therefore one should
rightly abandon him).’</p>
<p>But this is not right; since everywhere the ‘<em>kṣetraja</em>’ son has been
declared to be entitled to an equal share with the other sons.</p>
<p>Then again, since this passage is purely declamatory, it could not be
taken as setting forth an optional alternative (to the ‘equal share’
laid down in other texts).—(121)</p>

<p>‘<em>Pradhānasya</em>’.—‘The principal, body-born, son’ (Medhātithi);—‘The

<p>“The <em>subsidiary</em> son has not the same rights as the principal, his dead
father, the husband of his widow-mother; it is this father, the husband
of the widow, who is the ‘principal etc.,’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘the
father is the principal, not the mother, hence even though the mother is
the elder sister-in-law, yet the son does not have the same right as his
dead father’ (Nandana).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 542) as supplying a reason
for what has been said in 120; it adds the following
explanation:—‘<em>upasarjana</em>’ is subsidiary, <em>i.e</em>., the <em>Kṣetraja</em>
son,—it is not lawful that this son should be treated like the
<em>principal</em>, the ‘body-born’, son; because in this case (of <em>niyoga</em>)
the father, the progenitor-uncle, is the ‘principal’;—such is the
explanation given by the author of the <em>Prakāśa</em>. Lakṣmidhara construes
‘<em>Upasarjanam</em>’ as ‘<em>Upasarjanatvam</em>’; but that makes no difference in
the meaning.—‘<em>Dharmeṇa</em>’, according to the injunction of the
scriptures.</p>

<p><strong>(verses 9.122-123)</strong></p>
<p>‘<em>Elder wjfe</em>’—married first:—‘<em>younger wife</em>’—one who was married
later.</p>
<p>As between the sons born of these wives, the question arises whether
‘seniority’ shall he determined by the order in which their mothers have
been married?—or, by the order in which they were themselves born?
Having raised this question, the author answers it in the next
verse;—this method being adopted with a view to making the rule more
easily comprehensible.—(122)</p>
<p>‘<em>Pūrvajaḥ</em>’—he who is horn of the ‘<em>pūrvā</em>,’ the <em>elder</em>, wife, though
himself <em>younger</em> (in age)—is entitled to one excellent hull.</p>
<p>The other bulls that there may be,—‘<em>which are not so good</em>’—shall he
allotted to the other several brothers, one to each.</p>

<p>These verses are quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 473), which adds the
following explanation: The question here raised pertains to the case
where there are several sons born of several mothers belonging to the

for the <em>younger son born of the senior wife</em>, as is clear from the
latter half of the verse; which means that the next best bullocks—those
not the very best—shall belong to those brothers who are ‘junior’ <em>by
reason of the junior position of their mothers</em>; <em>i.e</em>., whose mothers
are junior to the mother of the aforesaid</p>
<p>brother;—and in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 461).</p>

<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.14-17).—‘If a man has several wives, the additional share
of the eldest son is one bull;—but if the eldest son also happen to be
born of the first-married wife, his additional share shall consist of
fifteen cows and one hull. The oldest son born of a later-married wife
shall share the estate equally with his younger brothers born of the
senior wife. Or the special shares shall be adjusted in each class of
sons, according to their mothers.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.15).—‘When there are many sons sprung from one father,
equal in caste and number, but born of different mothers, a legal
division may be effected by adjusting the shares according to the
mothers.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 477).—‘Among sons belonging to castes
other than that of the father, seniority is determined by their moral
character; between twins, by actual birth, <em>i.e</em>., that one is senior
whose face the father sees first.’</p>

<p>This verse puts forward another alternative regarding the ‘preferential
share’ in the ease of sons spoken of in the preceding verses.</p>
<p>If the elder son is born of the younger wife, he shall take <em>fifteen
rows</em>, and a hull as the sixteenth. That the fifteen are meant to be
<em>cows</em> is indicated by the mention of the <em>hull</em>;—the hull needs the cow
as its companion.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>others</em>’—the remaining sons—shall take the cows—‘<em>according to</em>
<em>the</em> <em>seniority of their mothers</em>;’—<em>i.e</em>., he whose mother is senior
shall take a better cow than the one that is taken by him whose mother
is junior.</p>
<p>Or, the verse may be taken as laying down an additional ‘preferential
share’ for the <em>son born of the elder wife</em>,—in addition to what has
been laid down in the preceding verse. In this case, there would be no
‘<em>a</em>’ before the word ‘<em>jyeṣṭhāyām</em>’ (which, in the former explanation
has been taken as ‘<em>ajyeṣṭhāyām</em>’).</p>
<p>It would appear to be necessary to consider what is exactly meant by the
expression ‘<em>according to the seniority of their mothers</em>.’ But,
inasmuch as the two verses (in which the phrase occurs) are purely
declamatory, we make no Attempt to find out its exact meaning.</p>
<p>What has been said hitherto is only by way of a preface; the settled
conclusion is going to be stated now (in the following verse).—(124)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>Medhātithi reads ‘<em>ajyeṣṭhāyām</em>’ and remarks that it is another ‘special
share but it adds that this may be only another special share for the
son of the <em>senior</em> wife (the reading in this case being <em>jyeṣṭhāyām</em>)</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 473), which reads
‘<em>Jyeṣṭhāyām</em>’ and remarks that this lays down another special share for
the brother who is ‘elder’ by reason of being born of the senior
wife.—‘<em>Vṛṣabhaṣoḍaśaḥ</em>’ means ‘cows that have a bull for their
sixteenth’, these <em>cows</em> being the animals that are most cognate to the
animal mentioned, ‘bull—‘<em>Śeṣāḥ</em>’, the remaining brothers, by reason of
the non-seniority of their mothers, should each take a bull which is not
the very best.—It goes on to add that, according to the author of the
<em>Prākāśa</em>, what is here stated by Manu is the opinion of ‘others’,—his
own view being stated in the next verse, where seniority among brothers
is made to rest upon the priority of their birth.—Halāyudha however
explains the three verses (122-124) as follows:—When the younger brother
is born of the senior and the elder from the junior wife, then the
former shall have the best bull as his ‘special share’,—of the other
bulls, which are not the very best, one each should be given to the
other brothers, the quality of each being in accordance with the
respective seniority of their mothers,—and the remainder is to be
divided equally among the brothers (123);—but when the elder brother is
born of the senior wife, then we have the rule laid down in 124: the
cows ‘with a bull as their sixteenth’ goes to the eldest brother, and
each of the other brothers receives as his ‘special share’ one bull, the
quality of which is to be determined by the relative seniority of their
mothers.</p>

<p>“As this verse and the following one contradict the rules given in
verses 123-124, the commentators try to reconcile them in various ways.
Medhātithi thinks that verses 123-124 are an <em>Arthavāda</em>, and have no
legal force, and Rāghavānanda inclines to the same opinion.—Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana hold that the seniority according to the mother’s marriage is of
importance for the law of inheritance (verses 123-124), but that it has
no value with respect to salutations and the like, or to prerogatives at
sacrifices (verses 125-126). Kullūka, finally relying on Govindarāja’s
opinion, thinks that the rules leave an option, and that their
application depends on the existence of good qualities and the want of
such. It is, however, probable that according to the custom of Hindu
writers, the two conflicting opinions are placed side by side, and that
it is intended that the learned should find their way out of the
difficulty as they can.”—Buhler.</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>This is a declamatory text, supporting the view that seniority is to be
determined by birth.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>Subrahmaṇyā</em>’ is the name of a <em>mantra</em>—text recited by the
<em>Chandogas</em> at the <em>Jyotiṣṭoma</em> sacrifice,—occurring in the <em>Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa</em> (63). The plural number in ‘<em>Subrahmaṇyāsu</em>’ is due to the
multiplicity of verses.</p>
<p>In connection with this mantra, the ‘eldest son’ addresses the
invocation to the father—‘Devadatta’s father offers the sacrifice.’
(Where it is the eldest brother who names himself).</p>
<p>Thus it is ‘seniority’ by birth that is <em>real</em> ‘seniority’ in the true
sense; the ‘seniority’ based upon the position of the mother is only
secondary, figurative.</p>
<p>‘<em>Between</em> <em>sons</em> <em>conceiced as twins</em>,’—those that have been
simultaneously conceived—seniority is determined by birth.—(126)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>For the ‘<em>Subrahmaṇyā</em> verses’ see Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 6.3.</p>
<p>According to Rāghavānanda the meaning of the second half is that since
between twins the one born first is the last conceived, the right of
primogeniture is given to the son <em>born</em> last. This is the view hinted
at by a passage in the <em>Uttaracarita</em>, where Lava says of his brother
‘<em>prasvakrameṇa sa kīla jyāyān</em>.’ (Act IV).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodya</em> (Rājanīti, p. 37), which adds the
following notes—That <em>mantra</em> is called ‘<em>Subrahmaṇyā</em>’ which, at the
Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice, is recited for inviting Indra; in this the
‘eldest’ son is represented as addressing the father; and it is the
senior by <em>birth</em> that is regarded as the ‘eldest’; and in a case where
the sacrificer has twin sons, even though the conception of both may
have been simultaneous, yet the son that is <em>born</em> first is held to be
the ‘eldest’; this is the made clear by a text of Devala’s where it is
declared that of twins, that child is to be regarded as the ‘elder’
whose face is seen first In the Saṃskāra section we find the other view
stated (see below).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 477), which has the following
notes—The ‘<em>Subrahmaṇyā</em>’ is the mantra recited at the Jyotiṣṭoma by
<em>Chandoyas</em>, when the form employed is ‘so and so, the father of so and
so is sacrificing’; and here it is the elder son that is named; and he
is the one that is <em>born</em> first.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 161), which adds the
following notes:—Between twins seniority is determined by birth <em>in the
womb</em>; <em>i.e</em>., that child is ‘elder’ who is the first to be born in the
mother’s womb; while the one born, <em>i.e</em>. conceived, later is regarded
as <em>junior</em>; and it is not that seniority belongs to the child that
<em>comes out</em> of the womb first; this conclusion is based on the fact that
the child born later has been <em>conceived</em> earlier and would have been
<em>born earlier</em> also, had not its passage outside been obstructed by the
second child conceived later; the order of conception being the reverse
of that of birth. It is only when both children are <em>born
simultaneously</em> that seniority belongs to one whose face the father sees
first—It goes on to add that this view has been held by ‘some people’
and in reality seniority must be determined by the priority of actual
<em>birth</em> coming out of the womb.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 461 &amp; 702);—and in
<em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em> (p. 828), which has the following
notes—‘<em>Subrahmaṇyā</em>’ is the name of a <em>mantra</em> used, at the Jyotiṣṭoma
sacrifice, for inviting Indra; it is recited along with the name of the
sacrificer’s son, and the rule is that it is the name of the eldest son
that is pronounced; and it is the <em>eldest by age</em> that is taken; so in
partition also; and between twins also, though they are conceived
simultaneously, yet one that is born first is regarded as the <em>elder</em> of
the two.</p>

<p>‘<em>The child that may be born of this girl shall be the performer of my
funeral rites</em>.’ The term ‘<em>svadhā</em>,’ stands for the <em>Śrāddha</em> and the
other after-death rites; it is not necessary that this shall be; the
exact formula uttered. Says Gautama (28.18)—‘The father, having no son,
shall offer sacrifices to Agni and Prajāpati, and shall give away the
appointed daughter, stipulating that <em>the child shall be for me</em>.’—The
opinion of some people is that the daughter becomes <em>appointed</em> by mere
intention, (28.19); from which it is clear that the daughter becomes
‘appointed’ even without the pronouncement of any definite formula.</p>
<p>“In the absence of a distinct stipulation, even though the intention may
be present in the father’s mind, yet, until it has been clearly
declared, the son-in-law may not agree (to surrender the child).”</p>
<p>It is in view of this that the text says—‘<em>Shall make his daughter an
appointed daughter</em>.’—(127)</p>

daughter offers the Ball to her appointing father through her son.</p>

<p>**(verses 9.127-129, 9.132-133)<br>
**</p>
<p>(See below, verse 139.)</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (23.18).—‘A father who has no male issue may <em>appoint</em> his
daughter, offering oblations to Agni and to Prajāpati, and addressing to
the bridegroom the words—“For me be thy male offering.” Some people hold
that the daughter becomes an <em>Appointed Daughter</em> by the mere intention
of her father.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (2.3-15).—‘The male child born of a daughter after an
agreement has been made, is to be known as <em>the son of an appointed
daughter</em>, and other male offspring to the daughter they call <em>the
daughter’s son</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.15-17)—‘The third is the <em>Appointed Daughter</em>;—it is
declared in the Veda—“A maiden who has no brothers comes back to the
male ancestors (of her own family); returning she becomes their son.”
With reference to this matter, there is a verse to be spoken by the
father when appointing his daughter,—“I shall give thee a brotherless
damsel decked with ornaments; the son whom she may hear shall he my
son.’”</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (15.4-5).—‘The third is the son of an Appointed Daughter. She is
called an Appointed Daughter, who is given away by her father with the
words “the son whom she bears shall be mine.” She is called an Appointed
Daughter, though she has not been given away according to the rule of an
Appointed Daughter.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.37-38).—‘Both a son’s son and the son of an Appointed
Daughter lead a man to heaven. Both are pronounced to he equal as
regards their right of inheritance and the duty of offering balls of
meal. Gautama has declared that a daughter is appointed after offering
oblations <em>to Agni</em> and Prajāpati; others have said that she is an
Appointed Daughter who was merely intended to ho one by a man having no
male issue.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 561).—‘Just as the daughter has rights
over her father’s property, even in the presence of the relatives, so is
her son also the owner of the property of his mother’s father.’</p>
<p><em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 562).—‘A sonless man <em>appoints</em> his
daughter as his son,—either in his own mind, or in the presence of the
king, the fire, and his relatives;—or she may have been so appointed
even before her birth and given to her husband on that express
understanding;—or she may be so given away even after her father’s
death. Such an Appointed Daughter obtains an equal share in the property
of her father.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 559).—‘The Appointed Daughter is
like the son; her son offers Piṇḍa to his father’s father as also to his
mother’s father; there is no difference, in the world, between the
daughter’s son and the son’s son, so far as benefit is concerned.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 56, 2-128).—‘The son of the Appointed
Daughter is like the body-born son.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 562, 2-128).—‘The son of the Appointed
Daughter is equal to the son; he inherits the property of his own
father, as also that of his mother’s father, who has no son, as if he
were his own son;—he shall offer the ball of meal to his own as well as
his mother’s father. Whether appointed or not appointed, whichever son
the daughter gives birth to, by that son, does her father also become
<em>endowed with son</em>; and he may offer the hall to him and inherit his
property.</p>
<p>(Devala also reproduces Manu 133.)</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata</em> (13.45-13).—(Same as Manu 132, second-half.)</p>

at the time that the father dies, if the daughter has got no child, it

<p>The term ‘<em>yautaka</em>’ is applied to the separate property of a woman; of
which she alone is the sole owner.—Others apply it to only what she
receives at marriage, and not to all that belongs to her; it is only
over the former that she has an absolute right; as it is said that
‘women become their own mistresses, on obtaining presents at their
marriage.’</p>
<p>Others again hold that the term ‘<em>yautaka</em>’ applies to the savings that
the young woman makes out of what she receives from her husband for her
clothing and ornaments, and also for the daily household expenses.</p>
<p>‘<em>Is the share of the unmarried daughter only</em>.’—Since the text adds the
qualification ‘unmarried,’ it is clear that what is said here does not
apply to one who has been married. Further, the term ‘<em>eva</em>,’ ‘only,’
referring to what is well known, sets aside the implications of the
context; consequently, what is said here (regarding the mother’s
property) cannot apply to the ‘appointed daughter’ (who would be
<em>married</em>).</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em>—after having declared that the woman’s property descends to
her children’ (28.24)—adds—‘To her daughters who are unmarried and
unsettled;’ where ‘unsettled’ stands for those who, though married, are
childless, and without any property of their own, not having obtained a
footing in the house of their husbands.</p>
<p>‘<em>The grandson alone is to inherit</em>’—the entire property of the man who
dies without a legitimate son. What would be the share of the grandson,
when the man dies leaving a legitimate son, shall he declared Inter on.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>grandson</em>’ stands for <em>the son of the appointed daughter</em>, in
the present sentence only, not throughout the context; as it is only in
connection with the ‘mother’s separate property’ (mentioned in the first
half of the verse) that there is any authority for rejecting the
implications of the context (which refers to the <em>Appointed
Daughter</em>).—(131)</p>

<p>“According to Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa, all <em>Strīdhana</em> is
meant;—according to ‘others’ mentioned by Medhātithi, Nandana and
Rāghavānanda, the so-called ‘<em>saudāyika</em>’ or property derived from the
father’s family.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>‘<em>Kumārī</em>’—‘an unmarried daughter (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘a daughter
who has no sons’ (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>The first half of this verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 517)
which adds the following notes:—‘<em>Yautakam</em>’ here stands for what has
been given to the girl at the time of her marriage, by her father and
other relatives. Halāyudha however holds that it stands for what has
been given to the woman for such household purposes as the purchase of
vegetables and other things, out of which, by her clever management, she
may have saved and increased by judicious handling. To such property of
the mother either the sons or the married daughters can have no right,
as a rule; but if among the married daughters there be such as are
childless or otherwise ill-conditioned, these are to have an equal share
in the property.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 372), which explains
‘<em>yautakam</em>’ as ‘property obtained from the father’s family’;—in
<em>Aparārka</em> (p. 721), to the effect that when the mother’s property comes
to be divided among her daughters, the unmarried ones have the
preference over the married ones;—in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 186), which
has the following note:—The term ‘<em>yautaka</em>’ is derived from the root
‘yu’ (to join), and hence signifying <em>junction</em>, or <em>union</em>, it stands
for ‘what is given at marriage’;—in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 631 and
750);—in <em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em> (p. 21);—and by <em>Jīmūtavāhana</em>
(<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 132), which says ‘<em>yautakam</em>’ stands for the dowry
obtained at marriage,—this being indicated by the root ‘<em>yu</em>’ (to join)
from which the word is derived,—marriage being the ‘<em>joining</em>’ of the
husband and wife.</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>That the son of the Appointed Daughter shall inherit the entire property
of the father having been already laid down in the foregoing verse, the
present verse has been explained by some people as laying down the
necessity of ottering the two cakes, with reference to the
said^(‘)daughter’s son.’ And according to these people the reading is
‘<em>hared yadi</em>,’ ‘if the son of the Appointed Daughter inherits, etc.,
etc.’</p>
<p>According to this view, the offering of the cakes would he incumbent
only in the event of the man inheriting the entire property; so that he
need not offer the cakes in the event of his receiving an ‘equal share’
(as laid down under 131 below). If this were not the meaning, then there
would be no point in the injunction, if the <em>offering of cakes</em>, which
would he already indicated by the general law that ‘one shall make
offerings to him From whom he receives anything.’ And in that ease any
reference to the inheriting of the ‘<em>entire</em> property’ would he absolute
purposeless.</p>
<p>This explanation however cannot be right. What is meant is that he
‘shall inherit the property of the sunless father;’ and ‘<em>aputrasya
pitur haret</em>’ is the long-accepted reading also. The term^(‘)father’
also is known to apply to the actual <em>progenitor</em>, and not to the
<em>maternal grandfather</em>. Henee what is meant is that ‘if the husband of
the <em>appointed daughter</em> has no son from any other wife, but has one
from the <em>appointed daughter</em>, then this same son shall be the son for
his own father, as also for his mother’s father.’ If however, the
progenitor has sons from his other wives, then the son born of the
‘appointed daughter’ shall neither inherit the property of, nor offer
cakes to, him;—even though he may be born of a mother belonging to the
same caste as his father. The relation of the ‘progeny and progenitor’
is different from that of ‘father and son.’ Even though the ‘fathers’ of
‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ and some oilier kinds of son, are not their ‘progenitors,’
yet they are regarded as having those as their ‘issue’; while the
fathers of the ‘purchased,’ and the ‘abandoned’ sons, even though their
actual ‘progenitors,’ are not regarded as having them as their ‘issue’;
as happened in the case of Ajīgarta and other persons (who sold their
sons to other persons). In the definition of the ‘<em>Aurasa</em>’
‘legitimate,’ son (9.166), we find the words ‘in <em>his own</em> soil’; and in
the ease of the ‘appointed daughter’ the ‘soil’ belongs to her
father;—her husband being only one who has wedded her and as such, is
entitled to obedience and service.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the conclusion should be as follows:—in a ease where
the husband of the ‘appointed daughter’ has no other sons, the son of
the ‘appointed daughter’ shall inherit his entire property, and also
offer funeral cakes to him. If however the father has sons from other
wives, him the son of the ‘appointed daughter,’ shall not offer cukes to
his father.</p>
<p>Such a son is called ‘<em>daughter’s son</em>,’ <em>i.e</em>., the son of the
<em>appointed daughter</em>. In the case of the grandfather also, the same
principle applies as that in the case of the father;—that is, he shall
otter the cake to him whose property he inherits; and not in any other
case. As a matter of fact, the injunction that ‘ho shall offer the cakes
when he inherits the entire property’ does not necessarily imply that
there should be no offering in other cases. Because there being no
reference to the father and the grandfather, any such implication would
be of the nature of ‘preclusion.’ If there were an implication, oven in
the absence of such a reference, the deduction would be that offerings
should be made to both. Bo that the meaning would be that—‘just as cakes
are offered to the father and the maternal grandfather, so should they
be offered also to the paternal grandfather and the maternal
great-grandfather, the two ancestors above the former two
respectively.—(132)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 560), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Aputrasya</em>’ <em>i.e</em>., one who has no ‘body-born’
son;—the second half is a mere reiteration of what goes before—says
<em>Prakāśa</em>; it is an Arthavāda providing a reason for what has gone
before—says Udayakara in his commentary on Manu. [These remarks are
based on the reading of the second line as <em>dauhitra eva tu
haredaputrasyāsvilaṃ dhanam</em> ].</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 631 and 664);—in <em>Hemādri</em>
(Śrādha, p. 87);—in <em>Gadādharapaddhati</em> (Kāla, p. 427), which says that
the two ‘balls’ are to be offered to the father and to the mother’s
father;—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 153) which adds that this
refers to cases where neither of the parents of the deceased is
alive;—and by Jīmūtavāhāna (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 278) as indicating that the
grandson is entitled to the property of his mother’s father by reason of
the mother deriving her body from that father.</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 541), which adds the
following notes:—The ‘<em>putra</em>’ here stands for the <em>aurasa</em>,
‘body-born,’ son;—‘<em>anu</em>’, after the ‘appointment’ of the
daughter;—‘<em>striyāḥ</em>’, of the ‘appointed daughter’; who the ‘appointed
daughter’ is, is described by Manu in verse 127.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.132) to the effect that when both the
sons—the body-born son and the son born of the ‘appointed daughter’—are
there, all the property is <em>not</em> to go to the former only. The
<em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds that the meaning of the last quarter is that the
‘special portion’ ordained for the ‘eldest son’ does not accrue to the
‘appointed daughter’ or her son.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 739);—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p.
347), which has the same note as the <em>Mitākṣarā</em>;—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em>
(p. 654);—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 150);—in
<em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em> (p. 51);—by Jīmūtavāhan (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, pp. 223 and
67), as setting forth a reason why the Appointed Daughter should offer
the Ball through her son.</p>

<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.33, 35).—‘Of the thirteen sons mentioned by Manu, the
Body-horn son and the Appointed Daughter continue the family. No one hut
a Body-born son is declared to be the father’s heir; an Appointed
Daughter is equal to him; all the others are entitled to maintenance
only.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 347).—‘On the birth of a
Body-born son, the other sons are entitled to only a fourth part of the
share, if they belong to the same caste as the father; if they belong to
lower castes, they are entitled to food and clothing only.’</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>So far it would appear that the husband of the Appointed Daughter who
has had no issue, has nothing to do with the property in question; hence
the present text lays down his connection with it.</p>
<p>In this connection there arises the question:—“Does the Appointed
Daughter become ‘sanctified’ by marriage or not? If she <em>is</em> sanctified,
then she becomes a <em>wife</em>; as ‘marriage’ consists in ‘making a wife.’
And in that case her property naturally reverts to her husband (?). If,
on the other hand, she is <em>not</em> sanctified by the marriage,—then, as she
would still continue to be a <em>maiden</em>, her husband’s intercourse with
her would he of the nature of having intercourse with an unmarried
maiden, and would he a direct contravention of the rule that one should
always remain attached to his own wife.”</p>
<p>You may take it any way you choose. (?)</p>
<p>“But in that case the present verse becomes meaningless.”</p>
<p>There is no force in this objection. In order to complete the usefulness
of the verse, it should he taken as meant to set aside the notion that
‘just as the child horn of the Appointed Daughter does not belong to her
husband, so would her property also not be inherited by him.’ As a
matter of fact, again, there are several verses in the work of Manu that
are purely declamatory.</p>
<p>Or, (for the sake of argument) it may be said that the Appointed
Daughter is <em>not</em> sanctified by Marriage. Even so, intercourse with her
would not mean intercourse with a maiden.—“How so?”—Because all that is
meant is that the child born of her shall belong to its mother’s father;
and any consideration of extraneous matters is entirely out of place (?)
Then again, the act of the husband of the Appointed Daughter is not
among those that make one an ‘outcaste’ (as it would, if it meant
intercourse with a maiden).</p>
<p>Further, is the argument that ‘it moans intercourse with a maiden’ urged
on the understanding that the name ‘maiden’ stands for the <em>remarried
widow</em>? As a matter of fact, there are three kinds of ‘maidens’—(l) one
who has had no sexual intercourse with a male, (2) one who has dedicated
herself to lifelong service of temples, and (3) one who is still a
child. Now, if the objector understands the term ‘maiden’ as standing
tor one who has had no sexual intercourse, then, the first intercourse
that the husband has with his married wife would also be ‘intercourse
with a <em>maiden</em>.’ In the present treatise, the term ‘<em>kanyā</em>,’ ‘maiden,’
is generally used in the sense of ‘one who has had no sexual intercourse
with a male.’</p>
<p>If the term ‘maiden’ be taken to stand for <em>one for whom the sacraments
have not been performed</em>,—that cannot he right; as words expressive of
that would he forthcoming at the very outset (?) In fact, it is only on
the strength of other authorities that the term is taken figuratively as
standing for the said person (?) It has been said that—‘all the sacred
texts used at marriage are applicable to maidens only, and never to
non-maidens, because the latter are such as have fallen off from all
religious rites’ (8.226); and the mention of ‘falling off from religious
rites’ is clearly indicative of the fact that the girl who has had
intercourse with man is a ‘non-maiden’; and obviously, she who has not
had such intercourse is a ‘maiden.’ In all these cases the ‘rites’
referred to are those that are done in accordance with the direct
signification of the term ‘maiden.’ Now the question arises whether this
is so in the case of all ‘rites, ‘or only in those in regard to which
there are other authorities? Now, as regards the son called
‘<em>maiden-born</em>’ ‘<em>Kānīna</em>,’ the very name indicates that the girl is
still under her father and is devoid of the sacramental rite (of
marriage). If the name indicated only <em>the absence of religions
rites</em>,—<em>i</em> <em>e</em>., if the name ‘maiden-horn’ applied to the child not
born of lawful wed-lock,—then the son of the <em>married</em> woman also,
begotten by men other than her husband, would he ‘maiden-born.’ On the
other hand, if the name indicated the <em>ownership of the father</em> only,
then the daughter of the Appointed Daughter also would come to be called
‘maiden-born’.</p>
<p>It has been said above that intercourse with the ‘maiden’ involves the
transgression of the law that one should have intercourse with his
‘<em>wife</em>’ only, lint this law does not mean that, ‘one should not have
intercourse with women other than his wife,’ or that, ‘he should not
love another woman or another wife.’ Because if it meant that, then all
this prohibition being already contained in this law, any separate
prohibition of ‘intercourse with the wives of others’ would he entirely
superfluous. What the said law does mean is that ‘the man shall cherish
love for his wife,’—the cultivating of the feelings of love being
conducive to great happiness. (?) The passage—‘One should not cherish
desire for any woman, nor the wife of another man, as by avoiding this
he falls not off from virtue’—is a mere reiteration. Or, it may only
mean the injunction that ‘while remaining attached to his own wife, one
should avoid intercourse with her on the sacred days.’ Even so, the
injunction would be only supplementary to another. Nor would the case in
question fall within the prohibition of intercourse with ‘<em>another’s
wife</em>’; because so long as she has not been married, she cannot, be
called ‘wife.’</p>
<p>Now what is the right course to adopt?</p>
<p>The right course is that the girl (Appointed Daughter) should not be
wedded by any person. There are eight forms of marriage; they have been
styled ‘<em>Brāhma</em>’ and the rest, in accordance with the nature of the
manner of acceptance involved in each; and in the case of the Appointed
Daughter, there is no ‘acceptance’ (or <em>making own</em>); as in her case,
the ownership of the girl’s father does not cease. Further, the very
prohibition regarding the marrying of a brotherless girl implies that
one should not marry the ‘Appointed Daughter.’ It is said for instance
that—‘one should not marry a brotherless girl, as her son belongs to her
father’ (<em>Gautama</em>, 28.20). This prohibition occurs in a special
context; and the trangression of this would make the marriage lose its
true sacramental character; just as the marrying of a <em>Śūdru</em> girl by a
Brāhmaṇa deprives his ‘fire’ of the ‘<em>Āhavanīya</em>’ (sacrificial)
character.</p>
<p>Mere prohibition however of a certain marriage does not necessarily
deprive it of its sacramental character. In many eases, for instance,
people marry the ‘tawny girl,’ and several such others as are forbidden;
and with the assistance of those wives they do cany on their religious
duties. But if the girl belongs to the same <em>Gotra</em> or <em>Pravara</em> as her
husband’s, then, even though she has been ‘<em>married</em>,’ she cannot
fulfill the duties of the ‘wife’ for him. It is in view of this fact
that in connection with the rule that—‘one should not marry the lawny
girl ete., etc.,’—some people have held that the prohibition, pertains
to the <em>visible</em> disabilities, and hence it does not stand on the same
footing as the prohibition of the marrying of a ‘<em>sapiṇḍa</em>’ girl; though
both the prohibitions occur in the same context.</p>
<p>“Wherefore then is there any prohibition as to the case of the Appointed
Daughter falling under Marriage?” Because as a supplement to the said
prohibition, there is the assertion ‘because the child belongs to the
father.’</p>
<p>Thus then, it is only in so far as the obtaining of children is
concerned that the Appointed Daughter cannot he one’s ‘wife’; she is
fully entitled to assist as ‘wife’ in all that relates to sacred duties,
property and pleasure.</p>
<p>This may ho so; yet, inasmuch as she cannot become the man’s <em>own</em>,
there can be no real <em>marriage</em> (which implies <em>ownership</em>).</p>
<p>“In that case the son of the Appointed Daughter would be ‘maiden-born.’
Because he would not belong to his progenitor; he being the child of
parents not lawfully wedded, if however, the marriage of the Appointed
Daughter <em>is</em> of the nature of a ‘sacrament,’ the child fulfills both
conditions—that of belonging to his progenitor and being born of duly
hallowed wed-lock. And if he fails in only one of those two conditions,
he is still different from the^(‘)maiden-born.’”</p>
<p>Our answer to the above is as follows:—The character of
the^(‘)maiden-born’ son is not present in the son of the Appointed
Daughter.</p>
<p>The definition of the ‘maiden-horn’ is thus stated—‘A son whom a maiden
secretly bears in her father’s house, one should call <em>maiden-born</em> by
name; and the child horn of the maiden belongs to the man who marries
her’ (9.172). And the meaning of this is as follows.—‘If a son fulfills
these conditions, he shall he regarded in this treatise as
<em>maiden-born</em>; and the question arising as to the person to whom such a
son belongs, the text adds, as an additional sentence, that ‘the child
horn of the maiden belongs to the man who marries her.’ Or, this text
may he taken not as defining the particular kind of son, but simply as
declaring his <em>relationship</em>;—the sense being that ‘the maiden-born son
should he regarded as related to the person who marries the girl’; so
that the whole text forms one connected sentence. As a matter of fact,
relationship varies with variations in the persons concerned and the
attendant circumstances,—such for instance, as while the one (the
maiden-born) is begotten <em>secretly</em>, the other (that of the Appointed
Daughter) is begotten openly.</p>
<p>Thus the idea that the text quoted supplies the definition of the
‘maiden-born’ son should be regarded as repudiated. It only points out
that the child is^(‘)maiden-born’&hellip;.(?)</p>
<p>Others however have declared that the <em>Smṛti</em> text itself has a special
hearing; the name^(‘)maiden-horn’ is not applied to every child of an
unmarried^(‘)maiden’; it applies only to such a child as has been
defined by Manu.</p>
<p>This view also we accept (??)—(135)</p>

<p>‘<em>Dhanam</em>.’—‘What the appointed daughter received from her father either
during his life-time or on his death.’ (Nārāyaṇa).—But Kullūka says that
this prohibits the father inheriting the appointed daughter’s estate on
the plea that she was his ‘son.’—According to Nandana it precludes the
paternal uncle and other relatives from inheriting the property of an
appointed daughter.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p.754), which adds that this refers
to the case of the daughter who has been ‘appointed’ under the terms
that ‘the son born of this girl shall be mine’, and not to that of one
who is ‘appointed’ as herself being the ‘son’; in the case of the latter
the husband is precluded from inheriting her property, by Paiṭhīnasi.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 520), which adds that this rule is
meant for cases where the dead sonless daughter has no unmarried
daughter or sister;—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 374), which adds
that this refers to cases where no brother-is born to the lady, oven
subsequently;—in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 742 and 765);—and by
Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em> p. 276), which says that this refers to cases

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>By duly considering what has gone before and what follows next, it is
clear that the present verse also refers to the Appointed Daughter.</p>
<p>It has been said that the son of the <em>unappointed</em> daughter also is
entitled to the property of his maternal grandfather; how much more so
is the son of the Appointed Daughter entitled to it?—This is the idea
meant to be expressed. The verse cannot he taken as laying down the
title of the grandson to the property of the maternal grandfather; for
if such a general principle were recognised, then there would be no need
for the institution of the ‘appointed daughter’ at all.</p>
<p>“But in another Smṛti text it is found to be laid down that it is
incumbent upon every daughter’s son to offer the cake to his maternal
grandfather:—‘so also on behalf of the mother’s fathers’ (<em>Yājañvalkya</em>,
1.228). And in the present verse also, if we ignore the fact of its
occurring in a context dealing with the ‘appointed daughter,’ and bear
in mind the words of the text itself, it appeal’s only reasonable to
take, as pertaining to every daughter’s son, the injunction regarding
‘the offering of cakes and the inheriting of property. In another text
also, it has been declared that ‘the <em>daughter’s son</em> shall take the
entire property etc., etc.’ (<em>Manu</em>, 9.132).”</p>
<p>Our answer to the above is as follows:—In the text quoted from
Yājñavalkya, we find the term ‘mother’s <em>fathers</em>’</p>
<p>in the plural; now does this refer directly to the individual ‘father,’
or indirectly to the ‘mother’s <em>grandfather</em>’ and other ancestors? In
the former case, it would mean that the offering is to be made to the
<em>maternal grandfather</em> only, just like the ordinary ‘<em>Śrāddha</em>’ and
other offerings; and this would be wrong, after the ‘<em>Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa</em>’
has been done (which has unified the mother’s father with her

‘after the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa one shall offer cakes to all the three.’ If it
be held that the <em>Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa</em> rite itself may not be performed. But
this also could not be; as the performance of it is nowhere forbidden.
As for ‘indirect’ indication, it can be justified only under very
special circumstances; and then too it must be in consonance with the
direct declaration of <em>Śruti texts</em>. And it is only in very special
circumstances that a text ean be entirely separated from the context in
which it occurs; as is found to be the case in regard to the ‘Twelve
Upasads.’ (<em>Mīmāṃsā</em> Sūtra. 3.3.15-16).</p>
<p>As for the epithet ‘<em>not appointed</em>,’ it has been already explained that
it means something quite different.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, the verse must be taken as referring to <em>the son
of the Appointed Daughter</em> only.—(136)</p>

<p>‘(<em>a</em>) <em>Akṛtā vā</em> (<em>b</em>) <em>kṛtā</em>.’—(<em>a</em>) ‘Daughter <em>not appointed</em>
explicitly, and (<em>b</em>) one appointed explicitly’ (Kullūka);—(<em>b</em>)
‘unappointed, <em>i.e</em>., any ordinary daughter’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa
Nandana);—the ‘unappointed daughter’ is added only hyperbolically, the
meaning being that ‘when even the unappointed daughter is entitled to
inherit, the appointed one is all the more entitled’ (Medhātithi).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.136), to the effect that in the
absence of the son and the daughter, the property goes to the daughter’s
son. The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds that Vijñāneśvara had taken the verse as
applying <em>to all</em> daughters, but Medhātīthi has come to the conclusion
that the rule is meant for the ‘Appointed Daughter’ only.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 435), to the effect that the ‘daughter’s
son’ who inherits his grand-father’s property must offer <em>Śrāddhas</em> to
him;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra 40b);—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra,
p. 190a and 205b), which explains that the Appointed Daughter being a
‘son’, her son, even though the ‘son of a daughter’ (<em>dauhitra</em>) is
virtually the ‘son’s son’ (<em>pautra</em>); and hence just as the son’s son
inherits the property op the failure of the son, so does the daughter’s
son also, on the failure of the daughter;—and by Jîmūtavāhana
(<em>Dāyabhāga</em>. p. 224).</p>

<p>Under 9.185, it is said—‘Sons, and not brothers or fathers, are the
inheritors of the father’s property’—where all sons are declared to be
entitled to inheritance. So long as the ‘legitimate’ son is alive, the
‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ and other sons are entitled to maintenance only: ‘The
legitimate son alone is the sole master of the entire paternal property;
for the others he shall, as an act of kindness, provide for
subsistence,’ says Manu (9.163). Thus then the fact of the adopted son
inheriting the lather’s property is already established; the present
text therefore is meant to indicate that he is so entitled, even when
the legitimate son is there. If it did not mean this, there would he no
point in the verse at all.</p>
<p>The question that arises is—what shall he the share of the adopted son?</p>
<p>Some people hold that, since nothing particular has been laid down, the
share shall he equal to that of the legitimate son.</p>
<p>This however is not right. If shares had been meant to be equal, then
this would have been clearly stated, as it has been in the case of the
son of the Appointed Daughter (under 9.134). Hence it follows that, as
in the ease of the <em>Kṣetraja</em> son, so here also, the share shall be the
sixth or eighth part (of that of the legitimate son).</p>
<p>In this connection there is something to be said. Just as the author has
declared the share of the <em>Kṣetraja</em> son to be ‘the sixth part’ (9.164),
that, of the ‘adopted’ son also would have been prescribed (if it were
so intended).</p>
<p>Thus then, the real purport of the reiteration contained in the present
verse has got to be found out.</p>
<p>Our revered teacher explains as follows:—The idea provided by the
present verse is that, inasmuch as no particular share has been
specified, the slare of the adopted son should be understood to be less
than that of the <em>Kṣetraja</em>; and he cannot, go without, a share; nor is
he entitled to a share equal to that of the <em>legitimate sun</em>, or to that
of the <em>Kṣetraja</em> son.—(141)</p>

<p>“Medhātīthi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda refer this rule to the case where
a man has a legitimate son and an adopted son, and think that in such a
case the latter, being eminently virtuous, shall receive, like the
<em>Kṣetraja</em>, a fifth or sixth part of the Estate. Medhātithi remarks that
some think he is to have half, but that this opinion is improper, and
finally that <em>Upadhyāya</em>, <em>i.e</em>., his teacher, allots to the adopted son
less than to the <em>Kṣetraja</em>.—Kullūka and Rāghavānanda state that
Govindarāja took the verse to mean that the eminently virtuous adopted,
son shall inherit on failure of a legitimate son and of the son of the
wife, but that this explanation is inadmissible on account of verse
165.—Nārāyaṇa says ‘it has been declared that the adopted son receives a
share like the chief son, when he is eminently virtuous’.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 567), which adds the
following note:—‘<em>Guṇaīḥ</em>’, such as caste, learning and character;—the
fact of this adopted son being entitled to inherit being patent from the
fact of his being a ‘son’, the specific mention of ‘being endowed with
virtues’ is meant to indicate that in a case where a body-born son
happens to he born after the adoption, the adopted son is to have a
share in the inheritance only if he is ‘endowed with virtues’, while if
he is not so endowed, he is entitled to maintenance only.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Dattakamīmāṃsā</em> (p. 28) as countenancing the adopted
son’s inheritance of the entire property of the adoptive father, when
the latter leaves no ‘body-born’ son;—in <em>Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi</em> (p. 370),
to the effect that the adopted son is entitled to an equal share with
the ‘body-born’ son;—and in <em>Saṃskāra-ratnamālā</em> (p. 769) to the same
effect as <em>Dattakamīmāṃsā</em>.</p>

<p>It is only right that the adopted son should have a share in his
adoptive father’s property; since he does not inherit either the
family-name or the property of his progenitor; and this for the simple
reason that he has gone out of the family.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as he does not inherit the family-name and the property of the
progenitor, he does not offer cakes to him; since ‘<em>the cake follows the
family-name and the property</em>’;—that is, a son offers the funeral cakes
etc., to that preson whose family-name and property he inherits.</p>
<p>‘<em>Ceases</em>’— drops away from him.</p>
<p>‘<em>Svadhā</em>’;—this syllable stands for that which makes the use of the
syllable ‘<em>svadhā</em>’ possible;—<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>., the <em>Śrāddha</em> and other
offerings. And when a man gives away his son to another man, those
offerings cease for him; that is. they should not be offered to him.</p>
<p>This law applies to the ‘made’ and other kinds of sons,—<em>i.e</em>., ‘the one
conceived before marriage,’ the ‘cast off’ and ‘the one who benefits
both.’</p>
<p>Others construe ‘<em>haret</em>’ as implying the causal form ‘<em>hārayet</em>’,
‘should deprive’; which means that the adopted son shall benefit both
fathers.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is that the verse opens with the
<em>relinquishing of privileges</em>; so that consistently with that, the
latter half also should mean that ‘no cake shall be offered’; <em>i.e</em>.,
the father also shall relinquish his privilege of receiving the cakes.</p>
<p>In the face of these facts, some authority will have to be found for
attributing a different meaning to the words (‘<em>haret</em>’ and the
rest).—(142)</p>

<p>“The general meaning is that all connections with the first family
ceases. Nevertheless, according to Kātyāyana and the later usage, if
there is a special agreement to that effect, the son may belong to both
fathers (<em>dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa</em>)”.—Hopkins.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.132), which notes that ‘adopted
son’ is here mentioned as representing all kinds of secondary ‘sons all
of whom are entitled to inherit the ‘father’s’ property, as is clear
from verse 185 below.—The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> has the following
notes:—‘<em>Datrimaḥ</em>’ is the same as ‘<em>dattaka</em>’, the adopted
son;—‘<em>janayituḥ</em>’, of the progenitor;—according to Medhātithi
‘<em>janayituḥ</em>’ is to be taken as with the Ablative ending; thus then the
adopted son is not affected by the impurity consequent on the death of
his progenitor. This verse permits the adopting of sons even of <em>gotras</em>
other than the adopter’s own.—‘<em>Pīṇḍa</em>’ means the offering of <em>śrāddha</em>,
and this offering of <em>śrāddha</em> follows the <em>gotra</em> and the inheritance,
<em>i.e</em>. śrāddha is to be offered to that ‘father’ whose ‘gotra’ and
‘inheritance’ one receives;—it is for this reason that the ‘<em>svadhā</em>’
<em>i.e</em>., <em>śrāddha</em>, offered by the adopted son, ceases—‘<em>vyapaiti</em>’—from
the person who gave the son to be adopted by another; <em>i.e</em>. the adopted
son shall not offer <em>śrāddha</em> to that person.—In reality however the
term ‘<em>piṇḍa</em>’ here stands for ‘<em>sāpiṇḍya</em> if it is taken in the sense
of ‘<em>śrāddha</em>’. then the subsequent sentence ‘<em>vyapaiti svadhā</em>’ becomes
a superfluous repetition. It is for this reason that all cultured people
treat, in all matters, the adopted son as belonging to the <em>gotra</em> of
the adoptive father, and on the death of the adopted son, it is the
<em>sapiṇḍas</em> of the adoptive father that observe impurity for ten days;
and in all matters he is regarded as a ‘<em>sapiṇḍa</em>’ of the family of the
adoptive father. It is for the same reason that the adopted son is
regarded as having ceased to be the <em>sapiṇḍa</em> of his progenitor’s
family.—All this however holds good in a case where the progenitor has
got other sons; in cases where he has none such, his property must go to
his begotten son, even though adopted by another person; and he must
perform his <em>śrāddha</em> also. It is in this sense that the
‘<em>dvyāmuṣyāyana</em>’ has been held to benefit both the families,</p>
<p>The verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 351), which adds
the following notes:—The ‘adopted’ son is mentioned only by way of
illustration, it stands for all the secondary sons.—Though there are
texts that lay down that the secondary sons are entitled to inherit the
property of the ‘father’, yet these must refer to other <em>Yugas</em>, except
so far as the ‘adopted’ son is concerned, who inherits in <em>Kali-yuga</em>
also.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 208), as indicating the
legality of adopting sons of other <em>gotras</em> also. It proceeds to set
forth the order of preference among the several alternatives regarding
the <em>gotra</em> &amp;c. of the son to be adopted:—(1) One who is both <em>sagotra</em>
and <em>sapiṇḍa</em> of the adopter,—(2) who is <em>sapiṇḍa</em> but not
<em>sagotra</em>,—(3) who is <em>sagotra</em> but not <em>sapiṇḍa</em>,—(4) who has the same
<em>pravaras</em>,—(5) who is neither <em>sagotra</em> nor <em>sapiṇḍa</em> nor
<em>sapravara</em>.—It is quoted again on p. 686, as likely to be understood as
prohibiting the performance of <em>śrāddha</em> for the progenitor, and hence
implying that the son adopted by another person ceases to be the
‘<em>sapiṇḍa</em>’ of his progenitor.—It is quoted again on p. 716, where the
following notes are added:—The adopted son is not to take the ‘<em>gotra</em>’
or the ‘estate’ of his progenitor, and the ‘<em>sapiṇḍa</em> character’ as also
the ‘performance of śrādhā’ of the person who <em>gives away</em> the son to be
adopted,—becomes removed from the adopted son; and the reason for this
is that the Pīṇḍa follows the ‘gotra and the estate’ and hence ceases
when these two cease.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 38), where the clause
‘<em>gotrarikthānugaḥ piṇḍah</em>’ only is quoted in support of the principle
that inheritance is based upon the benefit conferred by the inheritor
upon the original owner of the property.—It is quoted again on p. 384 as
indicating the superiority of the Daughter to the adopted and other
secondary sons;—and again on p. 391, as laying down that the liability
to offering Piṇḍas is based upon the inheritance of property.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 278), which notes that what is here
stated refers to cases where the progenitor has other sons.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 568), which adds that in view of
the general principle that the ‘offering of Piṇḍas’ follows ‘gotra and
inheritance’, the former ceases in the case stated;—‘<em>svadhā</em>’ stands
for <em>śrāddha</em> and other offerings.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 51), which adds the following
notes:—The meaning is that the ‘<em>Piṇḍa</em>’ is concomitant with ‘gotra and
inheritance’;—this refers to the ‘purely adopted son’, the
<em>Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa</em> retaining the <em>gotra</em>, etc., of his progenitor
also;—‘<em>Piṇḍa</em>’ stands for the <em>śrāddha</em> and other after-death rites,
according to Medhātithi, Kullūka Bhaṭṭa and others; while, according to
others, ‘<em>piṇḍa</em>’ stands for the ‘<em>sapiṇḍa</em>-character’ and ‘<em>svadhā</em>’
for the <em>śrāddha</em> and other after-death rites; as a matter of fact,
however, what the terms “<em>gotra-rikṭha-piṇḍa-svadhā</em>” stand for is all
that, is due to the relationship of the progenitor; and all this is
precluded in the case in question; thus it follows that the adopted son
ceases to have the relation of ‘uterine brotherhood’ with the other sons
of his progenitor, and so forth.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 135) as indicating the change of
<em>gotra</em> for the adopted son;—in <em>Gotrapravaranihandhakadamba</em> (p. 185),
which says that this applies only to the offering of <em>Śrāddha</em> and such
things;—in <em>Smṛticandrikā</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 185) as laying down the
cessation of the generator’s <em>gotra</em>;—in <em>Saṃskāramayūkha</em> (p. 79) as
lending support to the view that the son adopted in another family loses
the <em>Sāpiṇḍya</em> also of his progenitor’s family; in <em>Saṃskāraratnamālā</em>
(p. 455), which says that this is meant for cases where the progenitor
has got another son;—in <em>Dattakamīmānsā</em> (p. 30), which explains the
second line to mean that ‘in giving his son for being adopted by another
person, he relinquishes the śrāddha that that son would have
offered’;—in <em>Dattakacandrikā</em> (p. 53), which explains the verse to mean
that—‘By the mere act of being given to be adopted the son ceases to be
a <em>son</em> to his progenitor, and thereby relinquishes all his <em>gotra</em> and
all claims to his property’;—and in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (śrāddha 4a).</p>

<p>It has been declared above that, when the husband dies without male
issue, the wife should obtain the sanction of her elders for the
begetting of a son. And this same declaration is reiterated here.</p>
<p>If a woman is ‘<em>not authorised</em>’ by her elders, and yet being anxious
for a son, begets one,—under the impression that she being the ‘soil’ of
her husband, the son born of her would be his ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ son and thus
entitled to inherit his property,—a son born in this manner shall not
inherit his father’s property; because a son is called ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ only
when he is born in the manner expressly laid down in the scriptures; and
it. is only then that he inherits the property of the ‘owner of the
soil’ (his dead father). It is for this reason that the present verse
denies the <em>inheriting capacity</em> of the son born of the woman not duly
‘authorised;’ but it does not forbid the offering of the funeral cake;
even though the son is one born of an ‘outcast’ woman.</p>
<p>Narada (13.19 <em>et. seq</em>) lays down a special rule—‘Those that are born
from an unauthorised woman, either by one or by several men, are not
entitled to the property of their father; being, as they are, the sons
of the persons from whose seed they have been born;—they shall offer the
cake to the person from whose seed they are born, specially if the
mother has been obtained by 1 he payment of the nuptial foe; if however
the mother has not been obtained by the payment of the fee, they shall
offer the cake to the person who had wedded their mother,’</p>
<p>The text uses the term ‘<em>suta</em>,’ ‘<em>offspring</em>’ (instead of ‘<em>putra</em>’
son), because the child referred to is not born in accordance with the
law relating to the ‘adopted’ and other sons, and is, on that account,
not mentioned among ‘sons.’ Among the twice-born people the issues of
one’s mere ‘seed’ (and not of lawful wedlock) are entitled to mere
subsistence, and not to the inheritance of property; specially as in
connection with all kinds of sons it has been declared that ‘on the
death of their father the sons shall divide among themselves the
property of their father, left over after the performance of the
necessary religious rites; and they are all entitled to maintenance,’
Thus it is the duty of the Legitimate son to provide for the maintenance
of the unlawfully-begotten sons; but these latter are not entitled to
any inheritance in the property; specially because inheritance has been
declared to belong to those particular kinds of sons that have been
specially enumerated: We read (in 9.102) of ‘the <em>two</em> heirs’ (whore
only <em>two</em> sons are spoken of as ‘heirs’).</p>
<p>From what is said here it follows that ‘the issue of the unauthorised
woman,’ not entitled to the property of his lawful father, does become a
sharer in that of the person from whose seed he is born; and the share
in this case would be just enough for his subsistence.</p>
<p>Then again, as the woman has been obtained at a price, she is a ‘slave,’
and the son ‘slave-born;’ and as such, he is entitled not to a share in
the property, but to mere subsistence.</p>
<p>Others have held that, even though the woman may not be a regular
‘slave’ (in the technical sense), she is a servant all the same, since
the servant is always employed for doing a definite work; <em>e.g</em>., the
bath-man, the toilet-man, the cook and so forth; the woman kept for
pleasure also is employed for a definite work,—and is fed and clothed;
and hence she is as good as a servant.</p>
<p>Similarly also in the case of the woman who has already got a son, if
the son is alive, and yet she obtains a son from her younger
brother-in-law, even on ‘authorisation.’</p>
<p>“But how can there be ‘authorisation’ in the ease of a woman who has
already got a son?”</p>
<p>It is the brother-in-law who may be ‘authorised’ for the purposes of
pleasure, under the pretext of begetting a son.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, both of these are ‘born of an adulterer;’ the one
born of a woman who has already got a son is, in addition, also ‘the
product of lust.’ In the case of the former the action is prompted
entirely by a longing for a son, and not by lust.—(143)</p>

<p>‘<em>Like the legitimate, son</em>’;—this has been enjoined here with a view to
permit the ‘preferential share’ ordained for the eldest brother; as no
other ‘equality’ is possible (between the two kinds of sons). What the
present, rule premite is the ‘preferential share’ for the ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’
son born of the eldest wife. To this extent, this is a exception to ‘the
equal shares’ laid down in verse 121. And since both the rules are
equally authoritative, they must he treated as optional
alternatives,—the adoption of the one or the other being dependent upon
the qualifications of the persons concerned. Apart from this there would
be no purpose in this verse; as all that is herein staled has been
already laid down elsewhere.</p>
<p>‘<em>That seed is of the owner of the soil</em>,’—because it serves his
purposes. This is purely commendatory; hence it is added
‘<em>legally</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., according to the law.</p>
<p>Another reason for this lies in the fact that the ‘<em>child</em>’—which is the
visible embodiment of the seed—belongs to the owner of the soil.</p>
<p>This verse is purely declamatory.—(145)</p>

right The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds the following notes.—‘<em>Bibhriyāt</em>’, should

there would be no property belonging separately to the dead brother.</p>

<p>Before ‘<em>niyuktā</em>,’ there should be an ‘<em>a</em>’ (coalescing with the ‘<em>ā</em>’
in ‘<em>yā</em>’); for otherwise (if the word meant ‘authorised’) the present
verse would be contrary to what has gone in the preceding verse. It
might be argued that with ‘<em>aniyuktā</em>,’^(‘)not authorised,’ this would
be a needless repetition of what has gone before. But such superfluity
can be, and has been, explained.</p>
<p>The older writers however do not accept the reading ‘<em>aniyuktā</em>,’ ‘not
authorised.’ And according to them the text is to be explained as
meaning that ‘the son born of the <em>authorised</em> woman also is not
entitled to the paternal property.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Last-born</em>,’— even when the man acts under ‘authority,’ there is
always a certain amount of ‘<em>lust</em>’ involved, hence the child is called
‘lust-born.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Born in vain</em>;’—this means that he is incapable of accomplishing the
purpose for which he was begotten.</p>
<p>This verse turns out (according to the older writers) to be a denial of
the title to inheritance declared before (in 147); and hence an option
has been accepted in this case,</p>
<p>Our revered teacher however declares that if we read ‘<em>aniyuktā</em>,’ ‘not
authorised,’ the two texts become reconciled.—(147)</p>

<p>‘<em>Sons born of the wives of the same caste</em>.’— Sons born of mothers of
the same caste as the father are entitled to inherit the whole property.</p>
<p>‘<em>Born of diverse wives</em>’;—<em>i.e</em>., of wives belonging to diverse castes.</p>
<p>This is what is now going to be expounded.</p>
<p>‘<em>Severed</em>’— this is a mere reiteration.</p>
<p>Others however attach special significance to this epithet (‘several’)
also; the sense being that in the case of partition among sons born of
<em>several</em> wives belonging to diverse castes, the rule is as going to be
set forth (in 153),—<em>viz</em>., ‘The Brāhmaṇa son shall take four shares
etc., etc.’ As for a <em>single</em> wife of a <em>different</em> caste,—no man ever
has recourse to any such; hence she does not count in the present
connection.—(148)</p>

<p>**(verses 9.149-157)<br>
**</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.47-50).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa has issue by wives belonging to
the Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya castes respectively,—the son of the
Brāhmaṇa. wife shall receive three shares; the sou of the Kṣatriya wife,
two shares;—the other sous shall inherit equal shares.’</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata</em> (13.47.4?, 56).—‘Something very good, a bull, a vehicle
that may he the most important,—this shall be taken as a special share
by the son of the Brāhmaṇa mother.’ (57 is the same as Manu 157).</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (8.(?)1-37).—‘If there are four sons of a Brāhmaṇa from wives of
the four castes, they shall divide the entire estate of the father into
ten parts; of these the son of the Brāhmaṇa wife shall take four parts;
the son of the Kṣatriya wife, three parts; the son of the Vaiśya wife,
two parts; the son of the Śūdra wife, a single part. Again, if there are
three sons of a Brāhmaṇa by wives of the first three castes only, they
shall divide the estate into nine parts; of these each shall take, in
the order of his caste, shares amounting to four, three and two parts
respectively. If there are three sons from the Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and
Śūdra wives, they shall divide the estate into equal parts; and take
four, three and one parts respectively. If there are three sons of the
Brāhmaṇa, Vaiśya and Śūdra wives, they shall divide the estate into
seven parts and take four, two, and one parts respctively. If there are
three sons of the Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Shudra wives, they shall divide
the estate into six parts and take three, two and one parts
respectively. If a Kṣatriya has sons by a Kṣatriya, a Vaiśya and a Śūdra
wife, the mode of division shall be the same (<em>i.e</em>., the estate being
divided into six parts etc.). If the Brahmaṇa has two sons, one
belonging to the Brāhmaṇa and another belonging to the Kṣatriya caste,
they shall divide the estate into seven parts; and the Brāhmaṇa shall
take four parts, and the Kṣatriya, three. If there are two sons to a
Brāhmaṇa, one belonging to the Brāhmaṇa and another to the Vaiśya caste,
the estate shall be divided into six parts, the Brāhmaṇa shall take
four, and the Vaiśya, two parts. If there are two sons to a Brāhmaṇa,
one belonging to the Brāhmaṇa and another to the Śūdra caste, the estate
shall be divided into live parts; and the Brahmaṇa shall take four parts
and the Śūdra a single part. If there are two sons to a Brāhmaṇa, or to
a Kṣatriya,—one belonging to the Kṣatriya and another to the Vaiśya
caste,—they shall divide the estate into five parts; the Kṣatriya shall
take three parts and the Vaiśya two parts. If there are two sons to a
Brāhmaṇa, or to a Kṣaṭtriya, one belonging to the Kṣatriya and the other
to the Śūdra caste, they shall divide the estate into four parts; and
the Kṣatriya shall take three parts and the Śūdra, a single part. If
there are two sons to a Brāhmaṇa, or to a Vaiśya or to a Śūdra,—and the
one belongs to the Vaiśya and the other to the Śūdra caste, they shall
divide the estate into three parts,—the Vaiśya taking two parts, and the
Śūdra, one. If a Brāhmaṇa has an only son, he shall take the whole
estate, provided he be a Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya. If the Kṣatriya
has an only son, who is either a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya, the rule shall be
the same. If the Vaiśya has an only son who is a Vaiśya, the rule shall
be the same. The only son of a Śūdra shall be the sole heir to his Śūdra
father. A Śūdra who is the only son of a father of one of the twice-born
castes, shall inherit one half of his property;—the other shall devolve
in the same way as the property of one who dies without issue. Mothers
shall receive shares proportionate to their son’s shares;—and so shall
unmarried daughters. Sons of the same caste as their father shall
receive equal shares;—a best part shall be given to the eldest son as
bis additional share.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.35-40).—‘The son of a Brāhmaṇa by a Kṣatriya wife, being
the eldest and endowed with good qualities, shares equally with a
younger brother born of a Brāhmaṇa mother;—but he shall not receive the
additional share due to the eldest son. If there are sons begotten by a
Brāhmaṇa on wives-of the Kṣatriya and Vaiśya castes, the division
between them shall he in the same way as between the son of a Brāhmaṇa
wife and that of a Kṣatriya wife. Similarly the two sons of a Kṣatriya
born, one from the Kṣatriya and the other from the Vaiśya wife. The son
of even a Śūdra wife,—if he is obedient like a pupil,—receives a
provision for maintenance out of the estate of a Brāhmaṇa deceased
without other male issue. According to some, the son of a woman of even
equal caste does not inherit if he behaves unrighteously.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.125)—‘The sons of the Brāhmaṇa, belonging to the four
castes, shall receive, respectively, four, three, two and one parts of
his estate; the three sons of the Kṣatriya, belonging to the Kṣatriya,
Vaiśya and Śūdra castes, shall receive three, two and one parts;—the two
sons of the Vaiśya, belonging to the Vaiśya and Śūdra castes, shall
receive two and one parts.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 536).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa has no child
except a son born from a Śūdra wife, this son, if obedient, shall
receive a maintenance and the rest of his property shall go to his
Sapiṇḍas.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (Aparārka, p. 732).—That property of the Brāhmaṇa which has
been derived from gifts shall not be inherited by his sons by the
Kṣatriya and other wives; even though the father may have given this to
these latter, the son of the Brāhmaṇa wife shall take it away on his
death.’</p>
<p>Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 533).—‘The son of a Brāhmaṇa born from a
Kṣatriya wife,—if he happen to be the eldest and possessed of good
qualities,—may obtain the same share as the Brāhmaṇa sons; similarly
with the Vaiśya son of a Brāhmaṇa.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 528).—‘Among the sons of the lower castes,
horn of married wives, the shares go on decreasing by one.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Do., p. 531).—‘Among sons born from wives of other
castes, there is a decrease in the inheritance by one half in each
case.’</p>
<p>Do. (p. 536).—‘The son of the Śūdra wife is entitled to inherit
property; whatever his father gives him, that shall be his share.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (Do., p. 532).—‘Between two sons, one born of the wife of
the same caste as the father, the other of a wife of the next lower
caste,—if the latter happens to be possessed of good qualities, he may
obtain the special share of the eldest; or he may even become the master
of the entire property.’</p>

<p>Though the shares of the <em>Kṣatriya</em> and other sons have been set forth
here in an unqualified form, yet in another <em>Smṛti</em>, in connection with
certain particular kinds of property, we find a totally different form
of division:—(1) ‘The land acquired from gifts shall not be given to the
son of the Kṣatriya mother, and (2) if any such land happen to have been
given by the father to these, it shall be taken by the Brāhmaṇa son on
the father’s death.’</p>
<p>Since this specifies the land ‘acquired from gifts,’ that acquired by
purchase and other means do not become similarly excluded. Elsewhere
again we read—‘The son horn to a Brāhmaṇa from his <em>Śūdra</em> wife is not
entitled to a share in landed property,’ which precludes the <em>Śūdra</em> son
from all kinds of lands.</p>
<p>All this restriction should be understood to apply to those cases where
there are other forms of property also; otherwise, we would be faced by
the law relating to ‘the tenth part of a share.’ If there were no other
property, the sons in question would be left without any subsistence.</p>
<p>What I hold however is that though the allotment of shares (under the
circumstances mentioned in the Smṛti texts quoted) is negatived,
provision for subsistence does not thereby become precluded</p>
<p>If it be asked ‘What is the difference between these two?’—our answer is
that if the said sons were entitled to regular ‘shares,’ they would be
entitled to make gifts of, or sell, the property inherited, while what
they get for subsistence, of that they can only take the usufruct.</p>
<p>“As for the grains necessary for his subsistence, these the <em>Śūdra</em> son
shall receive from the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> son; so that there would be no point
in alloting any land to him for that purpose. Says Gautama (28-39)—‘Ho
obtains his subsistence, in the manner of a pupil.”</p>
<p>True; but provision for his subsistence has got to be made, in
consideration of the fact that the property under division is his
father’s; and if such provision were not definitely made at the time of
division, it is just possible that the twice-born brothers might lose
the property, either by misconduct or by some such act as selling and
the like; and in that wise he would be left without subsistence. If, on
the other hand, some land has been definitely allotted for his
subsistence, the other brothers could not appropriate it to other uses,
without his consent.—(153)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 528), which adds that no
significance attaching to the singular number in ‘<em>vipraḥ</em>’ this same
rule applies to cases where there are several sons from the Brāhmaṇī
wife.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 343), which adds that
this pertains to lands other than that which may have been received by
the father as a religious gift, to which latter, the non-Brahmaṇa sons
are not entitled;—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 144);—in
<em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em> (p. 51);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 212).</p>
<p>On the failure of other sons, the rest of the property goes to the
<em>Sapiṇḍas</em> (according to Medhātithi),—to the widow and the rest
(according to Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 535), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Saputraḥ</em>’, one having sons of the twice-born
castes,—‘<em>aputraḥ</em>’, one having no sons of the twice-born
castes;—Halāyudha and Pārijāta have taken this verse to men that no part
of the property goes to such son of the married Śūdra wife as is
entirely devoid of good qualities.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 344), which adds that
this refers to such Śūdra-born sons as are not obedient to the father.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 735), which adds the ‘<em>adhikam</em>’ means
‘more than the tenth share;’—also on p. 740 where it is added that the
implication o&rsquo;f this rule is that in the case of the man ‘without sons,’
the property besides the ‘tenth share,’ which goes to the Śūdra-born
son, goes to the ‘widow and the rest’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣara</em> (2.132-133), which explains the meaning to
be that even though the son of the Śūdra wife is a ‘body-born’ son, yet
he cannot inherit anything more than the tenth share, even when there
are no other sons. It adds the following explanation:—‘<em>Satputraḥ</em>’
means ‘one having sons of wives of the twice-born castes,’—‘<em>aputraḥ</em>,’
‘one who has no sons from the twice-born wives,’—when such a person
dies, then his sons—<em>Kṣetraja</em> and the rest—or <em>sapiṇḍas</em>, shall not
give to his son from the Śūdra wife, any more than the tenth share.—This
implies that the sons of <em>Kṣatriya</em> and <em>Vaiśya</em> wives inherit the
entire property, if there is no son from the Brāhmaṇa wife.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra 35b);—in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 688);—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em></p>
<p>(Vyavahāra 192b) which explains ‘<em>satputra</em>’ as having ‘son born of the
wife of one’s own caste;’ and ‘<em>aputra</em>’ as ‘having no son born of the
wife of one’s own caste, and adds that on the death of such a person,
the Kṣetraja and other sons will inherit his property, but the son born
of Śūdra mother will not get more than the tenth part of the estate:—and
by Jīmūtavāhara (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 219), which says that even in the
absence of a son of a twice-born caste, the Śūdra son shall not get more
than the tenth part.</p>

<p>‘<em>Has a son</em>’—has any son; or the son meant may be that born of the
<em>Brāhmaṇa</em> wife, and not that of any of the^(‘)twice-born’ wives. So
that if there is no son born of the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> wife, even if there
art-sons of <em>Kṣatriya</em> and <em>Vaiśya</em> wives, the son of the <em>Śūdra</em> wife
shall receive the <em>eighth</em> part; while if there is only a son of the
<em>Vaiśya</em> wife, he shall get the <em>third</em> part.</p>
<p>Others, however, explain the phrase ‘no <em>son</em>’ to mean <em>the absence of a
son of any twice-born wife</em>. And according to this view, the residue of
the property left after the tenth part has been marie over to the
<em>Śūdra</em> son shall go to the <em>Sapiṇḍas</em> (Collaterals).</p>
<p>The most unobjectionable principle of division, however, would be as
follows:—If the property is a large one, and there is no son of any
higher caste, the <em>Śūdra</em> son shall receive only the tenth part; if,
however, the property is just enough for the maintenance of a few men
only, then, the whole shall go to the <em>Śūdra</em> son.</p>
<p>In the case of Kṣatriyas and others, another <em>Smṛti</em> has laid down the
following rule in connection with sons born of the same and different
castes:—‘Sons of a Kṣatriya are entitled to three, two and one shares;
those of the Vaiśya to two and one’ (Yājña. 2.125). That is, sons of the
<em>Kṣatriya</em> from the <em>Kṣatriya</em> wife shall each receive three parts,
those from the <em>Vaiśya</em> wife two parts, and from the <em>Śūdra</em> wife one
part; so that <em>Śūdra</em> sons receive the sixth part of the property of the
<em>Kṣatriya</em> father and the third part of the <em>Vaiśya</em> father.</p>
<p>Others again explain the sense of the present text as follows:—When he
is going to give some property to the <em>Śūdra</em> son at all, the father
shall collect the entire property and give to him the tenth part of
it,—even, though he be free to do as he likes; as it is going to be
declared (in the next verse) that ‘whatever his father shall give to
him, that shall be his.’</p>
<p>According to this view, it would be much more reasonable to construe the
text as ‘the man having a son shall give, etc. etc.,’—‘<em>dadyāt</em>,’ ‘shall
give,’ being construed with ‘<em>saputraḥ</em>,’ ‘having a son’; otherwise, the
construction would be—‘the person, whose father has a son or no son,
shall give, etc.,’—which shall be a most difficult one. As in this case,
the term ‘having a son’ shall stand for the dead <em>father</em>, while the
nominative of the verb ‘shall give’ shall be the living son or other
<em>Sapiṇḍa</em> relations.</p>
<p>Thus, then, in a case where there are only <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> and <em>Śūdra</em> sons,
and no <em>Kṣatriya</em> or <em>Vaiśya</em> ones, the <em>Śūdra</em> one is entitled, not to
the tenth part, but to something less, never more.</p>
<p>If there are ten cows, the Brāhmaṇa son shall receive four cows the
Śūdra one cow,—the remaining ones being divided between the <em>Kṣatriya</em>
and <em>Vaiśya</em> sons. When, however, these latter too do not exist, then,
these five cows also shall he divided, on the aforesaid principle,
between the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> and <em>Śūdra</em> sons. When, however, the Brāhmaṇa son
takes the entire property, he cannot be called either a ‘share-holder’
or ‘a receiver of four shares.’ Hence, in this ease what has been said
(in 153) regarding the Brāhmaṇa taking ‘four shares’ would apply to a
case where there are four brothers. The <em>Śūdra</em> also receives the ‘tenth
share’ only when there are four brothers;—this share to be
correspondingly increased if there are two or three brothers only.—(154)</p>

<p>The son born of the <em>Śūdra</em> wife of the twice-born persons is not
an^(‘)inheritor of property.’—Is that so always?—No; ‘<em>whatever</em> <em>his</em>
<em>father may give to him</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., the ‘tenth part’ which the father may
have allotted to him—that shall be his property; and he obtains nothing
more out of his paternal property.</p>
<p>In this connection, it has been declared by Śaṅkha—‘The son of the Śūdra
wife is not entitled to inheritance;—his share consists of whatever his
father gives him; <em>at the time of partition, however, his brothers may
give him a pair of bullocks in addition</em>’;—this latter sentence forming
a subsequent addition.</p>
<p>Others hold that what is said in the present text refers to the son of
the <em>unmarried Śūdra</em> woman;—their argument being that there is nothing
in the text indicative of the woman being one that has been duly
married,—all that the term ‘<em>Śūdra</em>’ denotes is the particular caste.
Hence, the meaning is that for the son of such a woman, ‘<em>whatever the
father gives him</em>,’—that is, the provision that his father makes for his
maintenance, or any share that he may have allotted to him for his
maintenance during his life-time,—that shall be his property,—and his
brothers need not give him anything. Says Gautama in the section dealing
with the son of a <em>Śūdra</em> wife—‘As regards the sons of unmarried wives,
they shall, if they are obedient, receive enough for subsistence, in the
manner of pupils.’ (28—39)</p>
<p>According to the view of these men, however, the sons born of unmarried
<em>Kṣatriya</em> and <em>Vaiśya</em> wives would be entitled to inheritance; and it
is not known to what share these would be entitled.</p>
<p>It might be asserted that—“Their share shall be the same as that of the
sons of married wives; since there is no word, either directly or
indirectly indicative of the fact that the mothers shall be <em>married</em>
wives. For all that is said is that—‘the legitimate son alone shall
inherit the property’ (163); which distinctly mentions the ‘legitimate’
son, born of the legally married wife <em>↓</em> and the qualities of the
‘legitimate’ son can never be present in those born of <em>unmarried</em>
wives, and further, it has been declared that ‘the son of the
unauthorised woman&hellip;&hellip; is not entitled to any share’ (143). It might
be urged that this last passage refers to the <em>brothers wife</em>; as it is
only in connection with her that ‘authorisation’ has been sanctioned; so
that when the text used the term ‘unauthorised’ it must be taken as
referring to her alone.”</p>
<p>But in the present case also, there is dear indication of the fact that
sons become entitled to ‘subsistence’ as soon as they are born
(irrespectively of all other conditions). Hence, the term ‘unauthorised’
also refers in general to the wives of other persons. And all these sons
(of married or unmarried wives) are entitled to subsistence.—(155)</p>

<p>“The son of a Śūdra wife receives no share of his father’s estate in
case the mother was not legally married’ (Medhātithi; ‘others,’ in
Kullūka),—or in case he is destitute of good qualities (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda). According to Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa ‘<em>na rikthabhāk</em>’
means ‘receives no larger share than one-tenth, except if the father has
given more to him.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 535), which adds the
following notes:—‘According to <em>Lakṣmīdhara</em> the meaning is that ‘if the
father gives anything to the son of his Śūdra wife, he should give only
the tenth part of his property’;—Halāyudha and Pārijāta hold that the
verse denies all share to the son of the Śūdra mother who is not a
married wife.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 343); which adds that
this refers only to such property as may be given by way of an
affectionate present; and hence there is no incompatibility with those
texts that deny to the said son any part of the landed property.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 735), which notes that this debarring
from inheritance is meant for those cases where the son in question has
already received some affectionate presents from the father;—or that the
verse may be taken to mean that the son is not entitled to anything more
than the tenth share of the property.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 45) as debarring from all
inheritance the son of a <em>śūdra</em> mother, who is not a legally married
wife;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 219), which says that this
denial of heritance refers only to those cases where the śūdra son has
already got the tenth part of the father’s property, during the latter’s
life-time, through his favour.</p>

<p>In the absence of any other alternative, (he term ‘or’ can be explained
only as referring to what is here stated.</p>
<p>Whether the wives belong to the same caste or to different castes, it is
only the <em>Śūdra</em> son that has been precluded from inheriting the entire
property; hence, what is asserted here must be understood to apply to
<em>twice-born</em> sons only. Consequently, the sense is that if a <em>Brāhmaṇa</em>
has no son born of his <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> wife, his sons horn of the other
wives, inherit his entire property. Similarly, the son of the <em>Vaiśya</em>
wife of the Kṣatriya father.</p>
<p>The text cannot mean that ‘after the preferential share has been given
to the eldest brother, all the sons born of wives of different castes
shall divide <em>equally</em>,—with those born of the wives of the same caste.’
As this would he contrary to what has been said before (in 153)
regarding each son of the lower caste receiving one share less than that
of the higher caste.</p>
<p>It has been argued that—“This equality would be right in a case where
the sons of the wife of the same caste are devoid of qualities, while
those of the lower castes are duly qualified; specially in view of what
has been declared by Gautama (28.40)—according to same people, a son of
the wife of the same caste does not inherit, if he is misbehaved.”</p>
<p>This, however, is not right. Because, the caste of the son is the most
important consideration. In fact, the revered teachers have declared
that as soon as the son (of the wife of the same caste) has been born,
he becomes the owner of the entire property.</p>
<p>Thus, the rule on this subject should be as that when there are no sons
of the wife of the same caste, oven those sons that are born of wives of
different, castes should give to the eldest brother of the same caste as
themselves, his preferential share and divide the rest equally.—(156)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 532), which adds the
following explanation:—In cases where twice-born men have many sons from
several wives of the same caste as themselves ,—<em>or</em> (as indicated by
the term ‘<em>vā</em>’) many sons from several wives of diverse castes,—the
sons shall divide the property equally after having given something to
the eldest brother as his ‘additional share.’</p>

<p>This is a brief indication of what follows.</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>bandhu</em>’ stands for ‘<em>bāndhava</em>,’ ‘kinsman.’ Six inherit the
man’s ‘family-name’ as well as ‘property’; while with the remaining six,
the ease is the reverse of this.</p>
<p>What the true view is regarding this point, we shall explain later
on.—(158)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 549), which adds that the
diversity of opinion on this question among the various Smṛtis—as
regards the exclusion or inclusion of certain kinds of sons—is to be
explained as based upon consideration of the qualifications of the
sons;—in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 552, 666 and 687);—in
<em>Dattakacandrikā</em> (p. 61);—and in <em>Vīvādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 147).</p>
<p>Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana take the latter half to mean that the
six sons are neither <em>bandhu</em> (<em>kinsmen</em>) nor <em>dāyāda</em> (<em>heir</em>); Kullūka
says that this explanation would be against the declaration of
Baudhāyana;—Nārāyaṇa goes on to explain ‘<em>bandhudāyāda</em>’ as ‘heir to the
kinsmen, <em>i.e</em>., inheritors of the estates of kinsmen, such as paternal
uncles, on failure of sons and wives of these latter.’</p>

<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (2.3.31-32).—‘They quote the following verses: “The
Body-born son, the son of an Appointed Daughter, the son begotten on a
wife through another man, the adopted son and the appointed son, the son
horn secretly,</p>
<p>and the son cast off are entitled to share the inheritance. The son of
an unmarried damsel, the son of a pregnant bride, the son bought, the
son of a re-married woman, the son self-given and the Niṣāda are only
members of the family.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.32-33).—‘The Body-born son, the son begotten on a wife
through another man, the adopted son, the appointed son, the son born
secretly, and the son cast off are inheritors of property. The son of an
unmarried damsel, the son of a pregnant bride, the son of a re-married
womans the son of an Appointed Daughter, the son self-given, and the son
bought belong to the family;—these latter are entitled to one-fourth of
a share, in the absence of the former six sons.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.25-39).—‘They declare that, these six sons (Body-born,
begotten on the wife through another man. the Appointed Daughter, son of
a re-married woman, the son of an unmarried damsel, and the son secretly
born) are heirs as well as kinsmen, preservers from great danger. Among
those who are only kinsmen, not heirs are—one received with the pregnant
bride, the adopted son, the son bought, the son sell-given, the son cast
off, and the son of a Śūdra woman. They declare that the last-mentioned
six sons shall take the heritage of him who has no heir belonging to the
first six classes.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.132).—‘Among the twelve kinds of sons, the one
succeeding inherits the property and offers the B?? only in the absence
of the preceeding.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p.??4).—‘The son cast off, the son
born of the pregnant bride, the son adopted, the son bought, the son of
the Śūdra wife, the son s??? given,—those six are non-inheritors;—among
the six sons that are inheritors—<em>viz</em>., the Body-born son, the son
begotten on the wife by another man, the son of the Appointed Daughter,
the son of the remarried woman, the son born of an unmarried damsel, the
son born secretly, there is an apportionment of shares;—two parts going
to the father, two to the Body-horn son, and one each to the rest.’</p>
<p><em>Hārīta</em> (<em>Do</em>.).—‘Six of the sons are both kinsmen and
inheritors—<em>viz</em>., one begotten by oneself on a righteous wife, one
begotten by one’s wife through another man, the son of a remarried
woman, the son of an unmarried damsel, the son of an Appointed Daughter,
and the son secretly born. The son adopted, the son bought, the son cast
off, the son horn of a pregnant bride, the son self-given and the son
found by chance are inheritors, not kinsmen.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Do., p. 550).—‘These twelve sons have been declared to serve
the purpose of perpetuating one’s line,—they being born of one’s own
body, or of others, or found by chance;—of these, the first six are
kinsmen as well as inheritors of the father. All these inherit the
father’s property, in the absence of a Body-born son.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Do., p. 551).—‘The Body-born son, the son begotten on one’s
wife through another man, the son of an Appointed Daughter, the son of
the unmarried damsel, the son born of a pregnant bride, the son secretly
born, the son of the remarried woman, the son east off, the son adopted,
the son bought, the son appointed, the son self-given,—these are the

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em>, (Prāyaścitta, p. 37);—in
<em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 349), where it is added that though the
sons have been divided into these two sets, yet the duty that devolves
upon them, as ‘<em>sapiṇḍas</em>’ or ‘<em>sagotras</em>,’ devolves equally on all the
twelve,—such as the offering of water and so forth;—and as for
inheriting the father’s property, the latter set also are entitled to
it, in the absence of the former set</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em>, (p. 549);—and in <em>Mitākṣarā</em>,
(2.132), which has the following notes:—The implication of this is that,
in the case of the death also of the <em>Sapiṇḍa</em> or the <em>Samānadaka</em> of
the father, the property goes to the first set of six sons and not to
the second; though the duty of offering water and so forth devolves
equally upon both sets. The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds that from the last remark
it follows that the compound ‘<em>adāyādabāndhavāḥ</em>’ is to be expounded as

<p>The ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ and other sons having been mentioned along with the
‘legitimate’ son, people might think that all of them stand on the same
footing; it is with a view to set aside this notion that the author adds
this verse. The sense is that the ‘Kṣetraja’ and other ‘bad sons’ are
not capable of rendering the same assistance that is rendered by the
‘legitimate’ son.</p>
<p>Even though the text does not mention anything definite, yet people have
explained it to mean this, on the basis of the context. Others, however,
have explained the ‘bad sons’ to mean ‘sons of unauthorised women.’</p>
<p>The sense is that even though people have these ‘had sons,’ they should
not regard themselves as having sons, they should still continue to make
efforts to obtain a ‘legitimate’ son.</p>

<p>An impotent man having obtained a son from his ‘authorised’ wife through
another man, according to the method described under 167, may happen to
have his impotence cured by medicines and then himself beget his own
‘legitimate,’ ‘body-born’ son; and in this ease, the former son would
receive the property of his <em>progenitor</em>, who may be called his ‘father’
on the ground of his being the cause of his birth; and on the same
ground the child would be called his ‘son’ only figuratively; since in
reality he is the ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ son of the other man, just as he is
referred to in this verse.</p>
<p>If, however, the progenitor happens to have a ‘legitimate’ son of his
own,—and if the father, moved by his great love, does not happen to have
made over all his property to that son,—and further, if there are no
other Sapiṇḍa relations—under such circumstances, the ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>;’ son
may inherit the property of that progenitor. The sons of ‘unauthorised’
women also inherit the property of their progenitor, if there are no
‘Sapiṇḍa’ relations.</p>
<p>Others explain the verse to mean as follows:—While the rightful ‘heir’
is already there, if a ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ son happen also to be bora, this
latter shall inherit the property of his progenitor, and not that of the
‘owner of the soil’ (his mother’s husband),—if there is a ‘legitimate’
son of the latter. In the presence of the legitimate son, what the share
of the ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ son shall be is laid down in verses 165 and 164.</p>
<p>The next two verses show how the two sons become entitled to the same
property.—(162)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>Medhātithi has been mis-represented here by Kullūka and also by Buhler.
(See text). Nārāyaṇa and Nandana hold that the rule refers to the case
of two undivided brothers, where one having died, the other, who has
sons of his own, begets on the other a <em>Kṣetraja</em> son; in which case on
the death of the second brother, the <em>Kṣetraja</em> is entitled to receive
only the share of his mother’s husband, not any in the estate of his
natural father.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 543), which has the
following notes:—The ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ meant here is one begotten by one not
‘commissioned’ (by the elders);—‘<em>paitṛkam riktham</em>’ means ‘that
property which the father gave to the mother for the purpose of
maintaining the son.’ Others however construe the verse as it stands, in
the direct, sense—‘Each takes the property of his own father.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em>, (p. 739), as laying down that the
<em>Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa-Kṣetraja</em> is entitled to inherit the property of his
progenitor-father.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, (p. 169), which explains the meaning to
be that each is to take the property of the man from whose seed he was
born;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 229), which says that the son
shall inherit the property of that person from whose ‘seed’ he may he
horn.</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.132), which notes that this rule
is meant for those cases where the ‘adopted’ and other ‘secondary’ sons

notes:—‘<em>ānṛśaṃsya</em>’ means ‘avoidance of sin’; so that the meaning is
that if maintenance is not provided, sin is incurred.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 542), which has the following
notes:—‘<em>Śeṣāṇām</em>’, those precluded from inheritance;—‘<em>ānṛśaṃsya</em>’ is
pity,—‘<em>prajīvanam</em>’, maintenance;—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p.

‘body-born’ son, it does not really preclude the fourth share for the
other sons;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, 40a);—</p>

<p>It being possible for men to entertain the notion that, like the
‘bought’ son, the ‘<em>Kṣetraja</em>’ (‘soil-born’) son also is entitled to
subsistence only,—the text lays down the optional alternative that he
may receive a share out of the property. What the exact share shall be
shall depend upon the man’s qualifications.—(164)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This rule refers to the case where the <em>Kṣetraja</em> was born before the
‘body-bom’ son, and received no property from his progenitor-father
(Rāghavānanda);—It refers to the case where a man dying leaving several
widows, one of those is ‘commissioned’ to bear a son, while another
gives birth to a ‘body-born’ son (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 543), which adds that the
option of ‘fifth’ and ‘sixth’ share is meant to be determined by the
presence or absence of good qualifications in the <em>Kṣetraja</em> son
concerned;—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 348), which deduces the
following conclusion:—If the <em>Kṣetraja</em> son is endowed with
exceptionally good qualifications, he receives a fourth share; if he is
devoid of good qualities and also unfriendly to the ‘body-born’ son,
then only a sixth share; if he is only devoid of qualities, but not
unfriendly,—or if is he unfriendly but not devoid of qualities,—then a
fifth share,—and by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyahhāga</em>, p. 229).</p>

<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (see above under 163).</p>
<p>Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 545).—‘The son begotten on one’s wife through
other men, and the other sons are entitled to five, six and seven
parts.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 544).—‘When the body-born son is born,
the other sons belonging to the same caste as the father obtain a third
part of the estate; those belonging to other castes are entitled only to
food and clothing.’</p>
<p><em>Hārīta</em> (Do., p. 545).—‘When dividing the property, one should give to
the son born of the unmarried damsel, the twenty-first part, the
twentieth part to the son of the remarried woman, the nineteenth to the
son of two fathers (<em>i.e</em>., the secretly born son), the eighteenth to
the son begotten on one’s wife through another man, the seventeenth to
the son of the apppointed daughter, and the other sixteen parts to the
body-born son.’</p>
<p><em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> (Do.).—‘The body-born son even when low-born is entitled
to the entire property; the son begotten on one’s wife by another man
takes the third part, the son of the appointed daughter takes the
fourth, the appointed son takes the fifth, the secretly-born son takes
the sixth, the son cast off takes the seventh part, the son born of the
unmarried damsel takes the eighth, the son horn of the pregnant bride
takes the ninth, the bought sou takes the tenth, the son horn of the
remarried woman takes the eleventh, the self-given son takes the
twelfth, and the Śūdra son takes the thirteenth part of the father’s
estate.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhīta</em> (Do., p. 547).—‘The estate shall be divided into ten

<p>The first half of this verse is only a reiteration of what has been
enjoined before, and not a distinct injunction; specially because the
‘soil-born’ son does not stand on an equal footing with the ‘body-born’
son.</p>
<p>The other sons inherit the ‘family name,’ and they inherit also ‘<em>a
share in the property</em>;’ and it has been already explained that this
‘share’ consists of <em>mere subsistence</em>. But the case of the ‘adopted’
son stands on the same footing as that of the ‘soil-born’ one. In
support of this view people quote other <em>Smṛti-texts</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>According to their order</em>.’— The ‘body-born’ and the ‘soil-born’ sons
are entitled to inherit simultaneously; but among the rest, the
succeeding one inherits only in the absence of the preceding one.</p>
<p>“If only six of the sons are ‘heirs,’ and the other six are <em>not</em>
heirs,—according to the distinction into ‘heirs’ and ‘non-heirs’ made
(in 158), it cannot be right to declare all these to be <em>inheritors</em> of
property.”</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, those that have been described as ‘non-heirs’ are
so only in the presence of the ‘body-born’ son; all that is meant by the
distinction is that the first six are larger beneficiaries than the
second six.</p>
<p>Among the first group, all except the ‘body-born’ are equal
beneficiaries, and less than these latter are the six in the second
group; these latter are all equal, and there is no difference among
themselves, due to these being mentioned earlier or latter.—(165)</p>

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>The term ‘<em>own</em>’ here denotes <em>ownership</em>, and not <em>the character of
belonging to the same caste</em>. Thus, the meaning is that the ‘body-born’
son is one born from the woman ‘<em>sanctified</em>’ (married) by the man
himself. If this were not meant by ‘own,’ then the epithet
‘<em>sanctified</em>’ would only exclude the <em>unmarried</em> woman; so that the son
begotten on a woman <em>married</em> by another person would also come to be
known as one’s ‘body-born’ son. And further, if the word is interpreted
as we have pointed out, the sons of the <em>Kṣatriya</em> wife also would be
‘body-born’ (for the Brāhmaṇa father); these latter do not fall within
any other class of sons.’ Others take the epithet ‘<em>prathamakalpitam</em>’
as qualifying ‘body-born’ [and meaning ‘of the principal kind’], and
hold that the sons born of the <em>Kṣatriya</em> wife are not ‘body-born’ in
the fuller sense.</p>
<p>Under this explanation, however, as the son begotten on one’s own
<em>married</em> wife would not be ‘body-born’ in the full sense, he would be
as good as born of an <em>unmarried</em> wife And even if the sons of the
<em>Kṣatriya</em> and other wives are not called ‘body-born,’ what does it
matter? They still remain the man’s ‘sons’ and entitled to inherit their
limited shares in his property.</p>
<p>The following argument might be put forward—“If the son in question does
not fulfill the conditions of the ‘body-born,’ the ‘soil-born,’ or any
of the twelve kinds of sons,—and there are only these <em>twelve</em> kinds of
sons,—how can he be regarded as a ‘son’ at all?”</p>
<p>The answer to this is as follows:—What is the use of any definitions?
The application of the same depends upon actual usage. As a rule, when a
child is born of a man, he is called his ‘son’; and obviously, if the
child is not born of a man, they do not regard that man to be his
‘father’; and they tell him—‘this is not your father, you are not born
of him.’ From these two affirmative and negative propositions, it
follows that the progenitor is the ‘father’ and the person born is the
‘son;’ and it is only for the purpose of indicating the peculiar
characteristics that definitions are set forth. In the case of the
‘soil-born’ son, it is true that the person called his ‘father’ is not
his progenitor; but that is only with a view to a special purpose; the
child being called the man’s ‘son,’ for, even though not his ‘son,’ he
fulfills for him the functions of a son.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the mere fact of a person being born of a man does
not make him his ‘son’; as this has been expressly denied. It is for
this reason that such sons have been called ‘substitutes’ (in 180).
Further, if the mere fact of being born of a man were to make one his
‘son,’ then there would be no difference in the ‘sonship’ of the
‘body-born son,’ ‘the son born of a remarried woman’ and ‘the son of an
unauthorized woman,’ since the fact of being born is common to all of
them. Then again, if the mere fact of <em>serving the purposes of a son</em>
were the sole condition of one being a ‘son,’ then no one in the world
would be ‘sonless.’ As regards the common usage (regarding the use of
the name ‘son’) mentioned above, it cannot he regarded as universally
true, since it is found that in many cases the name ‘father’ is not
applied to the actual <em>progenitor</em>.</p>
<p>Thus then, notwithstanding ordinary usage, the actual application of the
name ‘son’—as in the case of such titles as ‘wife’ and the like—should
be determined by the scriptural texts, which lay down the various ways
in which a ‘son’ may he begotten; and it is only the signification of
the names that may be learnt from ordinary usage; just as in the ease of
such titles as ‘Indra’ and the like.</p>
<p>“But as regards the declaration that the ‘body-born’ son is ‘<em>the first
in order</em>,’ it is ordinary usage on which this is based.”</p>
<p>Not only on ordinary usage, but also upon the nature of the benefits
(conferred by this particular kind of son);—the meaning of the
declaration being that ‘the body-born son is in a position to confer the
greatest benefits upon his fathers.’ Thus, the other sons are called
‘substitutes’ only on the ground of the lessening degrees of benefits
conferred by them. As a matter of fact, however, these other sons cannot
be ‘substitutes’ in the real sense of the term; because, it is only when
a substance is used as a subsidiary accessory in the completing of an
act already begun with a certain substance (which is no longer
found)—that the former substance comes to be called a ‘substitute;’ in
the case in question however, the son is not the ‘subsidiary accessory’
of any act, the act of begetting the son being itself only a subsidiary
act Hence, what is meant by calling the other sons, ‘substitutes’ is
that though the ‘soil-born’ and others are also ‘sons,’ it is the
‘body-born’ one that is most praiseworthy; just as we find in the Vedic
passage—‘The cow and the horse are the only cattle, animals other than
the cow and the horse are not <em>cattle</em>,’—where the assertion that the
other animals are not ‘cattle’ means that the cow and the ‘horse are
praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Further, it has been shown in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> that sons do not always
belong to the person from whose seed they are born: <em>e.g</em>., Pāṇḍu,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Vidura, though born from the seed of Vyāsa, are not
spoken of as ‘sons’ of Vyāsa.</p>
<p>It has already been explained by us what useful purpose is served by our
regarding as ‘body-bom’ or ‘legitimate,’ the sons of the <em>Kṣatriya</em> and
other wives also.</p>
<p>“As regards the ‘son of the Appointed Daughter,’ if this were regarded
as a ‘son,’ the number of sons would exceed <em>twelve</em>.”</p>
<p>What is the harm if it does? This may be the <em>thirteenth</em> kind of son.
In fact, he has not been separately mentioned, because, the useful
purpose served by him is the same as that by the ‘body-born’ son, which
fact makes him equal to this latter. That is why another Smṛti text has
declared—‘Equal to him (the Body-born son) is the son of the Appointed
Daughter.’ (<em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 2.128).—(166)</p>

<p>It would be more reasonable to read ‘<em>ca</em>’ ‘and,’ instead of ‘<em>vā</em>,’
‘or’—‘The father <em>and</em> the mother’; the child belongs to both the
parents, and cannot be given away, if either of them is unwilling.</p>
<p>Or, we may accept the reading ‘<em>vā</em>’ ‘or’; according to another text,
which says—‘The father or the mother may give the child’; but when the
father is spoken of as the <em>superior</em> of the two parents, this
<em>superiority</em> pertains to other matters.</p>
<p>“Since there is the mother’s ownership also over the child, the father
cannot have the sole right to give away the son.”</p>
<p>True; but there are texts declaring that in the absence of the parents
(?) the child belongs to the owner of the seed. It is for this reason
that the ‘father’ has been mentioned. Vaśiṣṭha also has declared—“The
woman shall neither give away nor adopt a son.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Worthy</em>’;—this refers, not to <em>caste</em>, but to the presence of
qualifications in conformity with the family concerned. Thus, it is that
the Brāhmaṇa can adopt sons of the <em>Kṣatriya</em> and other castes also.</p>
<p>‘<em>Affectionately</em>.’—This has been added with a view to preclude <em>greed</em>
and such motives for the giving away of the child.—(168)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>‘<em>Sadṛśam</em>’.—‘Equal by virtue, not by caste’ (Medhātithi);—‘Equal by
caste’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda and Nandana).</p>
<p>‘<em>Mātā pitā ca</em>’.—‘Mother and father, mutually agreeing’
(Kullūka),—‘mother, if there is no father’ (Rāghavā-nanda).</p>
<p>‘<em>Prītisamyuktam</em>’—‘Affectionately, not out of greed’ (Medhātithi);—‘not
out of fear and so forth’ (Kullūka and Nandana);—‘not by force or fraud’
(Rāghavānanda).</p>
<p>‘<em>Āpadi</em>’.—‘If the adopter has no son’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘if
the adoptee’s parents are in distress’ (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Madnapārijāta</em> (p. 652), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Sadṛśam</em> of the same caste; if the father is dead or
gone to foreign lands, and the mother finds herself in distress, she is
by herself, entitled to ‘give away’ the son; similarly if the mother
happens to be insane or dead, the father, by himself, is entitled to
give him away; in other cases the child can be given away only by the
consent of both parents;—the addition of the term ‘<em>āpadi</em>’ means that
no son can be given away in normal times; if he be given in normal
times, the sin of it falls upon the giver, not the receiver, of the son.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.132), which adds that no son should be
given under normal conditions,—this being a prohibition meant for the
<em>giver, not for the adopter</em> (adds the <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em>), who therefore
incurs no sin;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 188b).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 224), which adds the
following notes—‘<em>Āpadi</em>’, during a famine and so forth;—if the child is
given in normal times, the sin lies on the giver;—or it may refer to the
adopter, in which case ‘<em>āpadi</em>’ will mean ‘when he has no son’,—also on
p. 211, where ‘<em>sadṛśam</em>’ is explained as ‘of the same caste’;—it
rejects the view of Medhātithi that the Ksattriya can be adopted by the
Brāhmaṇa, and also that of the <em>Kafpataru</em> that the Brāhmaṇa can adopt a
Śūdra, on account of their being opposed to Śaunaka, Gautama and
Yājñavalkya.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 736), which adds the. following
notes:—‘<em>Adbhiḥ</em>’ stands for all those details that accompany
gifts;—‘<em>āpadi</em>’, during a famine and so forth;—or ‘<em>āpadi</em>’ may refer
to the <em>adopter</em>, in which case it will mean ‘in the event of his having
no son’;—‘<em>sadṛśam</em>’, of the same caste as the giver and the
adopter;—‘<em>prītisamyuktan</em>’, not moved by fear, or any such motive.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Nirṇayasindhu</em> (p. 176);—in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 567),
which adds the following notes—‘<em>Āpadi</em>’, when the adopter has no
son;—‘<em>sadṛśam</em>’, of the same caste; but Medhātithi holds that the
‘equality’ is in <em>qualities</em>, not in caste;—‘<em>prītisamyuktam</em>’, free
from all fear and such other motives;—and in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 47),
which reads ‘<em>vā</em>’ (for ‘<em>ca</em>’) and remarks that in the absence of the
mother, the father alone may give away the son, or the mother may do it
in the absence of the father; it goes on to controvert Vijñāneśvara’s
view that the sin of giving away the son in <em>normal</em> times accrues to
the <em>giver</em>, not to the <em>adopter</em>;—‘<em>Sadṛśam</em>’, equal in family-status
and other qualifications, says Medhātithi; hence according to him the
<em>Kṣatriya</em> also may be adopted by the Brāhmaṇa. But it prefers the view
of Kullūka by which ‘<em>sadṛśam</em>’ means ‘of equal caste’.</p>
<p>This is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 557 and 692);—in <em>Dattakacandrīkā</em> (p. 48),
which explains ‘<em>āpadi</em>’ as ‘when the adopter has no son’,—and
‘<em>Sadṛśam</em>’ as ‘belonging to the same caste,’—it notes Medhātithi’s
opinion that ‘<em>Sadṛśam</em>’ means ‘possessed of equalities in keeping with
the traditions of the family,’ and hence even a Kṣatriya could be
adopted by the Brāhmaṇa, and adds that what this means is that ‘when the
Brāhmaṇa, has a <em>body-born</em> son, his other sons of the Kṣatriya and
other castes, even though not entitled to the offering of Balls and
water, yet for purposes of perpetuating his name, they serve the
purposes of a <em>son</em>’;—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra 38a—and Śrāddha
4a);—in <em>Kṛtyasārasamuccaya</em> (p. 73), which explains ‘<em>adbhiḥ</em>’ as
‘water’ and notes that it includes <em>Tila</em> and the other ingredients
also,—it explains ‘<em>sadṛśam</em>’ as ‘of the same caste’, and ‘<em>āpadi</em>’ as
‘in the event of the adopter having no son’,—it adds that
‘<em>Prītisamyuktam</em>’ (which is its reading for ‘<em>prītisamyuktam</em>’) means
that the father or mother should make over the child through love and
not through fear or covetousness;—and in <em>Dattakamīmānsā</em>’ (p. 9 and
20), which explains ‘<em>āpadi</em>’ as ‘during a famine or some such times of
distress’,—and adds that if the parents give away the child during
normal times, they incur sin.</p>

<p>Here also the epithet ‘<em>worthy</em>’ refers to <em>qualities</em>.</p>
<p>Some people, however, explain it to mean ‘belonging to the same caste’;
b ut if this were meant by the author, the proper. reading would have
been ‘<em>sajātīyam</em>’ (in place of ‘<em>sadṛśantu</em>’). And we have already
pointed out above that the ‘worthiness’ meant in the present context is
not with reference to <em>caste</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>Capable of discerning right and wrong</em>.’—Some people have explained
this to mean that no one shall be so ‘appointed’ until he has attained
his majority; sis until then he is not in a position to discern right
and wrong; all that he knows is that he is the ‘son’ of the man who has
begotten him and who is maintaining him at the time. So that he would
not be able to realise his ‘appointment’ as the son of any other man.
For this reason, the ‘appointment’ should be made only when he is able
to understand his position.</p>
<p>In reality, however, there is no difference between the two cases.

<p>A child may be deserted by the parents, either because they have many
children whom they are unable to support by reason of poverty, or
because the particular child has some such defect as disaffection
towards his parents and the like.</p>
<p>But the child should not have been openly deserted; as in that case it
would not be entitled to being received as a son,—as has been shown
elsewhere.</p>
<p>This desertion may be by either one of the parents.</p>

abandoned by the parents for some cause, other than his having become an
‘outcast—and in the <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 571), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Utsṛṣṭam</em>’, abandoned,—for some such reason as extreme poverty
and consequent incapability to maintain him, or the presence of some
defect in him; the acceptance also by the receiver should be for the

<p>“Rāghavānada, relying on Yājñavalkya 2.130, thinks that the word ‘<em>vā</em>’
at the end of the first half-verse, permits the insertion of ‘or not a
virgin.’”—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 96), which adds the following
explanation:—If, on the death of her flawless husband,—or even during
the life-time of a husband who is either impotent or insane or
out-cast,—a woman has recourse to a second man, that man is called her
‘<em>paunarbhava</em>’ husband, and the woman who is formally married to such a
husband is called ‘<em>punarbhūḥ</em>’; or the meaning may be that if a woman
abandons the husband of her youth,—who has no defects and is fully
capable of maintaining her,—and has sexual intercourse with another man,
but returns again to her former husband, she is ‘<em>gatapratyāgatā</em>’ and
also ‘<em>kṣatayoni</em>’; and the husband (deserted and resumed) is
‘<em>paunarbhava</em>’.—Both these kinds of the ‘<em>paunarbhava</em>’ are described
by Vaśiṣṭha.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 740) to the effect that
re-marriage is permitted only so long as the girl is still
‘<em>akṣatayoni</em>’, ‘virgin’. It adds the following notes:—If the virgin
here described marries again, it is the second husband that is called
‘<em>paunarbhava</em>’; and it is this man, and his sons, that are excluded
from <em>śrāddhas</em> and <em>gifts</em> etc.; the name cannot apply to the former
(deserted) husband or his sons. Though the woman being ‘<em>punarbhūḥ</em>’,
both the husbands, being related to her, are liable to the title
‘<em>paunarbhava</em>’ (‘related to the Punarbhū’), yet the most reasonable
view appears to be to apply the title to that particular husband by
virtue of whose connection the woman herself becomes ‘<em>punarbhū’.
Aparārka</em> has applied the title to both the husbands; but this view
becomes annulled by the above considerations. Though in the explanation
provided by us, there would appear to be no distinction made as to
whether the <em>gatapratyāgatā</em> girl is or is not still a <em>virgin</em>, yet
both Nārāyaṇa and Medhātithi have held that the epithet ‘<em>akṣatayoniḥ</em>’,
‘<em>virgin</em>’, is meant to be construed with the ‘<em>gatapratyāgatā</em>’ also.
And this is the correct view.</p>

<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (4.1.15-16).—‘If a damsel has been abducted by force, and

consummated, she may be married again.’</p>

<p>In the case of a Śūdra, the child born from an unmarried woman, or from
an unauthorised woman, is a ‘son.’ From the text, it is clear that if a
slave were to beget a child upon a female slave belonging to another
slave, that child would belong to the former, and not to the latter.</p>
<p>‘<em>When permitted</em>’—by his father—‘<em>shall receive a share</em>’—equal to that
of the ‘legitimate’ son; when the partition is done during the father’s
life-time, or when the father has declared to his sons that ‘this child
is entitled to a share equal to yours.’</p>
<p>If, however, the father does not permit it, what should he done has been
declared in another <em>Smṛti</em>—‘The son born to a Śūdra from a female slave
shall receive a share according to the wish—[of his father, <em>i.e</em>., as
much as his father permits him to take],—<em>but on the fathers death, his
brothers shall allot to him a half-share</em>; [that is, they shall give
him half of their own share; if they themselves take two shares each,
they shall give him one];—if he has no brothers, he shall take the
entire property, except when there are daughter’s sons;—<em>i.e</em>., in the
absence of ‘legitimate’ sons, he shall inherit the whole property, but
only if there is no daughter’s son; if the daughter’s son is there, this
latter shall be treated like a ‘legitimate’ son; because, nothing else
is mentioned in connection with the daughter’s son, and it is he that is
presented to the mind by the context.</p>
<p>In the case of the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> and other castes, the sons of slave-girls
are entitled to mere subsistence.</p>
<p>Such is the law.—(179)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 537), which adds the note
that the son meant is born to a slave from a slave-girl not married to
him;—the <em>Kalpataru</em> holds that the son meant is that born from the
slave-girl belonging to a personal servant;—in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em>
(p. 566);—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 38a);—and by Jīmūtavāhana

<p>‘<em>Substitute</em>’—when the ‘principal’ is not there; which means that these
other sons are to be taken only in the absence of the ‘legitimate’ son.</p>
<p>In other <em>Smṛtis</em>, these sons have been mentioned in a different order;
<em>e.g</em>., the ‘secretly born’ occupies the fifth place in one text, while
the sixth in another. But no significance attaches to the order in which
these? are mentioned; this is what is indicated by the fact that there
is no uniform order adopted by the <em>Smṛtis</em>. Even though no special
significance attaches to the order, yet a distinctly useful purpose is
served by it; as we shall explain later on.</p>
<p>These sons are taken ‘<em>with a view to</em>’— on account of—‘<em>the failure of
a religious duty</em>’; <em>i.e</em>., with a view to prevent the transgression of
the injunction that ‘one shall beget a child.’ This injunction is an
obligatory one, and as such, must, be acted up to by the Householder.
The principal method of doing this consists in begetting a ‘legitimate’
son; but in the absence of that, he may have recourse to the others here
described.—(180)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>“These substitutes are not to be taken if there is a ‘body-born’ son
(Medhātithi),—or an ‘appointed daughter’ (Kullūka).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 574), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Putrapratinidhīn</em>,’ ‘substitutes of the Body-born Son
and the Appointed Daughter’,—they perform the necessary functions only
in the absence of these two;—the reason for this is supplied by the term
‘<em>Kriyālopāt</em>’—which means ‘on account of the risk of transgressing the
injunction that one should beget children’;—the injunction is an
obligatory one; and as such has to be obeyed by some means or the other;
hence when the primary method of having children fails, one must have
recourse to the secondary method of having substitutes.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, II, (p. 262), to the effect that the name
‘son’ is applied to the substitutes only figuratively;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p.
97);—in <em>Mitākṣarā</em>, (3.259), to the effect that the substitutes are not
really sons, they are so called because they perform the functions of
the son;—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 207), which notes that those
‘sons’ whose bodies are made up of the constituents of the body of one
of the two parents,—<em>e.g</em>. the ‘Kṣetraja,’ ‘Gūḍhaja,’ ‘Kānīvn’
‘Paunarbhava’ and ‘Sahoḍha’—are called ‘substitutes because the
constituents of the body of the other parent are wanting’;—and in the
case of the Appointed Daughter, even though her body is made up of the
constituents of the bodies of both parents, and as such she would appear
to be exactly like a regular ‘son,’ yet she has been regarded as a
‘substitute’ or ‘secondary son,’ on the ground that being a girl, she
has a body wherein the constituents of the <em>father’s</em> body are less than
those of the <em>mother’s</em>; it is for this reason that Yājñavalkya has
called her ‘equal’ to the ‘Body-born’ Son;—the son of the Appointed
Daughter is ‘secondary,’ the constituents of the bodies of his
grandparents existing in his body indirectly (through his mother). In
the case of the ‘Dattaka,’ ‘Krīta,’ ‘Kṛtrima,’ ‘Svayamdatta’ and
‘Apabiddha,’ on the other hand,—where the ‘son’ is not born of either of
the adoptive parents,—there is no connection at all with the
constituents of the bodies of these latter; and in their case, their
character of ‘secondary son’ would rest entirely upon the verbal
authority of the texts, and in their case the term ‘<em>pratinidhi</em>,’
‘substitute,’ would mean ‘<em>anukalpa</em>,’ ‘secondary alternative.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 837), which notes that these sons
are not regular ‘sons,’ the name being applied to them only on the
ground of their performing the functions of the son;—in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 552, 652 and 683);—in <em>Dattakamīmānsā</em> (p.
29);—in <em>Dattakacandrikā</em> (p. 48);—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra
189b), which says that the reason for their being called ‘secondary
substitutes’ lies in the fact that there have been no marriage and other
rites performed.</p>

<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.33-34).—‘Of the thirteen sons mentioned by Manu, the
Body-born and the Appointed Daughter continue the family.—As in default
of clarified butter, oil is admitted by the righteous as a substitute,
so are the eleven sons admitted as substitutes, in default of the

<p><em>Brahmapurāṇa</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 576).—‘While the Body-born son or
the Appointed Daughter is there, the <em>Kṣetraja</em> and other sons,
belonging as they do to different <em>gotras</em>, are only continuers of the
family; and they perform the <em>śrāddha</em> as slaves.’</p>

<p>Some people explain this to mean the denial of the injunction regarding
the other sons, even in the absence of the ‘legitimate’ son; the sense
being that—‘those that have been described as substitutes to be
appointed in the absence of the legitimate son, should not be appointed,
because; being born of the seed of another man, they are the sons of
that man, and of none other; they cannot he the ‘sons’ of the man that
appoints them.’</p>
<p>Thus, the foregoing texts having sanctioned the appointing of such sons,
and the present text forbidding it, there should be <em>option</em>; and this
option shall be restricted to the inheriting of property. So that the
‘maiden-born,’ the ‘one received along with the wife,’ the ‘son of the
remarried woman’ and the ‘secretly born’ son are not entitled to inherit
property; the ‘adopted’ and the rest are entitled to inherit only in the
absence of the ‘legitimate’ son, while the ‘maiden-born’ and the rest
are not to inherit the father’s property even in the absence of die
‘legitimate’ son; they are entitled to food and clothing only, whether
the ‘legitimate’ son is there or not; since it has been declared (in 202
below)—‘It is only fair that the wise man should give to all food and
clothing according to his means; if he does not give it at all, he would
become an outcast.’—(181)</p>

<p>Medhātithi on verses 182-202 is wanting in all Mss. But Kullūka
criticises his view on 187; and Vivādaratnākara (p. 522) quotes him on
194.</p>
<p>“Hence no subsidiary sons (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda), or no <em>Kṣetrjas</em>
(Nārāyaṇa) are necessary in such a case. Kullūka and Rāghavānanda add
that the brother will take the estate and give the funeral offerings on
failure of a wife, daughters and so forth (Yājñavalkya, 2.135).”—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnkara</em> (p. 582);—in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, (p.
389), which explains ‘<em>ekajātānām</em>’ as ‘born of the same father and
mother’;—in <em>Mitākṣarā</em>, (2.132), to the effect that the verse is meant
to prohibit the adopting of any other person as ‘son,’ so long as the
brother’s son can be adopted; it does not mean that the nephew is a
regular ‘son.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 211), which adds the
following notes:—The term ‘<em>putriṇaḥ</em>’ indicates some action taken by
the man who adopts the ‘son’; so that the meaning of the sentence comes
to be this:—Among uterine brothers, if a son is born to even one, the
others, having no sons of their own, should adopt that son as theirs;
nor would this be repugnant to the prohibition that there can be no
adopting of one who is the only son of his parents; as the only ground
for this prohibition lies in the consideration that if the only son
becomes adopted by another person, the line of his own father becomes
extinct; which consideration is not present in the case in question as
the ‘line’ of all uterine brothers is one and the same; then there is
another reason also; what the prohibition interdicts is the <em>giving</em> of
the only son to be adopted, while in the case in question there is no
<em>giving away</em>, the son being regarded as belonging to all the brothers,
only by mutual understanding.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭtī</em> (p. 668);—in <em>Dattakamīmāṃsā</em>
(p. 10) as lending support to the view that, so far as possible, one
should adopt his own brother’s son, and adds that ‘<em>ekajātānām</em>’ makes
it clear that the adopting is to be done by the uterine brother, not by
a brother born of different fathers or different mothers, and that
‘<em>bhrātṛṛṇām</em> (<em>bhrātṝṇām?</em>)’ implies that there can be no mutual
adoption by the brother of the son of the sister;—and in <em>Vīrmitrodaya</em>
(Vyavahāra 108b).</p>

<p>“Kullūka and Rāghavānanda insert, after ‘who leave no son,’ ‘nor widow
and daughters’, and before ‘brothers’, ‘who leaves no parents.’
Nārāyaṇa, who (as also Govindarāja and Nandana) reads ‘<em>eva vā</em>’, ‘or
brothers’, says that the father inherits the estate of an undivided son
leaving no male issue, or the brothers with his permission, and that the
estate of a divided son descends to his wife and other heirs mentioned
in Yājñavalkya II, 135-136.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>The first half of this verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.132) to the
effect that <em>all</em> sons, ‘body-born’ as well as others, are entitled to
inherit the father’s property. The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> quotes verse 184 and
notes that ‘son’ cannot be taken as standing for the <em>body-bom</em> sons
only; because the rights of the body-born born have been declared in
another verse already.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 653);—and in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 552),
which quotes the first half only;—it quotes the second half on p. 592,
where ‘<em>aputrasya</em>’ is explained as ‘without sons, primary as well as
secondary.’</p>
<p>The second half is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.136), as laying down that
the property of a sonless man goes to his Father or Brother;—again as
justifying the conclusion that, if the man leaves a large property, his
wife is to receive enough for her maintenance and the remainder is to go
to his brother;—again, where the view is expressed that all that is
meant is that both the Father and the Brother are entitled to inherit;
and no priority or preference is meant to be implied by the order in
which the two are mentioned;—on this the <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> notes that this
view is supported by the use of the particle ‘<em>vā</em>’;—again, where it is
explained as meaning that brothers inherit only in the absence of the
father.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 650 and 651);—in
<em>Dattakacandrikā</em> (p. 61);—and by Jīmūtavāhana <em>Dāyabhāga</em>, (p. 253 and

<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (17.4-8).—‘The wealth of a man who dies without male issue goes
to his wife; failing her, to his daughter; failing her to his father;
failing him, to his mother; failing her, to his brother; failing him, to
his brother’s sons; failing them, to his kinsmen; failing them, to
<em>Sakulyas</em>; failing them, to fellow-students; failing them to the King,
except in the case of the property being a Brāhmaṇa’s.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.135-136).—‘Wife, daughters, parents, brothers,
brother’s sons, <em>Sagotras</em>, kinsmen, pupils, fellow-students; among
these the succeeding inherits the property of a man dying without male
issue, only in the absence of the preceding one. Such is the law for all
castes.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (Āparārka, pp. 740, 742, 745).—‘The wife being one half of
the man’s body, the man whose wife is alive is himself still alive; and
while one half of his body is alive, how can any one else take his
property? Hence in the case of a man dying without male issue, even
though his father, brothers and <em>Sapiṇḍas</em> may be living, it is his wife
who inherits his property. If the man dies without leaving a male issue
or a wife, or brother or father or mother, his property shall be divided
by his <em>Sapiṇḍas</em> in proportionate shares. If the man leaves no son, his
<em>Śrāddha</em> shall he performed by his wife; and in the absence of the
wife, by his uterine brother;—failing him, other brothers, or brothers’
sons, or <em>Sapiṇḍas</em>, or <em>Sakulyas</em>, or pupils, or Vedic scholars are
entitled to his wealth.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha</em> (Aparārka, p. 741).—‘If a man dies without male issue, his
property goes to his brother; failing him, to his mother and father; or
to his senior (or junior) wife.’</p>
<p><em>Devala</em> (Do.).—‘The property of the son-less man shall go to his
uterine brothers, or to his daughters of the same caste as himself, or
to his father if he he living, or to brothers of the same caste as
himself, or to his mother, or to his wife;—in this same order.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Do.)—‘If among brothers, some one should die, or go away as a
Renunciate, the other brothers shall divide his property among
themselves, except the <em>Strīdhana</em>; they shall support his wives as long
as they continue to be faithful to their husband.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (Do., 742).—‘The wife should obtain the property of one who
dies childless.’</p>
<p><em>Vṛddha-manu</em> (Do.).—‘A widow, without a son, keeping pure the husband’s
bed, and firm in the observance of her duties, shall offer the Hall of
meal to him and take his entire property.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Do., p. 745).—‘If a man dies after partition, without
leaving a male issue, his father should take his property, or his
brother, or mother, or his father’s mother, in due order.’</p>
<p><em>Pāiṭhīnasi</em> (Vivadaratnākara, p. 592).—‘The property of a son-less man
goes to his brother; failing him to his mother and father, or his eldest
wife, or <em>Sagotras</em>, or pupils, or fellow-students.’</p>
<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (Do., p. 596).—‘In the absence of sons, the nearest

<p>According to Kullūka and Rāghvānanda the verse is meant to indicate the
right of the <em>kṣetraja</em> and other secondary sons to inherit the estate
of grand-father and others dying childless.—According to Nandana it
indicates the right of grand-sons and great grand-sons to inherit before
brothers and the rest.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 592);—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p.
744), as describing the ‘nearest sapiṇḍas’; the sense being that that
sapiṇḍa is the ‘nearest’ who makes water-offerings to the same persons
(father, grandfather and great-grandfather); so that the uterine brother
would be the ‘nearest’; the son of the uterine brother would he one step
removed, as his ‘father’ would be different;—still one further removed
would be the brother’s grandson, as his ‘father’ and ‘grandfather’ would
both be different; so on with the others.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 134), to the effect that the
father, the grandfather and the great-grandfather, irrespective of their
wives, are the ‘<em>deities</em>’ (<em>i.e</em>., recipients) of the water and other
offerings;—and again on p. 195;—and in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p.
655);—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 198b);—and by Jīmūtavāhana
(<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, pp. 157 and 253).</p>

<p><em>Mānava-Śrāddhakalpa</em> (III).—(Same as Manu.)</p>
<p><em>Āpastamba</em> (2.14.2-5).—‘On failure of sons, the nearest <em>Sapiṇḍa</em> takes
the property; failing him, the preceptor; failing him the pupil, who may
use it for the teacher’s benefit or enjoy it himself; or the daughter
may take the property; on the failure of all relations, let the King
take the property.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.21).—‘<em>Sapiṇḍas</em>, <em>Sagotras</em>, those connected by descent
from the same <em>Ṛṣi</em>, and the wife shall share the estate of a person
dying without male issue (or an Appointed Daughter).’</p>
<p>Do. (28.41, 42).—‘Śrotriyas shall divide the estate of a childless
Brāhmaṇa;—the King shall take the property of the other castes.’</p>
<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (1.11.9-15).—‘The great-grand-father, the grand-father, the
father, one’s own-self, the uterine brothers, the son by a wife of equal
caste, the grand-son and the great-grand-son,—these they call
<em>Sapiṇḍas</em>; and amongst these, the son and the son’s son (together with
the father) are sharers of an undivided oblation; sharers of divided
oblations, they call <em>Sakulyas</em>. If no other relations are living, the
property of the deceased man descends to his <em>Sapiṇḍas</em>; on the failure
of <em>Sapiṇḍas</em>, the <em>Sakulyas</em> inherit; on the failure of these, the
preceptor who takes the place of the spiritual father, a pupil or an
officiating priest shall take the property; on failure of these, the
King, who shall give that property to persons versed in the three Vedas;
but the King shall never take the property of the Brāhmaṇa.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (17.81-84).—‘The <em>Sapiṇḍas</em> or the subsidiary sons shall
divide the property of him who has no son of the first six kinds; on
failure of them, the preceptor and the pupil shall take the property; on
failure of these two, the King inherits; but the King shall never take
the property of a Brāhmaṇa.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (17.10-14).—‘Failing brother’s sons, the property goes to the
relations called <em>Bandhu</em>; failing these, to those called <em>Sakulya</em>;
failing these, to a fellow-student; failing him, to the King, except
when it is Brāhmaṇa’s property;—the property of the Brāhmaṇas goes to
Brāhmaṇas.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2. 135-130).—‘The wife, daughters, parents, brothers,
brother’s sons, <em>Sagotṛa, Bandhu</em>—relations, pupils,
fellow-students,—from among these in the absence of the preceding, the
succeeding inherits the property of the man who dies without male issue.
This is the law for all castes.’ <em>Nārada</em> (Aparārka,p. 715).—‘Inthe
absence of daughters, the property goes to <em>Sakulyas</em> and <em>Bāndhuvas</em>,
and then to people of the same caste; and failing all these, to the
King. In the absence of all relations, the holy Brāhmaṇas learned in the
Vedas inherit the property; the property of the Brāhmaṇa shall not be
taken by the King; of men of other castes, the property shall be taken
by the King.’</p>
<p><em>Paiṭhīnasi</em> (Aparārka, p. 716).—‘The property of the learned Brāhmaṇa
goes to the Assembly, <em>not to</em> the King.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Sapiṇḍāt</em>’.—“In the text the word is masculine. Kullūka begins by
taking it generally as masculine or feminine, then, after giving the law
of inheritance for the sons, he begins by taking the wife as the first
female inheritor, quotes seven verses of Bṛhaspati and Vṛddha Manu, and
also Yājñvalkya (2.135-136) to prove the statement; and ends by giving a
list of female <em>sapiṇḍas</em>, after denouncing Medhātithi, because he
denies the wife the right of sharing the inheritance”.—Hopkins.</p>
<p>Rāghavānanda agrees, in substance, with Kullūka; but in order to make
the rule still more fully agree with Yājñavalkya (2. 35-136), he asserts
that the cognates (Bandhus) are also implied by the term
‘sakulya’.—According to Nandana, the ‘sakulyas’ are <em>Samānadakas</em>.</p>
<p>The first half of this verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.136), as
lending support to the view that among brothers, the first claim is that
of the uterine one, those born of other mothers being a step further
removed;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 744) to the effect that the <em>nearer sapiṇḍa</em>
has the prior claim,—‘nearness’ having been described under 186.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 592), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Anantaraḥ</em>’, near,—‘<em>dhanam</em>’, of the man without
son,—‘<em>sakulya</em>’ here stands for <em>Samānadaka</em>;—in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p.
63), in support of the view that the claim of the <em>sister</em> comes next to
that of the grandmother (paternal);—in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 195), which
explains the meaning to be that ‘from among the Sapiṇḍas of the dead
man, the <em>nearest</em> will inherit his property’;—in <em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em>
(pp. 10 and 28);—in <em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 40b);—in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 570 and 662);—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, p. 154);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 332), which,
explains ‘<em>sakulya</em>’ as ‘beyond the Sapiṇḍa’, and also as ‘the
descendant of great-great-grandfather’.</p>

<p>According to Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, this verse refers to the case in
which a duly authorised widow bears a son to her husband through a
<em>sagotra</em>; and the former adds that this practice having been already
sanctioned under verse 59, it is mentioned here again with a view to
make it clear that the son may be obtained by the widow, not only “from
the younger brother-in-law or a Sapiṇḍa”, but also from a remoter
<em>sagotra</em>.—Nārāyaṇa holds the meaning of this verse to be that the son
that the widow bears, even <em>without authorisation</em>, to a <em>sagotra</em>,
shall inherit the property of the husband of that widow. He adds that
some people apply this rule to <em>Śūdra</em> females only.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 589), which adds the
following notes:—The widow of a deceased person should bear a son from a
‘<em>sagotra</em>’—<em>i.e. either from the younger brother-in-law or a
sapiṇḍa</em>—should make over the property owned by her dead husband to that
son, and she should not take it herself; such is the opinion of the
<em>Pārijāta</em>;—the author of the <em>Prakāśa</em> on the other hand holds the
meaning to be that the king himself should make the widow bear a son
through a <em>sagotra</em>, and hand over to him the father’s property;—the
final result of both the explanations is the same.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 742), which explains ‘<em>tasmai</em>’ (which is
its reading for ‘<em>tasmin</em>’) as ‘to that child’;—and in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 758).</p>

<p>Kullūka and Nandana take this verse as referring to the case in which a
woman married twice successively two husbands and bore a son to each of
them; in this case, on the death of the husbands, the property of each
should be given by the mother to his own son.—Rāghavānanda, while
accepting this explanation, proposes another:—‘If two sons begotten by
two different men contend for the separate property of their mother,
&amp;c., &amp;c.’.—Nārāyaṇa holds that the verse refers to a contention between
a ‘body-born’ son and a ‘<em>golaka</em>’ or ‘<em>Paunarbhava</em>’ son for the
estates of their respective fathers held by their mother.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 588), which notes that the
term ‘<em>strī</em>’, according to the <em>Pārijāta</em>, stands for the prostitute,
the re-married widow or the dissolute woman;—and in
<em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (pp. 483 and 758).</p>

<p>According to Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, this rule applies to <em>unmarried</em>
daughters only, the married daughters receiving only a fourth of a
brother’s share (see 118 above).—Nārāyaṇa holds that ‘<em>mātrikam
riktham</em>’ refers to property other than the ‘<em>strīdhana</em>’, and qualifies
the ‘sisters’ as ‘without son’.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 667), which adds the
following notes:—The meaning of the verse is that the mother’s estate is
to go (1) to her own daughters, (2) on their absence to her daughter’s
sons, (3) in the absence of these latter to her <em>own</em> sons, not to the
sons of her cowives, (4) in the absence of her sons, to the sons of her
own son;—the expression ‘<em>samam sarve sahodarāḥ</em>’ is meant to preclude
the brothers born of different mothers;—the sons of co-wives being
entitled to inherit only in default of the woman’s own sons (or
grandsons).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.145), as asserting the title of both sons
and daughters to the estate of their mother; it explains the
construction as—‘<em>Mātṛkam riktham sarve sahodarāḥ samam bhajeran
sanābhayo bhaginyaśca samam bhajeran</em>’;—it does not mean that the ‘<em>sons
and daughters</em> together shall divide the property equally’; if this were
the meaning then the words used would have been ‘<em>bhrātṛbhagiyaḥ</em>’ or
‘<em>bhrāṭaraḥ</em>’;—the term <em>samam</em> is meant to preclude the special
additional share’ (of the eldest brother), and ‘<em>sahodarāḥ</em>’ to preclude
the brothers born of other mothers:—The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> reproduces the
remarks noted above from the <em>Madanapārijāta</em>, attributing it to the
<em>Kalpataru</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 721), which remarks that the particle
‘<em>ca</em>’ (‘<em>bhaginyaśca</em>’) denotes <em>option</em>, not <em>combination</em>; and in the
option, the first title is of the <em>unmarried</em> daughters;—in
<em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 515), which adds the following notes—‘<em>Samam</em>’,
without any additional share being allotted to the
eldest,—‘<em>bhaginyaḥ</em>’, those that are unmarried and those that have had
no children,—‘<em>Sanābhayaḥ</em>’, uterine;—in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 70),
which states the opinion of ‘some’ that the verse lays down the conjoint
title of brothers and sisters to such property of their mother as she
had received as presents from her husband;—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, pp. 125 and 142), which explains ‘<em>samam</em>’ as ‘not in unequal
shares’,—<em>Sanābhayaḥ</em>’ as ‘uterine’, and notes that this refers to
<em>unmarried</em> sisters only,—in <em>Nityācārapaddhati</em> (p. 296);—in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 216a), which says that the sense is that all
<em>uterine brothers and sisters</em> are entitled to equal shares in the
mother’s property,—and all half brothers and sisters are excluded;—and
by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 126), which has the same note.</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 368), which
notes that the term ‘six-fold’ is meant to preclude a <em>lesser</em>, not a
<em>larger</em>, number;—in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.135-136), as setting aside the view
that women have no rights to property except through their husband or
son <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> explaining ‘<em>adhyagni</em>’ as that obtained near the fire
at the marriage ceremony,—‘<em>adhyāvāhanikam</em>’ as that obtained at the
time of her coming to her husband’s place;—It is quoted again under
2.143, where it is noted that the <em>six</em> kinds mentioned are meant only
as denying a lesser number; it goes on to quote Kātyāyana as explaining
each of these terms:—‘(1)That which is given to the girl at the time of
marriage near the fire is called <em>adhyagni</em>,—(2) what she receives at
the time of being carried away from her father’s house is called
<em>adhyāvāhanika</em>,—(3) what she receives as a loving present from her
father-in-law or mother-in-law at the time of offering obeisance is
called <em>prītidatta</em>,—(4) (5) (6) whatever the married girl receives from
her husband or from her parents or brothers is called <em>Saudāyika</em>.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 522), which offers the following
explanations:—‘<em>Adhyagni</em>’, what is given by anyone at the time of
marriage,—‘<em>adhyāvāhanika</em>’, whatever is carried behind her when she is
being carried away from her father’s house,—Medhātithi however holds
that <em>adhyāvāhanika</em> is what she receives from her parents-in-law at the
time of returning to her father’s place; and this view also maybe
accepted;—‘<em>prititaḥ dattam</em>’, what she receives from the father-in-law
and other elders as a reward for her character, efficiency and other
good qualities;—the mention of ‘six kinds’ is for the purpose of
precluding a lesser, not a larger, number; in fact a seventh kind,
‘<em>ādhivedanīka</em>’—what she receives by way of compensation for being
superseded by another—has also been mentioned by Yājñavalkya.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 68), which also remarks that the
‘six’ are mentioned only for the purpose of denying a lesser number;—and
in <em>Hemādri</em> (Dāna, p. 51), which explains ‘<em>adhyagni</em>’ as ‘what is
given to the woman before the fire’,—‘<em>adhyāvāhanikam</em>’ as ‘given to her
by her father and relatives at the time of her
marriage,’—‘<em>prītikarmaṇi</em>’, ‘given by the husband as a token of
conjugal love’—and—‘<em>prāptam</em>’ as given to her, even after her marriage,
by her brother and others.’</p>

<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (17.18).—‘What has been given to a woman by her father, mother,
sons, or brothers, what she has received before the sacrificial fire at
the marriage ceremony, what she receives on supersession, what has been
given to her by her relatives, her nuptial fee, and a gift subsequent,
are called <em>strīdhana</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.143).—‘What is given to a woman by her father, mother,
son or brother,—what is given before the nuptial fire, and what comes to
her in connection with her supersession has been called <em>strīdhana</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Aparārka, p. 751).—‘What is given to a woman near the
nuptial fire by gentlemen is called <em>Adhyagni strīdhana</em>. What the woman
obtains at the time of her being taken away from her father’s house is
called the <em>Adhyāvāhanika strīdhana</em>. What is given to her, through
affection, by her father in-law or mother-in-law, at the time of her
bowing to them, is called <em>Lāvaṇyārjita</em>. What is obtained by a married
woman or her husband at her father’s house, either from her parents or
her brother, is called <em>Saudāyika</em>. Over the <em>Saudāyika</em>, the ownership
of the woman is absolute and she is free to sell it or given it away,
even when it consists of immovable property. What the woman obtains,
after marriage, from her husband’s family, or from her husband’s
parents, is called <em>Anvādheya</em> by Bhṛgu. While she is alive, neither her
husband nor her sons nor her brother-in-law nor her husband’s kinsmen,
have any rights over her <em>strīdhana</em>; if they take it from her they
should he punished.’</p>
<p><em>Vṛddha-Vyāsa</em> (Aparārka, p. 752).—‘Whatever the girl obtains, at
marriage or after marriage, from her father’s or brother’s house, is
called <em>Saudāyika</em>. At the marriage of the girl whatever is given with
reference to the bridegroom forms the property of the girl, not to be
divided by her kinsmen.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Do., p. 752).—‘What is given to her, through love, by her
husband, that she shall enjoy as site chooses, even after his death,
with the exception of immovable property.’</p>
<p>Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 524).—‘<em>Adhyagni</em>, <em>Adhyāvāhanika</em>,
<em>Bhartṛdāya</em> (inherited from her husband), what is given by her brother
and what is given by her mother and what is given by her father,—these
are the six kinds of <em>strīdhana</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Śukranīti</em> (4.5.597).—‘The <em>Saudāyika</em> property is known to be that
which comes to a married woman through gifts and dowries, from her
parents’ or husband’s families, or through presents from parents and
relatives.’</p>
<p><em>Pāraskara</em> (Parāśaramādhava, Vyavahāra, p. 372).—‘The <em>strīdhana</em>
belongs to the unmarried daughter; the son cannot have it; if the
daughter has been married, the son shall share it equally with her.’</p>
<p>[(See the texts under
192-193.)]</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 573).—‘Neither the husband, nor the
son, nor the father, nor the brothers have the right to take away or to
spend a woman’s <em>strīdhana</em>; if any one of them takes away the
<em>strīdhana</em> forcibly, he should be made to make it good along with
interest, and should also pay a fine; if any one makes use of it with
her permission, and in a manner agreeable to her, he should repay it, if
he has the wealth to do it. Whatever the woman may have lovingly given
to any of the above relations during his sickness or when he was in
trouble or harassed by creditors,—that also he may voluntarily repay.’</p>

<p><strong>(verses 9.196-197)</strong></p>
<p>‘<em>Vasu</em>’—includes, according to Nārāyaṇa, all kinds of property,
‘<em>strīdhana</em>’ as well as what is not ‘<em>strīdhana</em>’.</p>
<p>These verses are quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 373), which
explains the meaning to be that on the death of a woman married by any
of the forms of marriage here named, without leaving any heir—beginning
from the daughter down to the son’s son,—her property goes to her
<em>husband</em>, and not to her mother or other relations,—while the property
of an heirless woman, who has been married by the Āsura, Rākṣasa or
Paiśāca forms, goes to her parents.</p>
<p>They are quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 753), which remarks that the
devolution of the property on the husband should be regarded as an
optional alternative; it apparently takes ‘<em>āsurādiṣu</em>’ of verse 191 as
including all those mentioned under 196.</p>
<p>They are quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 519), which explains
‘<em>aprajasi</em>’ as ‘childless’; and the verses to mean that (<em>a</em>) in the
case of those married by the forms of marriage mentioned in 196, the
property goes to the husband, and (<em>b</em>) in that of those married by the
forms mentioned in 197, it goes to her father;—it goes on to remark that
this refers to what the woman had received at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>They are quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 72);—in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p.
186), which explains the meaning to be that the ‘<em>strīdhana</em>’ obtained
at the time of the marriage under the forms mentioned in 196 goes to the
husband, while that obtained at the time of marriage under the forms
mentioned in 197 goes first to her mother, and in her absence to her
father;—in <em>Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī</em> (p. 756);—in <em>Dāyākramasaṅgraha</em> (p.
23);—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Culcutta, p. 143), which explains
‘<em>aprajāyām</em>’ as ‘childless’; and by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 141).</p>
<p>Verse 197 is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 219a), which says that
the ‘mother’ being placed first in the compound implies that the father
is to inherit the property only after the mother.</p>

<p><strong>(verses 9.196-197)</strong></p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (17, 19.20).—‘If a woman, married according to one of the first
four forms of marriage beginning with <em>Brāhma</em>, dies without issue, her
<em>strīdhana</em> goes to her husband;—if she has been married by one of the
four reprehensible forms of marriage, her father shall take her
property.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.141-145).—‘If a woman dies without issue, her kinsmen
shall obtain what she had got from her kinsmen, or as her nuptial fee or
as the <em>Anvādheyaka</em> present; if a woman married according to the four
forms of marriage beginning with the Brāhma, dies without issue, her
property goes to her husband; if she had issue, it goes to her
daughters;—if she had been married by the other forms of marriage, her
property goes to her father.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 518).—‘In the absence of the daughter, the
<em>Strīdhana</em> of the mother should go to the sons; what was given to her
by her kinsmen should go to her husband, in the absence of kinsmen. The
sisters along with their husbands shall divide with the kinsmen, the
<em>strīdhana</em>. Such is the lawful law of partition.’</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 667), which makes the
following remarks:—The term ‘<em>strī</em>’ here stands for the <em>step-mother</em>
and ‘<em>kanyā</em>’ for the <em>stepdaughter</em>,—‘<em>Brāhmaṇī</em>’ stands for <em>higher
caste</em> in general, so that the property of a <em>śūdra</em> step-mother will go
to the daughter of her <em>Brāhmaṇī</em> or <em>Kṣatriya</em> or <em>Vaiśya</em> co-wife,
that of the Vaiśya step-mother will go to the daughter of <em>Brāhmaṇī</em> or
<em>Kṣatriya</em> co-wife, and that of the <em>Kṣatriya</em> step-mother to the
daughter of the <em>Brāhmaṇī</em> co-wife,—inasmuch as the present texṭ makes
the property inheritable by the step-daughter of a higher caste, it
follows that step-daughters of the lower caste are not entitled to
inherit the property of the step-mother of a higher caste, so long as
this latter has a son.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 372), to the effect
that, when a woman dies childless, her property goes to the daughter of
that co-wife of hers who is of a higher caste, and in the absence of
such a daughter to the children of that daughter.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 186), which has the following
notes:—In view of the qualification ‘given by the father’, the rule must
be taken as referring to all that she receives from her father at other
times than that of her marriage;—the term ‘<em>Brāhmaṇī Kanyā</em>’ stands for
daughter in general;—or the meaning may be that if a Kṣatriya or Vaiśya
woman dies childless, her property goes to her step-daughter born of her
Brāhmaṇī co-wife, and not to her huśand.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.145) to the effect that on the death of a
childless woman her property goes to her stepdaughter born of a co-wife
of the higher caste, and in the absence of such a daughter, to the child
of that daughter. It adds that the term ‘<em>Brāhmaṇi</em>’ stands for the
<em>higher caste</em>; so that the property of a childless Vaiśya woman goes to
the daughter of her Kṣatriya co-wife. The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds that the
property goes to the <em>step-daughter</em>, not to the <em>step-son</em>; and it goes
on to reproduce the exact words of <em>Madanapārijāta</em> and of
<em>Parāśaramādhva</em>. It remarks that this rule is meant to be an exception
to what has gone before, by which the property of the childless woman
would go to her husband or brother, etc.;—further, that the term
‘<em>kathañcana</em>’ is meant to include property even other than that
received from her father.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 71), which adds that ‘<em>vā</em>’ here
stands for ‘<em>ca</em>’; so that the property is to be divided between the
step-daughter and the step-daughter’s child;—it has been held that the
term ‘<em>Brāhmaṇī</em>’ stands for <em>equal and higheṛ castes</em>; but we find no
authority for this.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 721), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Pitrā</em>’, this is mentioned only by way of
illustration;—‘<em>Kanyā</em>’, step-daughter;—again on p. 753;—and in
<em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em> (p. 26).</p>

<p>“Kullūka and Rāghavānanda take the first clause to refer to the property
of a united family, and the second to the separate property of the
husband.—But according to Nārāyaṇa and Nandana the translation should be
as follows:—‘Wives should never take anything (for their private
expenses) from their husband’s property destined for the support of
their families, over which many have a claim, nor from their own
property which is not <em>strīdhana</em>, without the consent of their
husbands’.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 509), which adds the
following notes:—The term ‘<em>Kuṭumba</em>’ stands for the <em>family-property</em>;
hence the meaning is that ‘out of the property that belongs to many
persons, women shall not make an extraction, withdrawal, without the
consent of the owners of that property’; similarly ‘<em>svakāt</em>’—<em>i.e</em>.,
out of the property that belongs exclusively to her husband, and not to
the other members of the family,—she shall not make an extraction
without the owner’s consent.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 69), which explains ‘<em>nirhāra</em>’
as <em>expenditure</em>;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 215a), which
explains ‘<em>nirhāra</em>’ as ‘<em>vyaya</em>’.</p>

<p>Buhler mispresents <em>Nandana</em>, being misled by the wrong reading
‘<em>bhartṛbhāve</em>’ (while the husband lives) for ‘<em>bhartrabhāve</em>’ (on the
death of the husband). There could be no division of the property by the
heirs while the husband was alive.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 686), which adds that
‘<em>Dhṛtam</em>’ means ‘possessed as her own private property, having been
given to her as a loving present’;—and in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 70),
which explains ‘<em>dhṛtam</em>’ as ‘presented to her by her husband or other
relatives and worn by her.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.147) in support of the view that ‘if a
woman has been living apart from her husband, her property shall not be
taken by her heirs’;—in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 509), which notes that the
<em>Prakāśa</em> has stated that Medhātithi has explained the meaning to be
that ‘the heirs shall not take even those ornaments that may have been
worn by the woman with her husband’s consent, even though not actually
given to her’;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 752), which adds that this refers to
such ornaments as have been worn by the woman constantly;—in
<em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 184), which also reproduces the aforesaid remark of
Medhātithi, that an ornament worn by the woman with her husband’s
consent becomes her property even though not actually given to her;—in
<em>Smṛtisāroddhāra</em> (p. 332), which says that the phrase ‘<em>dhṛto bhavet</em>’
implies that what was not actually worn by her should be divided.</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 385), as enumerating
persons not entitled to inheritance, and hence to the offering of
funeral oblations;—in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 201, and again on
p. 366), where ‘<em>nirindriyāḥ</em>’ is explained as ‘whose organs have become
deficient through some disease’;—in <em>Mitākṣarā</em>, (2.140), which has the
following notes;—‘<em>Nirindriya</em>’ is one whose organs have disappeared by
reason of some disease;—these persons are debarred from inheritance,
being entitled to mere subsistence and clothing; if they are not
supported, his relations become degraded. The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds the
following explanations:—‘<em>Jātyandha-badhirāḥ</em>’ are those who are blind
and deaf by birth,—‘<em>mūka</em>’ is one who is incapable from birth of
uttering words,—thus are these two distinguished from ‘<em>nirindriya</em>,’
which means those who have lost some organ as the result of disease.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em>, (p. 487), which adds the following
notes:—The term ‘<em>jāti</em>’ is added with a view to denote
incurability,—‘<em>jaḍa</em>,’ one who is incapable of distinguishing what is
his own and what belongs to others,—‘<em>nirindriyāḥ</em>’ includes the lame
and the like, who are not entitled to the performance of <em>śrauta</em> and
<em>smārta</em> rites;—and in <em>Dāyakramasaṅgraha</em>, (p. 29).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em>, (p. 73), which explains
‘<em>nirindriyāḥ</em>’ as devoid of the olfactory and other organs;—in
<em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Rājanīti, p. 40), which explains ‘<em>nirindriya</em>’ as one
who has lost his organs through disease;—and in <em>Madanapārijāta</em>, (p.
682), which has the same explanation of ‘<em>nirindriya</em>’ and adds that all
these men have no share in the property, but they have to he supported.</p>

<p><em>Baudhāyana</em> (2.3.37-40)—‘Granting food, clothes and shelter, they shall

<p>Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 489).—Those suffering from chronic or incurable
diseases, the idiot, the insane, the blind and the cripple should be
supported by the family; but their sons are entitled to shares in the

<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Do., p. 750).—‘One born of a wife married irregularly, one
begotten by a <em>Sagotra</em> husband, and one who has gone away as a

<p>‘<em>Longing</em>’—desire to meet, with a view to sexual intercourse. When
there is such longing, the man shall marry. And if there is issue from
the marriage, the ‘<em>child</em>’—whether a son or a daughter —‘<em>is entitled
to inheritance</em>’—to. a share in the property.</p>
<p>The share to which a daughter is entitled has already been explained.</p>
<p>“In the case of the eunuch of the ‘airy’ (infructuous) ‘semen,’ the
desire for sexual intercourse is there; but, how could he have any
‘issue’?”</p>
<p>It has already been declared above (167) that—‘if a son is born to the
wife of a dead man, a eunuch, an invalid, etc.’ (which shows that such
men can have a ‘soil-born’ son, and this is possible only if they have
wives).</p>
<p>Or, the verse may be taken as indicating that in the case of such men,
marriage could only he prompted by lust. If marriage wore prompted
entirely by religious motives, how could there be any marriage for the
men mentioned, being as they are not entitled to the performance of any
religious rites? Then again, the person born blind, the lame, and the
eunuch of the ‘airy semen,’ have been declared to be fit for the
Initiatory Ceremony; the lunatics and others of that kind however are
not fit for that ceremony; how then can there be any marriage in the
ease of those latter?</p>
<p>‘<em>And the rest</em>’—stands for only those already mentioned above (<em>i.e</em>.,
the <em>invalid</em>, etc); but if the phrase ‘<em>and the rest</em>’ were taken as
including <em>all</em>, then the ‘<em>outcast</em>’ also would become included, which,
bring contrary to Law, would be undesirable.</p>
<p>Or, the present rule may be taken as referring to the case where the man
becomes <em>insane</em> or otherwise disabled, after he has been ‘initiated’
and ‘married.’</p>
<p>“But the clause ‘<em>if they happen to have, longing for a wife</em>’—could not
apply to the ease of those who are already married.”</p>
<p>Not so; ‘longing for a wife’ (which has been explained as meaning
<em>desire for sexual intercourse</em>) is quite possible in the case of
married men.</p>
<p>The older writers have found in the present rule something that is
usefully applicable to the case of also such marriages as are contracted
for purely religious purpose?. So that for the eunuch also,—who is
entitled to the performance of such rites as are prescribed by
<em>Smṛtis</em>—it is only right that there be marriage, even in the absence of
sexual desire. As for the rites prescribed in <em>Śrutis</em>, it is only one
who has already got a son that is entitled to the ‘laying of fire’
(which is a necessary accompaniment for those rites); so that the eunuch
can never be entitled to them. And it has been already explained what
really prompts the marriage in such cases.—(203)</p>

<p>‘<em>Kathañcana</em>’.—This indicates that the eunuch and the rest are not
worthy to marry (Kullūka).</p>
<p>‘<em>Apatyam</em>’.—The <em>Kṣetraja</em> son (Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nandana).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 488), which explains
‘<em>tantu</em>’ as <em>child</em>;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 750), to the effect that
marriage is legal for the persons enumerated in 201; it remarks that in
view of the epithet ‘<em>jāti</em>’, ‘born’, in the term ‘<em>jātyandha</em>’, the
present verse cannot be taken as referring to cases where the
disabilities appear after marriage; it comes to the conclusion that the
disability to inheritance cannot thus be due to their not marrying and
hence not being able to perform religious rites; it must be due to the
mere authoritative assertion of the law.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Saṃskāra, p. 195) as indicating that
the marriage of the said persons is sanctioned.</p>

<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.141).—‘Of the eunuch and the rest, the <em>Body-born</em> and

<p>If the eldest brother acquires more properly, either through some
hereditary friend, or from the king or his ministers or his priests, or
out of the farm, by the employment of special methods,—such property
shall be common to all the brothers; and the eldest brother shall not
entertain any such notion as that—‘this property, which was not acquired
by our father, has been acquired by me, through my own efforts, and
hence it is mine only.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Devoted to learning</em>’;—this shows that the rule here laid down
pertains to mechanics, artisans and others who subsist by learning; such
as physicians, dancers, musicians and so forth—(204)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This refers to a united family—as rightly remarked by Kullūka.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 507), which explains the
meaning to be that, if after the death of the father, the eldest brother
should happen to acquire some property by means of exceptional learning
or such other means, in that property the acquirer shall have two
shares, and each of the younger brothers one share, if they are devoted
to study.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.118), which notes the explanation of the
verse as that ‘on the death of the father, or even during the father’s
life-time, if any brother, eldest, youngest or the middle one, happen to
die, his shares are to go to the other brothers, and that, the
implication is that wealth obtained from friends and so forth is
partible’,—and then goes on to criticise it as unwarranted, and
concludes that the verse sets forth an exception to the general rule
that property acquired by each brother separately is impartible.</p>
<p>It is quoted by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 192), which adds that the
younger brothers are as much entitled to inherit the property of the
eldest brother as that of the father,—but with this difference that the
father’s property they inherit even when they are not learned, but to
the brother’s property only those are entitled who are learned.</p>

<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.30 31).—‘What a learned co-parcener has acquired by his
own efforts, he may, at his pleasure, withhold from his unlearned
co-parceners. Unlearned co-parceners shall divide their acquisitions
equally.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.116, 118-119).—‘If one is able to support himself and
does not desire a share in the father’s property, he shall be separated
after having been given some little trifle; the law is that the
division, equal or unequal, should be exactly as the father makes it.—If
among co-parceners some one has, by himself acquired some property,
without detriment to the paternal property,—and if he has obtained
friendly or nuptial gifts,—all such property shall not go to the
co-parceners. If the ancestral property had been taken away by
strangers, and subsequently one of the co-parceners recovers it, he
shall not give it to the other co-parceners; similarly whatever one may
have gained by learning.’</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata</em> (13.105.11.)</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (18.42).—(Same as Manu 208.)</p>
<p><em>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga</em> (Aparārka, p. 724).—If one of the co-parceners recovers the
landed property previously lost, the other co-parceners shall receive
their share of it, after having given the fourth part of it to the
recoverer.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Do.).—‘If some one, living upon food given by a stranger,
has acquired learning, and by means of learning thus acquired, he
acquires some property, that property is what is called the <em>gain of
learning</em>; and such property is not divided; what one obtains from a
pupil, or from officiating at sacrifices, or by answering doubtful
questions, or by putting questions, or by expounding his own knowledge
or by teaching—this also is called the <em>gain of learning</em>; such property
is not to be divided, etc., etc., etc. The learned shall not give to the
unlearned any part of what he has gained by learning, but they shall
give a share to those who are superior, or even equal to them in
learning.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 507).—‘Those who acquired learning in
the family itself, either from their father or from their brothers,—if
such persons acquire property by their learning or by bravery, that
shall be divided—says Bṛhaspati.’</p>
<p><em>Vyāsa</em> (Aparārka, p. 725).—‘What is acquired by learning or by bravery,
or as a present in marriage,—all this shall not be sought after by
co-parceners at the time of partition.’</p>
<p><em>Vyāsa</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 510).—‘What was given to one by the
grandfather or the father as a loving gift, as also what was given by
the mother, should not be taken away from him.’</p>
<p>Do. (Do., p. 502).—‘The property that one has acquired by his own
effort, without drawing upon the paternal property,—as also what he has
gained by his learning,—all this he shall not give to his co-parceners.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Do.).—‘The learned shall not give to the unlearned any part of
his gain of learning, unless he wishes to do so; provided that he had
acquired those gains without employing any part of the paternal property
for that purpose. The brother who supports the family of the brother
while the latter is acquiring learning, should, even though he be
unlearned, obtain some share of the property acquired by that learned
brother. (Then it reproduces Manu 204.)’</p>
<p>Do. (Vivādaratnākara, p. 501).—‘The property acquired by bravery, or
inherited from one’s wife, or that acquired by learning,—these are
declared to be not liable to division; so also what may have been given
by the father as a loving gift, or what the mother may have given
through love, out of her own property.’</p>
<p>Do. (Do., p. 508).—‘In a joint family whatever conveyances or weapons
one member acquires through bravery and such qualities, in that the
brothers also shall have shares ; <em>i.e</em>., the acquirer shall have two
shares and the rest, one share each.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Do., p. 503).—‘There shall be no division of the
dwelling-house, of water-vessels, of ornaments, of such women and
clothes as have been used, and of water-drains,—so says Prajāpati.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (Do., p. 508).—‘Among brothers living in the joint family,
what the learned acquires by learning—the unlearned also shall divide
equally.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (Do.).—‘Those who may have specially worked to acquire the
property shall receive two shares.’</p>
<p><em>Brhaṣpati</em> (25.77-78).—‘If among re-united co-parceners, anyone should
acquire property through learning, valour, or other independent effort
of his own, a double share must be given to him; the rest shall take
equal shares. Whatever has been given to one by the paternal
grandfather, or the father, or the mother, all that shall not be taken
from him; he shall keep likewise the property acquired by valour, and
also the wealth of his wife.’</p>

<p>In this case no intention is to be paid to the larger or smaller amount
of property acquired by them. But even so, if some one of them happens

<p>If the difference in the properties acquired by them is small, the

agriculture (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana), or service of the king

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 507), which explains the

unlearned, if they acquire wealth, this wealth, which is not inherited
from the father, is to be divided equally among them, and there is not
to be any additional share to any one on the ground of any additional

<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 57), which has the following
notes:—‘<em>Īhā</em>,’ agriculture and the rest,—‘<em>apitrye</em>,’ which does not
form part of the ancestral property.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 727);—and in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta,

‘<em>samaḥ</em>’ as ‘not unequal,’ which precludes the special share of 20 per

<p>‘<em>Marriage—presents</em>’—in the shape of dowry and the like.</p>
<p>‘<em>In connection with the honey-mixture</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., in consideration of
priestly functions. Though this also is a ‘gain of learning,’ yet it has
been mentioned separately, because it is obtained by means of the
special kind of work of officiating at sacrifices.</p>
<p>‘<em>Marriage</em>—<em>presents</em>’—stand for all that is received from the

<p>When several brothers are living together, and jointly manage their

does not help in the management,—it is the debarring of such a brother
that is declared here.</p>
<p>‘<em>He shall</em> <em>be debarred</em>’— set aside—‘<em>from his share</em>’ in the nett
profits of the estate. These profits shall not he given to the said
brother; he however is not to be debarred from the main ancestral
estate. But the profits also shall not be wholly taken away from him; a
part of his share of the profits shall be taken by the others, in
exchange for their own labour, and the remainder shall he given to him
‘by <em>way of maintenance</em>.’</p>
<p>Or ‘<em>nirbhājyaḥ</em>’ may mean ‘shall he separated,’ ‘not allowed to live
jointly.’ Because, it is just possible that after some time ho may
acquire more property and become entitled to an equal share (?) In such
a case what the allotment of shares shall be has been indicated by
Nārada, whose declaration shows that the man is to have a larger share
in the property named, and only a small share in what is not. so named.

<p>It has been already declared that a man need not give what he acquires
by his learning; this verse lays down that he need not give what he
himself acquires by agriculture and other means.</p>
<p>“This verse alone would have been enough:^(‘)the man need not give,
unless he wishes it, what he acquires by his own labour’; what was the
need for the other verse making special mention of the ‘gains of
learning’?</p>
<p>The answer to this is that there is no individual^(‘)effort’ or ‘labour’
involved is the case of^(‘)friendly presents,’ ‘marriage presents,’ and
the like; hence it was necessary to have a distinct verse referring to
these.—(208)</p>

<p>‘<em>Anupaghnan</em>’.—‘Without using’ (Nandana);—‘without living upon

brothers exert themselves according to their ability.—Buhler.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.118), which explains ‘<em>Śrameṇa</em>’

totally differently, the meaning of which is ‘that shall not be given to
the co-sharers, norwhat is gained by learning’.—The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds
that ‘<em>anupaghnan</em>’ is to be construed as ‘<em>anupaghnatā</em>.’</p>

<p>If in addition to what he has inherited, the father recovers such
ancestral property as had become lost, he shall not, unless he wishes
it, share it with his sons, even after these latter have attained their
majority.</p>
<p>“But what would he the occasion for partition among sons while the
father is still alive?”</p>
<p>The answer to this is that such an occasion would arise when the father
himself proceeds to make the division among his sons. This is what has
been thus declared (by <em>Gautama</em>, 28.2)—‘When their mother has ceased to
menstruate, and when the father, though living, desires it, the sons
shall divide the property’;—and again ‘When the father has ceased to
have any longings, and when he has ceased to have intercourse with his
wife’ (<em>Nārada</em> 13.3).</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if there were no such restrictions, the son would
become entitled to their grandfather’s property as soon as they were
born; as it has been declared that—‘over the property movable or
immovable, that has been left by the grandfather, both the father and
the son have the same right.’ Having this right, all the sons are
entitled to equal shares in their grandfather’s property; since <em>shares</em>
only follow the <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The father, after the birth of his son, shall not invest his ancestral
property in mortgages or purchases; but using it for the proper
maintenance of his family however has been permitted. In actual
practice, even though, under the circumstances, the sons have a right
over the ancestral property, yet from the deprecatory assertion—‘the
sone (son/one?) who divide the property against their father’s wish are
to be deprecated’—it follows that the sons who force the partition on
their father incur a sin. Such as even though one may acquire property
by receiving constant gifts, yet the act of acquiring such property is
blameworthy. Similarly, even though the property (thus shared with the
unwilling father) is the hereditary property of the sons, yet it is open
to censure. For this reason, so long as they have any other means, the
sons should never ask their father for a partition; as such asking would
be immoral.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, even in the case of the father’s self-acquired
property, he himself divides it among his sons as soon as they have
attained their majority and he finds them duly qualified. It has also
been declared that—‘when the father has reached old age, he shall
himself divide the property among his sons, allotting to the eldest a
preferential share, and equal shares to the rest,’ (<em>Nārada</em>, 13.4).
This, however, does not apply to the property that may have boon left by
the grandfather; because, out of that, the father has no power to allot
any ‘preferential share’—the right of both parties over it being equal.</p>
<p>As for the declaration—‘unequal division has been declared to be legal,
when made by the father’ (<em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 2.116),—this has been taken to
apply to a certain extent to the grandfather’s property also. In a case
where there are no two full shares, there would be an exception, in the
case of self-acquired property. (?)—(209)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>This verse has been taken by Nārāyaṇa to imply that ancestral property
may be divided by the sons even during the life-time of the father, even
though the latter may be unwilling.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.121), which explains the meaning
as follows:—“If a property was acquired by the grandfather, but taken
away by some one else and not redeemed during his life-time, when such
property has been redeemed by the father (the grandfather’s son), this
is as good as ‘self-acquired’ by the father, and hence the father may
not divide this with his sons, unless he is himself willing to do so”;
and it takes this to imply that in the case of other kinds of ancestral
property the sons may force partition on the father.—The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em>
adds that ‘<em>svārjitam</em>’ being explained as ‘as good as self-acquired’,
the explanation of it given by ‘Medhātithi—as ‘acquired by his own
learning &amp;c.’—becomes unacceptable.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 461), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Paitṛkam</em>’, ancestral—‘<em>anavāpyam</em>’ (which is its reading for
‘<em>anavāptam</em>’), which is hard to be recovered by the father; such
property being ‘self-acquired’ by the father, he shall not divide it
with his sons, except when he is quite willing.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 339), which has the
same explanation as <em>Mitākṣarā</em>;—in <em>Dāyatattva</em> (p. 9);—in
<em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra 35a);—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p.
126), to the effect that in regard to the property acquired by the
father, independently of his ancestral property, sons have no voice, he
himself being the sole disposer of it;—in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra
177b), which explains ‘<em>svayamārjitam</em>’, (1) as ‘<em>svayamarjitamiva</em>’,
‘it is <em>as if it were</em> his self-acquired property’; and (2) as giving
the reason for the law laid down, ‘<em>since</em>,’ ‘it is his self-acquired
property’;—and says that ‘<em>akāmaḥ</em>’ implies that <em>if the father so
wishes</em>, he may divide the property among his sons;—and by Jīmūtavāhana
(<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p. 201).</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (18.43).—‘If a man recovers a property which could not before be
recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free will,
divide it with his sons; as it is an acquisition made by himself.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.119).—‘If one recovers an ancestral property that had
been taken away by others, he shall not give it to his co-parceners; nor
what he has acquired by his learning.’</p>
<p><em>Ṛṣyaśṛṅga</em> (Aparārka, p. 724).—‘If one of the co-parceners recovers

<p>The meaning of the verse is quite clear. It is meant to forbid the
‘preferential share’ which would appear to be the standing rule in
connection with all partition; specially in view of what has been said
above (205) regarding ‘the property being not acquired by the
father’(205). It is only out of all kinds of property <em>acquired by the
father</em> that there is to be a ‘preferential share.’ In the present case,
however, the property might in a sense be regarded as ‘acquired by the
father,’ and hence, the possibility of the ‘preferential share,’—which,
therefore, has had to be expressly denied.—(210)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.139);—in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p.
678), to the effect that in the case noted there is no unequal
division;—in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 748), which adds that this prohibits only
that unequal division, which is in the form of additional shares for the
eldest brother,—and not other kinds of unequal division; so that each
brother obtains, on partition, that part of the property which was his
when they entered into joint life.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 601), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Saha jīvantaḥ</em>’, living after joining together,—‘<em>samastatra
vibhāgaḥ</em>’, <em>i.e</em>., there is to be no additional share for the eldest,
and so forth.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 65), which mentions two
opinions—one, is that which has been set forth in <em>Aparārka</em>, and
another that there is to be absolutely equal division all round;—in
<em>Nṛsiṃhaprasāda</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 41b);—by Jīmūtavāhana (<em>Dāyabhāga</em>, p.
342), which says that the equal partition is meant for brothers of the
same caste as the father;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 210a), which
explains the implication of the last clause to be that there is no
unequal division <em>due to seniority</em>, but there is unequal division on
other grounds.</p>

partition’ (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>‘<em>Bhāgo na lupyate</em>.’—‘His share must not be divided by his co-parceners

in the next verse’ (Medhātithi, Rāghavānanda).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2. 139), which explains the meaning
as follows:—‘among united brothers, if, at the time of partition,
one—either the eldest or the middle or the youngest—should happen to be
disqualified from receiving his share—either by entering another stage
of life or by committing such heinous sins as the killing of a Brāhmaṇa,

<p>It is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 678), which adds the same
explanation as <em>Mitākṣarā</em>; but as grounds of disqualification, it
mentions ‘entering of another life-stage or becoming an outcast’; it
adds that the next verse lays down what is to be done with the share
thus set aside.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 749), which explains ‘<em>amṣhapradāna</em>’ as
<em>partition</em>; and points out that ‘<em>hīyate</em>’ means disqualification by
reason of ‘renunciation’, ‘becoming an outcast’ and so forth; his share
however is not lost, does not disappear,—it has to be determined and
disposed of as laid down in the next verse.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 601), which explains as
follows:—‘Hence among united brothers, if anyone should take to
renunciation, or by some such cause become deprived of his share, or
should happen to die, his share does not disappear’;—and in <em>Dāyatattva</em>
(p. 55).</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 67), which explains ‘<em>hīyate</em>’ as
‘by reason of entering another state or becoming an outcast—and in

explanation:—‘Among united brothers, who are sons of different mothers,
if any one,—either the eldest or the middle or the youngest—should be

<p>The property shall be taken by those ‘<em>uterine brothers</em>’ who may have
been ‘<em>united</em>’ with him in property;—also ‘<em>consanguineous</em>
<em>sisters</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., those that are unmarried; it is only these that are
called ‘<em>consanguineous, sanābhi</em>’ (which is the term used in the text);
those that are married go over to the ‘family’ of their husbands, and
hence no longer remain ‘consanguineous’ to their brothers.</p>
<p>‘<em>And those brothers that are united</em>’.—The particle ‘<em>ca</em>,’ ‘and,’
includes the ‘sisters’ also.</p>
<p>This should not he taken to mean that the property shall be taken ‘by
the uterine brothers, and also <em>by such brothers as may be united</em>.’ As
in that case those others also who are <em>not uterine</em>, but <em>united</em>,
would be entitled to a share in the property. Among the <em>uterine</em>
brothers, there may he some that are <em>united</em> and others that are <em>not
united</em>; and where there are <em>uterine</em> brothers, united and not united,
it is these that would divide the property among themselves.</p>
<p>Nor would this militate against the following text—‘A brother born of
another mother, even though united, shall not take the property of his
half-brother; while a uterine brother, even though not united, shall
take it, but not the brother born of a different mother.’
(<em>Yājñavalkya</em>, 2.139). The meaning of this is as follows:—‘Even though
united, the half-brother does not receive the property, if a uterine
brother is there, even though not united; while among the uterine
brothers, he alone shall receive it who is <em>united</em>, and not any other,
notwithstanding his uterine character.’ This is what has been declared
in the text—‘Of one who is united with another brother, this united
brother shall receive the property; and the uterine brother that of
another uterine brother.’ (<em>Yajñāvalkya</em>, 2.138). When, however, there
are no <em>uterine</em> brothers at all, then the property shall be taken by
such half-brothers as may be united, and none others. Among uterine
brothers, even when separated, there is always some sort of ‘proximity,’
due to their living near one another; so that the function of the
<em>uterine</em> brother would, in a general way, be accomplished by even those
that may have separated. Hence it is that, among such uterine brothers
also as may have separated, if one dies, his property shall go to the
other uterine brother, whose share in the property can never totally
disappear.</p>
<p>It would not be right to argue against this that—“at the time in
question the share of the separated brother can never come up at all,
and hence there is nothing that would disappear or not disappear.” Since
it has been declared that ‘the son becomes the owner of the property as
soon as he is born’ (so that the ownership of all brothers over the
ancestral property is innate in them);—but so long as the parents are
alive, they have no mastery over it’ (9.104); which shows that all the
sons acquire ownership immediately after the father’s death.—(212)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>
<p>The share of a deceased or disqualified united brother goes first to the
reunited brothers of the full blood and to such sisters of the full
blood as are not married, next to such brothers of the full blood as had
not been reunited, and finally to the reunited half-brothers (Medhātithi
and Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—first to the reunited full brothers,
secondly to the reunited half brothers, then to the full sisters
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).</p>
<p>The said persons inherit the property only on the failure of sons,
wives, daughters and parents (Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>According to Nārāyaṇa what is here said refers to the property of one
who dies before partition; but according to others to that of a reunited
brother only.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.139), which adds the following
explanation:—‘This verse lays down the manner of disposing of the share
set aside in accordance with the preceding verse; which is as
follows:—The uterine brothers shall divide it; <em>i.e</em>., it shall be
divided equally among all his uterine brothers, those that were united
with him as well as those not so united and those who may have gone to
foreign lands; they should all come together and divide the said
property equally among themselves;—also those step-brothers who had been
united with him, and his uterine sisters; all these should divide it
equally among themselves.—The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> has the following
notes:—That the <em>un-united</em> full brothers are meant by the first half is
shown by the mention of the ‘united’ in the second half;—that the second
half refers to <em>half</em> brothers is shown by the mention of ‘<em>uterine</em>’
brothers in the first half;—the half-brothers meant here must be
understood to be of the same caste as the original owner.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 679), which has the following
notes:—The mention of ‘uterine’ in the first half and of ‘brothers,’ in
the second half indicate that the latter stands for <em>half-brothers</em>;—the
mention of ‘united’ in the second half, and the omission of it in
connection with the ‘uterine brothers’ indicate that the uterine
brothers meant are those that were <em>un-united</em>. Thus then the meaning of
this verse comes to be this:—The property that has been set aside as the
share of the disqualified person, shall be divided equally by his
un-united uterine brothers, who should all—even those who may have gone
to other lands—come together for the division; as also the step-brothers
of the same caste as the original owner, who were united with him, and
also his uterine sisters. All these, beginning from the un-united
uterine brothers and ending with the uterine sisters, should divide the
property equally among themselves. That the half-brothers meant here are
those of the same caste as the owner is shown by the fact that for the
brothers of <em>different</em> castes, different shares have been laid down.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 749), which adds the following
explanation—The said share should be taken by those uterine brothers who
were united with the original owner, and not those who were not united,
even though they be his uterine brothers; if there be no <em>united</em>
uterine brothers, then it shall be divided among all his uterine
brothers equally—without any inequality due to seniority and so
forth;—if there be no uterine brothers, then it shall go to the uterine
sisters;—and if there be no uterine sisters, then it shall go to the
step-sisters and step-brothers.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 601), which adds the following
notes—‘<em>Sodary</em> <em>āḥ</em>’ qualifies ‘<em>bhrātaraḥ</em>’ (of the second line); so
that the meaning is that among his ‘brothers’ only those will divide the
said property who fulfill the conditions of being both ‘uterine’ and
‘united and also the uterine sisters who are <em>unmarried</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 362), which explains
the meaning to be that the said property shall be taken by the
<em>un-united</em> uterine brothers, and the <em>united</em> half-brothers, and the
uterine sisters,—all coming together, even those who may have gone to
other lands; it being divided among these equally;—and in
<em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 158), as countenancing the view that
brothers, even though uterine, have no share, if they did not live
jointly.</p>

<p>‘<em>Defrauding</em>’ consists in cheating them out of their share in the
property, as also that of the honours etc., that may be conferred by the
king.</p>
<p>‘<em>Loses his seniority</em>’;—<em>i.e</em>., is to be treated as an ordinary kinsmen
(as laid down in 110). This does not preclude all that is due to him as
the eldest brother.</p>
<p>He loses also his ‘<em>share</em>’—<em>i.e</em>., the ‘preferential share’ due to him
as the eldest brother.</p>
<p>‘<em>Punished</em>.’—As the special form of punishment to be inflicted has not
been specified, he shall be reprimanded or censured or fined, in
accordance with the exact nature of his offence.—(213)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣāra</em> (2. 126) as having been understood
by some people to mean that ‘misappropriation’ of the entire property is
wrong only for the eldest brother, and not for the younger brothers.
This view, it says, is wrong; the verse clearly implying that, just as
it is wrong for the eldest brother who is in the place of father for the
younger brother to misappropriate the property, so it is also for the
younger brothers, who are as ‘sons’ to the eldest brother.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 383), which takes it to
mean that when even the eldest brother, who is independent, is held to
commit a wrong if he does the mis-appropriation, it is all the more
culpable in the case of the younger brothers, who are not independent.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 478), which explains
‘<em>vinikurvīta</em>’ as ‘should defraud,’ and ‘<em>ajyeṣṭhaḥ</em>’ as ‘not to be
respected as the eldest brother’;—and in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 58),
which remarks that the term ‘<em>jyeṣṭhaḥ</em>’ stands for all the heirs to a
property, the meaning being that when the eldest also is held culpable,
how much more so the younger brothers?</p>

<p>‘<em>Addicted to evil deeds</em>’— doing such acts as are forbidden.</p>
<p>When all the brothers are working for the benefit of the whole family,
if the eldest brother surreptitiously takes possession of and invests
the property, under the impression that he would show them the
‘principal’ if they ask for it,—then he should he made to hand over to
all the brothers, the principal along with the interest that may have
accrued to it. But if at the very outset, he lays the whole property
before his brothers and says openly—‘Here is the property, each of you
take your share, I shall separate mine and earn interest on it,’—then
they are not entitled to the interest thus earnad; which belongs
exclusively to the eldest brother, and forms his ‘special hoard.’—(214)</p>

<p>“Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana all three hold that the mother inherits
only on failure of sons (grandsons and great-grandsons, adds Nandana),
widows and daughters; but they disagree with respect to the sequence of
the next following heirs: Kullūka holds that the mother and the father,
whose right has been mentioned above, verse 85, follow next, inheriting
conjointly, then brothers, afterwards brothers’ sons, and after them the
paternal grandmother;—Nārāyaṇa gives the following order: 1. Mother, 2.
Father, 3. Brothers, 4. Brothers’ sons, 5. Maternal
grandmother.”—Buhler.</p>
<p>Hopkins is wrong in saying that verse 185 is not in Medhātithi’s text.
As a matter of fact, Medhātithi’s gloss on that verse has shared the
same fate as that on all the other important verses bearing upon
inheritance.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.135-136) as laying down the
rights of the mother and grandmother to the son’s property. The
<em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> explains ‘<em>vṛttāyām</em>’, as ‘dying’.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 744);—in <em>Vivadaratnākara</em> (p. 591) which

sons and: wife and others’;—the grandmother inherits only in the absence
of brother or other <em>Sapiṇḍas</em>;—the father inherits in the absence of
the mother;—‘<em>dāyādyam</em>’ means ‘property inheritable by heirs’.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vyavahāramayūkha</em> (p. 63) to the effect that in the
absence of ‘brothers’ sons the first claim is that of the
grandmother;—and in <em>Smṛtitattva</em> II (p. 195) to the effect that in the
absence of ‘brothers’ sons’, the property goes to the grandfather, and
in hie absence, to the grandmother; the rights of the grandfather being
superior to those of the grandmother, just as those of the father are
superior to those of the mother.</p>

<p>The singular number in ‘cloth,’ ‘conveyance‘ornament,’ and ‘cooked food’
is meant to be significant.</p>
<p>‘<em>Conveyance</em>’—vehicle; such as a chariot, a cart and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Ornament</em>’—the ring and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Cloth</em>’—of ordinary quality, not what is exceptionally valuable.</p>
<p>‘<em>Water</em>’—well, tank and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Women</em>’—female slaves.</p>
<p>‘<em>Yogakṣeman</em>’—what is conducive (‘<em>kṣema</em>’) to welfare (‘<em>yoga</em>’);
<em>e.g</em>., experienced ministers, priests, councillors and so forth. These
are helpful in guarding the household against thieves and others.</p>
<p>In another <em>Smṛti</em> it is found that ‘there is no division of the
dwelling-house.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Pasture-ground</em>’—where the cattle graze.</p>
<p>From what is declared here it would follow that it is not absolutely
true that there is nothing wrong in dividing what has been left by the
father. But this denial is of that kind of which a transgression
involves no sin. (?)—(219)</p>

<p>‘<em>Striyaḥ</em>’—‘Female slaves’ (Medhātithi);—‘wives’ (Nārāyaṇa).</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) ‘<em>Yogakṣemam</em> (<em>b</em>) <em>pracāram</em>’.—(<em>a</em>) ‘agencies securing
protection; such as councillors, parents, old ministers, who protect
people against thieves; (<em>b</em>) pasture land’ (Medhātithi, who is badly
misrepresented by Buhler; Kullūka and Raghāvānanda);—(<em>a</em>) ‘means of
gain, <em>e.g</em>., a royal grant, and means of protection (<em>b</em>) and roads’
(Nārāyaṇa);—(<em>a</em>) sources of gain, persons for whom one sacrifices, and
means of protection, (<em>b</em>) path leading to fields.’ (Nandana).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Madanapārijāta</em> (p. 685), which adds the
following notes—Only those clothes are impartible which are worn
;—‘<em>patram</em>,’ conveyances, <em>e.g</em>., horses, palanquins and so forth; of
these also those are not to be divided which have been in the constant
use of any one exclusively;—or ‘<em>patra</em>’ may be taken as ‘property
consisting of a written document’;—in <em>Dāyakrama-saṅgraha</em> (p. 37);—and
in <em>Vīra</em> <em>mitvodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 221a), which explains ‘<em>patram</em>’ as
<em>conveyance</em>.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.118) as describing property that cannot
be partitioned;—it goes on to add that of clothes those only are
impartible which have been worn by some one; the clothes that were worn
by the father should, on bis death, be given away to persons fed at his
<em>Śrāddha</em>. The <em>Bālambhaṭṭī</em> adds that the view of Medhātithi and
<em>Kalpataru</em>—that valuable clothes are not included here—is to be
rejected</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 725), which adds that the explanation by
some people of ‘<em>patram</em>’ as <em>conveyance</em> is opposed to the text of
Kātyāyana, by which the word stands for ‘property entered in a written
document.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 504), which adds the following
notes:—‘<em>Patram</em>’ is ‘property entered in a written document,’ as is
clear from the texts of Kātyāyana; though <em>Halāyudha</em> has explained it
to mean ‘conveyance’;—‘<em>Kṛtānnam</em>,’ flour and rice, says the
<em>Pārijāta</em>;—‘<em>Striyāḥ</em>,’ those that are ‘<em>Samyukta</em>,’ ‘attached to,’ any
one in particular;—‘<em>Yogakṣemam</em>’ stands for ministers and priests who
are the agents of protection;—‘<em>Pracārāḥ</em>,’ paths for the passing of
cattle;—<em>Halāyudha</em> has explained ‘<em>Yoga</em>’ as ‘boats and such things’
and ‘<em>Kṣema</em>’ as ‘forts and such means of safety.’</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em> (Vyavahāra, p. 380), which has the
following notes—‘Clothes’ that are worn;—the clothes worn by the father
should, on his death, be given away to the persons fed at his <em>Śrāddha</em>.</p>

<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (18.44).—‘Apparel, vehicles, and ornaments, prepared food,
water, females, property set apart for pious purposes or for sacrifices,
a common pasture-ground and document (or books) are impartible.’</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (28.46-47).—‘Water, property set apart for pious uses or for
sacrifices, and prepared food shall not be divided;—nor women already
connected.’</p>
<p><em>Śaṅkha-Likhita</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 503).—‘There shall he no division
of the dwelling house, or of water-vessels, ornaments, employed women,
clothes, or water-drains,—so says Prajāpati.’</p>
<p><em>Vyāsa</em> (Do., pp. 504-505).—‘Persons for whom one officiates at
sacrifices, agricultural holdings, conveyance, prepared food, water, and
woman are impartible.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Do., pp. 504-505).—‘Property that has been set apart by
means of a document for religious purposes, water, wives, hereditary
mortgage (<em>nibandha</em>?), clothes and ornaments that have been worn,
articles whose division is impossible, pasture-ground, paths,—these
should not be divided.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (25.79-85).—‘Those by whom clothes and the like articles
have been declared to he impartible have not taken into consideration
the fact that the wealth of the rich is based upon clothes and
ornaments;—such wealth, when withheld from partition, will yield no
profit; but it cannot be allotted to a single co-parcener. Therefore it
has to be divided with some skill, or else it would be useless.—Clothes
and ornaments are to be divided after selling them (and distributing the
proceeds); a written bond is divided after recovering the amount
involved; prepared food is divided by means of exchange with unprepared
food.—The water of a well or a pool shall be drawn and used according to
need. A single female slave shall be successively made to work at the
houses of the several co-sharers, according to their respective
shares.—If there are many such slaves, they shall be divided equally.
The same rule applies to male slaves also. Property obtained for a pious
purpose shall he divided in equal shares.—Fields and embankments shall
he divided according to the several shares. A common road or
pasture-ground shall be always used by the co-sharers in due proportion
to their several shares.—The clothes, ornaments, bed and the like, as
well as conveyances and such things—appertaining to the father—shall he
given to the person who pertakes of his funeral repast, after honouring
him with fragrant drugs and flowers.’</p>

the betting, as also on those who as keepers of gaming houses, abet
others to do it;—‘<em>dvijaliṅginaḥ</em>’ are men who wear the marks of the

<p>Those officers who have been ‘<em>deputed</em>’—appointed—‘<em>to look after the
business</em>’— investigation of eases and so forth—‘<em>of suitors</em>’,—as
representatives of the King;—if these, ‘<em>fired by the heat of
wealth</em>’—<em>i.e</em>. having received bribes from either party—‘<em>hamper that
business</em>’,—‘<em>these the king shall render penniless</em>’,—<em>i.e</em>. he shall
confiscate all their property.</p>
<p>Though for the delinquency of officers a distinct punishment is going to
be prescribed (in 234), yet what is here laid down refers to the case of
repeated offences.</p>
<p>Other officers also—such as the commander of an army and the like—when
ordered against a certain party, take bribes from him, and do not
proceed to capture him;—these also shall be met with the same
punishment.</p>
<p>Others read ‘<em>aniyukta</em>’ (for ‘niyukta’); and in that case the meaning
is—‘If some persons though not appointed to any office, proceed to help
one or the other party,—either on account of their considering
themselves the king’s favourites, or of their being very rich,—and thus
prevent justice bring done to the other party,—they shall be punished as
here prescribed.’</p>
<p>In this case, the epithet ‘<em>fired by the heat of wealth</em>’ (<em>i</em>. <em>e</em>.,
bribed) would not have any significance; <em>not</em> ‘<em>appointed</em>’ being the
most significant qualification in this case.—(231)</p>

<p>Whenever a transaction in the King’s Court has been ‘<em>finally
settled</em>’,—the root ‘<em>tīr</em>’ (in ‘<em>tirtam</em>’) denoting
<em>completion</em>,—<em>i.e</em>. definitely concluded,—not only verbally, but duly
recorded;—as also ‘when a punishment has been inflicted’;—all this the
king shall ‘<em>accept as lawfully done, and shall not annul it</em>’;—except
in the case of the doubling of a fine,—which is thus recommended—‘the
king shall revise the case with a view to inflicting a double
fine’.—(233)</p>

<p>“Medhātithi and Kullūka refer this prohibition to cases which have been
properly decided in the King’s Courts, while Nārāyaṇa thinks that it
applies to orders passed by former kings.—Nandana gives a different
explanation of the words ‘<em>tīritam</em>’ and ‘<em>anuśiṣṭam</em>’&hellip;&hellip; according
to which the former means ‘a cause or plaint declared to be just or
unjust by the assessors,’ and the latter ‘a cause or plaint confirmed by
witnesses’.”—(Buhler).</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Smṛtitattva</em>, (II, p. 231), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Anuśiṣṭam</em>,’ confirmed by witnesses and other
evidence, and hence ‘<em>tīritam</em>,’ decided by the assessors;—such suit the
king shall not reopen.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2.306), which explains the meaning to be
that the king shall not have a suit reopened simply with a view to exact
a heavier fine; he may however have a decided suit reopened when the
losing party applies for reconsideration and stipulates that he would be
prepared to pay a double fine in the event of the suit being again
decided against him.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Parāśaramādhava</em>, (Vyavahāra, p. 161), which adds that
the verse refers to cases where the finding of the Court has been
accepted by the parties concerned;—in <em>Kṛtyakalpataru</em> (64b), which has
the following notes—‘<em>Tīritam</em>,’ decided and finished,—‘<em>anuśiṣṭam</em>,’
deposed to by the witnesses ,—‘<em>yatra kvacana</em>,’ in the village-assembly
or other places;—and in <em>Vīramitrodaya</em> (Vyavahāra 38b), which says

<p>Do. (2.304).—‘Those cases that have been wrongly decided, the King shall
try again and punish each of the judges and the party in whose favour
the case had been decided by them, with a fine double the amount of the

<p><em>Nārada</em> (Aparārka, p. 866).—‘When a legal transaction has been
completed and a punishment has been inflicted,—if a party feels that it
has been illegally done, he should have the case re-tried, undertaking
to pay double the fine previously inflicted upon him.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (6.5).—‘When a party does not feel satisfied with the

<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (5.1-8).—‘Great criminals should all he put to death;—in the
case of a Brāhmaṇa, no corporal punishment should he inflicted.—A
Brāhmaṇa should he banished from his own country, his body having been
branded.—For murdering another Brāhmaṇa, let a headless corpse be
impressed on his forehead;—for drinking wine, the flag of a
liquor-seller;—for stealing gold, a dog’s foot;—for incest, the mark of
the female part.—If he has committed any other heinous crime, he shall
he banished unhurt, with all his property.’</p>
<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 634).—‘Even though he may have
committed a heinous offence, the Brāhmaṇa should not he killed; he
should he branded and banished with his head shaven.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Do., 635).—‘In the case of the Brāhmaṇa committing any of the
four capital offences, his head shall be shaved and he shall he
banished; and with a view to proclaiming his crime, he shall be paraded
riding on a donkey; or he may be branded on the forehead.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Do.).—‘In the case of the Brāhmaṇa committing any of the four
capital offences,—violating the Guru’s bed, drinking wine, stealing
gold, and killing a Brāhmaṇa,—for violating the Guru’s bed, he should he
branded with the mark of the female part,—for drinking wine, with the
flag of the wine-seller,—for stealing gold, with the mark of the dog’s
foot,—for killing a Brāhmaṇa, the mark of a headless trunk shall be
branded on his forehead; and no one should hold any converse with
him;—such is the teaching of Manu.’</p>

<p>Even though the Brāhmaṇa alone becomes a heinous criminal by drinking
wine, yet even for him there is to be corporal punishment,—though no
corporal punishment has been laid down for the Brāhmaṇa before this.
This follows from the force laid upon the term ‘<em>four</em>’ in this verse.</p>
<p>Others, however, have explained this ‘<em>corporal punishment</em>’ as standing
for <em>branding</em>; and this would be done in the ease of the Brāhmaṇa also.</p>
<p>Others again explain the particle ‘<em>api</em>’ as ‘<em>even</em>,’ and declare that
the penalty here laid down is meant for all the <em>five</em> kinds of ‘heinous
criminals;’ the construction being that—‘this punishment is to be
inflicted on <em>even</em> all these four, as also on the <em>fifth</em>, in the shape
of the person associating with these four.’</p>
<p>For the crime of ‘<em>Brāhmaṇa-slaying</em>,’ ‘corporal punishment’ has been
already laid down above,—in the rule that—‘the king shall put to death
those who kill a woman, an infant or a Brāhmaṇa.’</p>
<p>From what follows in the next verse it is clear that ‘corporal
punishment’ here stands for <em>branding</em>.</p>
<p>‘<em>According to the late</em>’—‘he shall make due discrimination regarding
the greater, or less seriousness of the crime.’—(236)</p>

been prescribed as the penalty.</p>
<p>In the case of the <em>Śūdra</em>, if the crime has been committed
intentionally, there is to be ‘branding’ and ‘confiscation of the whole

death.—(242)</p>

<p>The sin incurred by the king in punishing the innocent is equal to that
incurred in acquitting the guilty,—in connection with the
above-mentioned crimes.</p>
<p>The king receives taxes for fulfilling certain duties; if he fails to do
these, he incurs sin; but the due fulfilment of these does not
necessarily involve spiritual merit As for the declaration —‘<em>merit
accrues to him, if he chastises justly</em>’,—which speaks of merit
accruing—all this is merely commendatory of the injunction regarding the
fulfilment of one’s duties.</p>
<p>The teaching regarding ‘punishments’ is for the purpose of preventing
crime; hence they shall be inflicted, according to law, by various
methods of corporal punishment The declarations made in this connection
pertain to the accomplishment of all such kingly duties as are conducive
to temporal ends; <em>e.g</em>. the punishing of the ‘haughty’, the ‘warlike’
and so forth. And as the teaching pertains to visible ends, it is not
the actual <em>death-penalty</em> that shall be inflicted in all cases. Hence
if the intended chastisement is secured by other means, there would be
nothing wrong in this.—(249)</p>

<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 649).—‘The King who punishes those
who deserve to he punished and protects those who are well-behaved,
performs sacrifices where hundreds of thousands are given as the
sacrificial fee. Punishment unjustly inflicted destroys both spiritual
merit and fame; and when justly inflicted, it brings to the King heaven,
fame and victory.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Do., p. 650).—‘King’s ministers incur terrible sin if they
omit to chastise the sinners and punish those who are well-behaved.’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (Do.).—‘If punishment is wrongly inflicted, the King should
fast for one day, the priest for three days; or, if punishment is not
inflicted on those who deserve it, the King shall fast for three days
and the priest should perform the <em>Kṛcchra</em> penance.’</p>

</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>
<p>What has been indicated in the foregoing verse is now explained.</p>
<p>‘<em>The well-behaved</em>’—those whose behaviour is right,—<em>i.e</em>., consists in
doing what is sanctioned by the Scriptures and avoiding what is
forbidden by them. The compound belongs to the
‘<em>madhyamapadalopi</em>’—ellyptical—class. Thus are included all Vedic
Scholars and the poor and destitute, who pay no taxes. So that by
extending his protection over these men, it is only right that the king
should go to heaven. In the case of other people, since the right of
protection is purchased by the payment of taxes, the king incurs sin by
neglecting it; as is going to be declared in the next verse ‘he falls
off from heaven’. By repaying with protection what he receives in the
form of taxes, the king is only saved from sin, and he does not obtain
heaven.</p>
<p>Or the declaration regarding heaven may be based upon the due fulfilment
of his duties, as already mentioned above.</p>
<p>Others have held the following opinion:—The declaration regarding the
king going to heaven is purely declamatory. In fact the protecting of
those who pay no taxes is also included in the king’s ‘functions’, since
those people also form part of his ‘<em>kingdom</em>’, the protecting whereof
forms the chief function of the king.</p>
<p>[So that for doing this also there can be no reward in the shape of
Heaven]. Just as artisans, who ply their trade for a living, work for
the king for one day during the month;—when they are made by the king to
do his work,in lieu of his taxes; in the same manner the king also, who
carries on his work for a living and engages himself in protecting the
people, is made by the Scriptures to protect the well-behaved people, as
an obligatory duty. Again the man who has laid the fires, prompted by
the declaration of rewards, engages himself in obligatory rites, but not
with a view to obtaining Heaven or any such rewards,—for the simple
reason that such rites have not been prescribed as bringing about
rewards; and yet they are duly performed. Exactly similar would be the
case with the King’s action in protecting his whole Kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus all the declarations of rewards that there are, are to be regarded
as purely declamatory;—as has been declared by Viṣṇusvāmin (?)—(253)</p>

<p>‘<em>Repression</em>’;—the punishment of thieves and others according to rules
laid down in the Scriptures—by the inflicting of corporal and other
forms of punishment;—without which the protection of the people is not
possible.</p>
<p>Hence if the king receives taxes and yet fights shy of repressing
thieves, he incurs the two dangers—in this world, trouble in his
kingdom, and in the next, the loss of Heaven. It is only right that
blame should attach to the King who receives taxes and yet does not

<p><em>Bṛhaspati</em> (22, 2-5).—‘Thieves are of two kinds:—open and secret. These
are subdivided thousand-fold, according to their skill, ability and
<em>modus operandi</em>. Fraudulent traders, quacks, gamblers, corrupt judges,
those who accept bribes, cheats, persons posing as interpreters of omens
or performers of propitiatory rites, mean artists, forgers, hired
servants refusing to do their work, roguish umpires, perjured witnesses,
and jugglers,—these are called <em>open thieves</em>. Housebreakers,
highwaymen, robbers of bipeds and quadrupeds, stealers of clothes and
such things, and stealers of grain,—these are <em>secret thieves</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Theft, 1-5).—‘Two kinds of robbers who steal the goods of
others, have to be distinguished:—the one kind <em>open</em> and the other kind
<em>secret. Open</em> rogues are those who forge measures and weights or
receive bribes, robbers, gamblers, public prostitutes, those who roam
about in disguise, those who make a living by teaching auspicious
ceremonies,—these and such like persons are considered <em>open</em> rogues.
Rogues acting <em>in secret</em> are those who roam in the woods, or he
concealed, as well as those who make a profession of stealing. They
attack and rob people who do not beware of them. Those who infest a
country, a village, or a house, or disturb a sacrificial act, cut
purses, and other persons of this sort also are considered to be <em>secret
rogues</em>.’</p>

<p>Those who are addicted to taking bribes for doing some work for people,
at the royal Court or with ministers etc.</p>
<p>‘<em>Dissemblers</em>.’—efficient in the art of dissembling; saying one thing
and doing another; openly professing love and secretly doing injury.
These persons do not always accept anything; they simply win the
confidence of men by means of such tricks as—having come to know that a
certain business of the man is going to succeed, they go to them and say
‘I am going to do this work for you.’ They also make use of threats
sometimes.</p>
<p>‘<em>Gamblers</em>’—who carry on gambling as a means of adding to their income.</p>
<p>‘<em>Cheats</em>’—those who mislead people; having promised to do a certain
work, they do not do it; and having approached the people of the
village, they adopt various methods to cheat them out of their properly.
To this class belong the persons who are known as ‘<em>Śivamādhavas</em>’; they
make Śiva or Viṣṇu the means of living.</p>
<p>‘<em>Fortune-tellers</em>’—astrologers and foretellers;—or persons who approach
rich men with such words as ‘for your sake I shall win the favour of
Durgā or Sūrya or such other gods and goddesses,’ and making a living by
it. Or, the term may stand for those who make a living by pronouncing
the auspicious formula ‘May this be so.’</p>

Rāghavānanda);—‘those who cheat by using false weights and measures’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).</p>
<p>‘<em>Vañcakāḥ</em>.’—‘Cheats, those who promise to do some thing but don’t do

<p>‘<em>Bhadrāprekṣaṇikāḥ</em>’.—‘Palmists who always praise the fortunes of
others’ (Medhātithi);—Nārāyaṇa, reading ‘<em>bhadrāścekṣaṇikāḥ</em>’, explains
‘<em>bhadrāḥ</em>’ as ‘persons who tempt women’, and ‘<em>īkṣanikāḥ</em>’ as actors

men and cheat people’ and ‘<em>īkṣaṇika</em>’ as palmists.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 291), which adds the
following explanations:—‘<em>Aikṣaṇika</em>’ (which is its reading for
‘<em>īkṣanika</em>’), is that fortune-teller who makes money by making false
agreeable predictions.</p>

<p>‘<em>Others of the same kind</em>’— It is not possible to enumerate each and
every kind of rogue addicted to robbing other persons; hence this
phrase;—<em>e.g</em>., there is one class of men who come and tell a man who is
stricken with a certain woman that she is in love with him, though in
reality she hates him; and another who, though not a servant, behaves as
if he were one, and thus robs a simple-minded man of his gold; others
again who flatter the foolish rich with such words as ‘you are Brahmā,’
‘you are Bṛhaspati’ and cheat them out of their riches; telling him —‘
kindly give me such and such a thing, I shall repay it in a few days’;
and as soon as their business is accomplished, they become scarce, and
hitherto smooth-tongued, become harsh.—(260)</p>

has entered the chamber, he should be followed by certain menials with
arms hidden about their person, who had been previously instructed.
Thereupon the royal door-keepers would enter and under the pretence of
suspecting them, should search their persons; and finding the hidden
arms openly accuse the offender with having hired these men for
assassinating the King. In this manner, imputing crimes to the
offenders, the King shall, for the satisfaction of his subjects, weed
out the thorns from his realm.’</p>
<p><em>Arthaśāstra</em> (p. 135).—‘Spies disguised as ascetics, renunciates,
mendicants, bards and so forth should be employed by the King to find
out the wickedness or otherwise of the people and the King’s officers.
If there is any one whom he suspects of dishonest ways of life, the King
shall have him shadowed by a man of the same caste; when this latter has
won the man’s confidence,—who for example is a judge—he should address
him these words—“Such and such a relation of mine has been accused of an
offence, do please save him from the danger, and here accept this money
for the purpose.” If the judge falls into the trap and accepts the
bribe, he should be banished by the King as one addicted to dishonesty.’</p>
<p><em>Brhaṣpati</em> (22.6).—‘Thieves or robbers, having been found out by the
King’s servants, either by associating with them, or through marks of
their criminality, or by their possessing the stolen goods, they shall
be compelled to restore the plunder and shall be visited with
punishments ordained by the law.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 293).—‘Having found out the thieves and
robbers through clever spies conversant with the methods adopted by
criminals, the King shall follow them up and have them arrested by
secretly instructed spies.’</p>
<p>Do. (Theft: 61).—‘As governor, the King shall extirpate the evil-doers,
after having traced them by the application of cunning stratagems and
arrested them.’</p>

the thief or the robber with food or lodging, or fire, or water, or
advice, or implements, or expenses, he shall be punished with the

<p><em>Gautama</em> (Aparārka, p. 850).—‘The man who advises the thief, or
knowingly receives the stolen goods, is equal to the thief.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 340),—‘Those who buy the vessels or
receive the stolen goods, or those who hide the thieves, are declared to
be subject to the same punishments as the thieves themselves.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (Do.).—‘The King shall put to death those who supply thieves
with food and lodging.’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (14.19).—‘Those who give food or shelter to thieves seeking
refuge with them, or who suffer them to escape, though able to arrest
them, partake of the crime themselves.’</p>
<p>Do. (Theft: 13-14).—‘Those who give food to thieves, as well as those
who supply them with fire or water, or who give shelter, or show the way
to them, or make their defence, or who buy their goods, or receive their
goods, or those who hide them are held to be as punishable as the
thieves themselves.’</p>

hands have been cut off;—in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 316), which adds that

pickpocket detected thrice should be put to death;—in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, p. 87), which adds the following explanations—‘If one is
detected in untying cattle for stealing it, then, if it is the first
offence of its kind, his fingers should be cut off, in the second

<p>‘<em>Tank</em>’—has been mentioned only by way of an illustration.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to the ‘stealing’ of the water of a river
also;—say some people.</p>
<p>This however is not right; because the harm done in the breaking of the
tank is very great; and it is only slight in the case of the breaking of
a river-dam.</p>
<p>The law here laid down applies also to the case of cutting the
embankments of a tank.—(279)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 365), which adds the
following notes—‘<em>Apsu</em>’, <em>i.e</em>., by drowning in
water,—‘<em>śuddhavadhena</em>’, by strangulation or such means of capital
punishment, apart from water;—the penalty of ‘highest amercement’ is to
be inflicted <em>along with</em> that of making him do the necessary repairs.</p>

bridges or drinking pools, the man should be compelled to repair the
damage, to reconsecrate it, and to pay a fine of eight hundred.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (2.278).—‘A woman who is very sinful, or who procures
abortion, or kills men, or who breaks a dam, should be drowned in water
with a stone tied round her neck.’</p>
<p>Do. (2.273).—‘Those who steal elephants or horses should be impaled.’</p>
<p><em>Kātyāyana</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 367).—‘One who breaks a wall, or

damages a temple, he should be fined the first amercement.’</p>
<p><em>Vāysa</em> (Aparārka, p. 845).—‘The stealer of a horse should be put to
death by having his hands, feet and loin cut off; one who steals cattle
shall have half of his foot cut off with a sharp instrument.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (Vivādaratnākara, p. 320).—‘One who steals a cow, or a horse, or
an elephant shall have his one hand and one foot cut off; and one who

<p><em>Viṣṇu</em> (Do., p. 365).—‘Those cutting a dam should be put to death.’</p>
<p><em>Yama</em> (Aparārka, p. 822).—‘If one takes away the water of a tank or
destroys the inlet of water, he should he made to pay the first

water, etc., (as in Manu 279).’</p>

<p>In regard to certain substances it has been declared that in exchanges
they shall be treated as equivalent:—<em>e.g</em>., Sesamum and paddy have been
declared to be equal; if in regard to such articles, some one treats
them as <em>unequal</em>—<em>i.e</em>., having advanced sesamum, he receives in
payment a larger quantity of paddy;—or even when there is no exchange,
in the act of buying and selling, if one buys sesamum at a price higher
than that given for paddy;—or in a case when one man has an upper
garment for sale, and another an under-clothing, and the latter stands
in need of the latter,—though the two are of equal value, yet knowing
the greater need of the man with the upper garment, the latter offers to
him the under-clothing, but not in equal exchange, but for a higher
price,—such a man is said to ‘<em>treat equals as unequals</em>’ in value.</p>
<p>The punishments prescribed are for both the buyer and the seller; since
both are parties to the act of ‘treating equals as unequals.’</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>vā</em>’, in this case is superfluous, serving only to fill up
the metre.</p>
<p>The two alternative fines—the ‘first’ and the ‘middlemost’—are laid
down, as to be determined by the value of the commodities
concerned.—(287)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 825), which adds the following
explanations:—That man suffers the ‘first amercement’ who deals with
honest, customers—who pay the right price—dishonestly, giving them
cheaper articles; and the ‘middle amercement’ is the penalty for the man
who, selling the right commodity, receives a higher or lower price.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 296), which adds the following
explanation:—The man, who, receiving the same price from a number of
purchasers, sells to them articles of varying, qualities, suffers the
‘first amercement’; and the man who sells commodities of the same
quality to a number of persons, but charges them varying prices, suffers
the ‘middle amercement It goes on to quote Halāyudha as explaining (with
Medhātithi) the verse to mean that the man who deals dishonestly;
‘<em>viṣamam</em>’—<em>i.e</em>. in exchanging things with a man, he, taking advantage
of the needs of the other party, gives less of his own commodity and
receives more of that of the other man,—when in reality both commodities
are recognised to be of equal value,—or when the vendor, taking
advantage of the needs of the customer, sells to him a cheaper article
at a higher price,—he should suffer either the ‘first’ or the ‘middle’
amercement, according to the value of the commodity concerned. It is
quoted in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em> (Calcutta, p. 80), which explains ‘<em>samaiḥ</em>’
as ‘ordinary’, and adds the explanation—‘one who replaces a valuable
article by an ordinary one, should fined 250 <em>Paṇas</em> if the other party
is put to a loss of the seventh part of his outlay, and 500 <em>Paṇas</em> if
the loss is the fifth part or more’.</p>

<p>‘<em>Malevolent rite</em>,’— encompassing death by such superphysical means as
incantations and the like. If anyone performs such a rite, he shall
receive the prescribed punishment, if the person aimed at does not die
off. But in the case of such rites being successful, the man cannot
escape with such a simple punishment. In that case the penalty shall be
the same as that for ‘man-slaughter.’</p>
<p>The term ‘<em>all</em>’ is meant to imply that the same punishment is to be
inflicted in the case of <em>Vedic</em> as well as <em>non-Vedic</em> rites;—<em>Śyena</em>
and other sacrifies being the ‘<em>Vedic</em> malevolent rites,’ and the
‘taking of the foot-dust’, ‘pricking with a needle’ the <em>non-Vedic</em>
ones.</p>
<p>‘<em>Magic spells</em>’— such as ‘bringing under control’ and so forth.</p>
<p>‘<em>Persons related</em>’ are the son, the wife and such relations of the
victim; other than these are the ‘<em>presons</em> <em>not related</em>.’</p>
<p>‘<em>Sorcery</em>’ also is only a form of ‘malevolent rite,’ consisting of
‘expulsion’ and such ends as ‘bringing about feelings of disgust against
friends and relations,’ ‘insanity’ and other similar magical effects
brought about by means of incantations.—(290)</p>

<p>He who sells as ‘seed’ what is ‘<em>not seed</em>,’ by concealing its real
character. It is after the lapse of a long term that seeds germinate in
the field; so that it cannot be ascertained whether or not they are real
‘seeds.’</p>
<p>‘<em>He who picks out seed</em>’—good seed germinates quickly; the offender
therefore picks out the good seed and sells the remaining bad ones. Or,
the meaning may be that the man ‘<em>picks up the seeds</em>’ that have been
sown in the field and takes them away.</p>
<p>‘<em>Bounds</em>’—rules and practices sanctioned by scriptures and usage.</p>
<p>‘<em>Mutilation</em>’—cutting off of ears, nose etc.—(291)</p>

<p>Buhler remarks “all the commentators give more or less correct
readings”,—and declares that the correct reading “seems to be”
‘<em>bījotkraṣṭā</em>’. This is amusing to read, when we find Medhātithi,
Nārāyaṇa, Rāghvānanda, Nandana and Rāmacandra all adapting the reading
‘<em>bījotkraṣṭā</em>’.</p>
<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 296), which adds the
following notes:—‘<em>Abījavikrayī</em>’, one who sells, as <em>seed</em>, com which
is unfit for sowing,—‘<em>bījotkarṣī</em>’, one who forcibly takes out the seed
that has been sown,—‘<em>maryādabhedakaḥ</em>’, one who transgresses the
customs of his country, caste and family, the scriptures and popular
practices,—‘<em>vikṛtam vadham</em>’, corporal punishment in the form of the
cutting off of ears and other limbs of the body.</p>
<p>It is quoted in <em>Aparārka</em> (p. 825), which explains ‘<em>abījavikrayī</em>’ as
‘one who sells as seed what is not seed’,—and ‘<em>bījotkraṣṭā</em>’ as ‘one
who digs out seed that has been already sown’;—and in <em>Vivādacintāmaṇi</em>
(Calcutta, p. 81), which adds the explanation—‘He who (<em>a</em>) sells as
<em>seed</em> what is not <em>seed</em>, or (<em>b</em>) takes forcible possession of a field
sown by another, or (<em>c</em>) breaks a local or tribal or family custom, or
a scriptural or royal injunction, should have his ears and nose and
other limbs cut off.</p>

<p>Of all the ‘thorns’ described above, the goldsmith is <em>the worst</em>’</p>
<p><em>Question</em>’.—If what is meant is the <em>selection</em> (of the ‘goldsmith from
among the ‘thorns’),—then why should not the compounding (in
‘<em>Sarvakaṇṭakapāpiṣṭham</em>’) be avoided [in obedience to <em>Pāṇini</em>
2.2.10]?</p>
<p>What is meant by his being ‘the worst of sinners’ is that the stealing
of a small quantity of gold involves a great sin, while the stealing of
gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa involves ‘the most heinous crime.’</p>
<p>For this reason, if the goldsmith behaves dishonestly, ‘<em>he shall be cut
to pieces</em>.’ Goldsmiths steal gold by manipulating the scales and during
the processes of heating and cutting.</p>
<p>In this case, considerations of the quantity stolen, or the caste of the
owner do not enter; repetition alone has to be taken into consideration;
<em>e.g</em>., in the ease of the first offence a fine shall be substituted for
the slicing of flesh with a razor.</p>
<p>It has already been explained that in the case of corporal punishment,
the sin disappears by virtue of the punishment inflicted—(292)</p>

<p>This verse is quoted in <em>Mitākṣarā</em> (2. 297), which adds that it refers

of a goldsmith stealing gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa;—in
<em>Vivādaratnākara</em> (p. 309), which explains ‘<em>Kaṇṭaka</em>’ as an open thief,
and adds that people have held that the penalty prescribed being very

therewith are the plough, the spade and so forth. For the stealing of
these punishment has to be inflicted.</p>
<p>Is this to be done arbitrarily? No; ‘<em>after taking into consideration

hand, the punishment shall be severe; and severer still when the field
has been already cultivated and a rich harvest is in prospect.</p>
<p>‘<em>Taking into consideration</em>’—having ascertained its advent. Under other
circumstances, the punishment shall be in accordance with the nature of
the object stolen.</p>

at the time of war, the punishment shall be severe;—or in the ease of
‘<em>medicines</em>’— if they are stolen at the time that they are going to be
actually administered,—and the chances are that if the medicine is
stolen and not administered, the patient shall suffer great pain;—and no
other medicine is available at the time,—and even if available, it
requires a long time for its preparation;—all these circumstances have
to be taken into consideration when determining the punishment.</p>
<p>In the case of ‘arms’, if they belong to the king,—or to persons who are
in constant dread of enemies and robbers (and hence need the arms for

if law-suits are justly disposed of and thorns are effectively removed.
Then again, in most cases the ‘thorns’—<em>i.e</em>., the worst
criminals—consist of persons attached to the Queen or to the Princes, to
the king’s favourities or to the commanders of armies and so forth; and
it is possible that the king may not remove this, being guided by some
such notion as—‘In the event of a dangerous upheaval among the people I
shall have great need for the army-commander, or for the tributary
chief,—why should I punish him, simply for some offence against the
people?’—and it is in view of this that the author is proceeding with
the subjects of the ‘constituents’ of the kingdom. And from what
follows, it is clear that the <em>People</em> stand on the same footing as the
<em>King</em> himself,—being as much a ‘constituent’ of the kingdom as the
latter; though there may be some difference in the degree of their
relative importance. For instance, if there is disurbance among the
people due to some act of the <em>Minister</em>, this should be suppressed;
because the people are of greater importance than the <em>Minister</em>; or,
the king may desist from hasty action, and try to find out the^(‘)thorn’
and remove him. it is for this reason that portions of the teachings
contained in Discourse VII ate extracted and set forth in the present
connection.</p>
<p>‘<em>Master</em>’—<em>i.e</em>. the King himself.</p>
<p>‘<em>Minister</em>’—the Councillor, the Priest, the Army-Commander.</p>
<p>‘<em>Capital City</em>’—the city containing the king’s residence.</p>
<p>‘<em>People</em>’—the public.</p>
<p>‘<em>Treasury</em>’—store of gold and silver and other valuables.</p>
<p>^(‘)<em>Army</em>’—consisting of elephants, horses and foot-soldiers.</p>
<p>^(‘)<em>Ally</em>’—one having the same end in view: as has been
described^(‘)next to him comes the Ally.’</p>
<p>These are the ‘<em>constituents</em>’—causes, components—of the kingdom; in the
same manner as the potsherds are of the jar.</p>
<p>Or the term ‘<em>prakṛti</em>’ may he taken as standing for
‘<em>svabhāva</em>,’^(‘)nature;’ the sense in that case would be that the
kingdom <em>is of the nature</em> of these.</p>
<p>It is these seven that have been divided into seventy-two parts, the
details of which have been already described.—(294)</p>

<p>That is to say, any harm coming to the King’s own army is more serious
than that of the Ally. If he is himself fully fit, the King can go to
the rescue of his Ally.</p>
<p>Similarly as between the Treasury and the Army,—injury to the Treasury
means positive injury to the Army.</p>
<p>And between ‘Treasury’ and the ‘People,’—if the People are injured,
whence would the ‘Treasury’ derive its existence? Similarly when the
whole People are in danger, all effort should be concentrated on the
saving of the ‘Capital City,’ as it is there that all the accessories of
the kingdom can he brought together. The ‘Minister’ again is more
important than the ‘Capital City;’ as the destruction of the Chief
Minister may bring destruction to the entire kingdom.—(295)</p>

<p>An example is cited—‘<em>interlaced like the Triple Staff</em>—<em>i.e</em>., each is
dependent upon the other. This same idea is further emphasised—‘<em>since
their qualities are mutually helpful</em>;’—inasmuch as they are helpful to
one another, there can be no distinction among them; just as there is
none among the soil, the seed and the water, in the process of
cultivation.</p>
<p>From this it follows that special attention is to be paid to every one
of the seven limbs.</p>
<p>There certainly is some difference in their relative importance; what
then is meant by the assertion that ‘<em>no one of them is superior</em>’ is
that due care should always be taken in the guarding of the Ally and
other ‘limbs’ also (which, in the preceding verse, have been declared to
be of minor importance). Because the destruction of the Ally also would
eventually lead to the destruction of the King’s own kingdom, specially
when the attack upon the former comes from a powerful quarter; even
though the danger may be not so imminent.—(296)</p>

<p>**(verses 9.313-322)<br>
**</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata</em> (13.152.16, 21-23).—‘Brāhmaṇas depend upon the Kṣatriya,
not the Kṣatriya on the Brāhmaṇa. There is none who can deprive me—says
Arjuna—of any kingdom; I am therefore superior to the Brāhmaṇa.’</p>
<p>Do. (12.56.24).—(Same as Manu 321.)</p>
<p>Do. (12.78.21).—(Same as Manu 320.)</p>
<p><em>Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa</em> (4.1.4.4-6.)</p>
<p><em>Gautama</em> (11.14).—‘It is declared in the Veda—“Kṣatriyas, who are
assisted by Brāhmaṇas, prosper and do not fall into distress.”’</p>
<p><em>Vaśiṣṭha</em> (19.4).—‘It is declared in the Veda—“A realm where a Brāhmaṇa
is appointed domestic priest prospers.”’</p>
<p><em>Nārada</em> (18.12).—‘On account of their dignity and sanctity, it is not
permitted to either advise or rebuke a King or a Brāhmaṇa, unless they
swerve from the path of duty.’</p>
<p>Do. (18.34-39).—‘Let a king be constantly intent upon showing honour to
the Brāhmaṇas; a field furnished with Brāhmaṇas is the root of the
prosperity of the world. A Brāhmaṇa may command respect and a
distinguished seat at the King’s Court; the King shall show his face in
the morning before the Brāhmaṇas first of all, and shall salute them
all.—When nine or seven persons meet, they shall first make room for the
Brāhmaṇa to pass by. Brāhmaṇas shall also have free access to the houses
of other people, for the purpose of begging alms; also the right to
collect fuel, flowers, water and the like, without its being regarded as
<em>theft</em>,—and to converse with men’s wives, without restraint;—and also
the right to cross rivers without paying any fare, and to be conveyed to
the other bank before other people. When engaged in trading and using a
ferryboat, they shall pay no toll.—A Brāhmaṇa engaged in travelling, who
is tired and has nothing to eat, commits no wrong by taking two canes of
sugar or two esculent roots.’</p>
<p><em>Arthaśāstra</em> (1.47).—‘The Kṣatriya Power is gloriously victorious when
it is augmented by the Brāhmaṇas, embellished by the counsel of
ministers, and supported by the deductions of the scriptures.’</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu-dharmottara</em> (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 150).—‘The King shall
never take a Brāhmaṇa’s property; he shall always protect it&hellip;. Even
though the Brāhmaṇa be devoid of learning or of vicious conduct, he
shall never bear ill-will towards him.’</p>

with the Kṣatriya females a new Kṣatriya race after the destruction of
the second <em>varṇa</em> by Paraśurāma.”—Buhler.</p>

<p>When the King begins to be harassed by old age, if be finds that he has
done all that he bad to do,—then if he has any wealth,—such as that
accumulated from fines—he shall give all this away to <em>Brāhmaṇas</em>. As
for fines realised from the ‘heinous offenders,’ it has been already
laid down that they shall be disposed of by being offered to Varuṇa, and
none of it shall be taken by the King himself. But when he finds that
apart from this there is much wealth that has accumulated from all kinds
of fines,—and he realises that his death is approaching,—he should
dispose of the wealth in the manner here described.</p>
<p>Others have explained that the term ‘<em>fines</em>’ is meant to include all
sources of income—such as taxes, tolls and the like.</p>
<p>According to this the meaning would be that he should give away all his
wealth; that is, he should give away everything, with the exception of
chariots, arms, lands and slaves.</p>
<p>Under this explanation, the clause, ‘making over the kingdom to his son’
would not be quite consistent Because it would be impossible for the son
to carry on the administration, with a depleted treasury.</p>
<p>‘<em>Bring about his departure in battle</em>,’—<em>i.e</em>., he shall go forth to
battle, with a view to give up his life. If even towards the end of his
life, he finds no chances for a battle, then he should destroy his body
either in fire or water. But the best results would be attained by
giving up the body in battle.—(323)</p>

<p>The tending of cattle is not only a means of <em>livelihood</em> for the
Vaiśya; it also forms his <em>duty</em>. This is what is indicated by this
declamatory passage.</p>
<p>“How is it that the author should impose an invisible (transcedental)
character upon what is quite visible?”</p>
<p>It has been done with a view to bringing it home to the Vaiśya that he
must, as an obligation, do the tending of cattle, in the same manner as
the <em>Kṣatriya</em> does the protecting of the people.</p>
<p>How the protecting of the people is binding upon the <em>Kṣatriya</em> has
already been explained before. As for the <em>Brāhmaṇa</em>, he is entitled to
all sorts of ‘protection,’ by virtue of his being the person who
prescribes the necessary expiatory rites, performs prayers, offers
oblations and thereby obtains min from the sun, and so forth.</p>
<p>What is stated here is only by way of illustration; and all that is
meant is that the tending of cattle forms the duty of the Vaiśya.—(327)</p>

<p>“Why should there be any question of <em>willing</em> regarding what forms a
means of livelihood? It has been already pointed out that, even though
there is a transcendental factor in the matter, yet stress is laid upon
only the visible aspect; just as in the case of the rule regarding
<em>facing the East</em> during meals. It is in view of this that the text
says—‘<em>The Vaiśya shall never conceive the wish</em>.’ So that if the Vaiśya
is not in want of a livelihood, he shall not incur any sin (in being
unwilling to tend cattle.)”</p>
<p>True; but the author has used the particular words with a view to show
that the duty of tending of cattle does not stand on the same
footing—and is to be regarded as leading to the same results—as that of
‘cultivating the land,’ along with which ‘cattle-tending’ has been
mentioned before; and hence men may be led to regard all of them as
leading to the same results. And according to the view that they are all
conducive to the same results, ‘wish’ also would come in as a
determining factor; specially when the man is one who may be hankering
after other actions. In a ease where ‘cattle-tending’ is the most
profitable means of livelihood, the man would naturally have recourse to
it, and not engage in other kinds of work; he would naturally live by
the said means of livelihood. (?)—(328)</p>

<p>**(verses 9.333-336)<br>
**</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇupurāṇa</em> (Parāśaramādhava-Ācāra, p. 419).—‘It is only through
attending upon the twice-born that the Śūdra becomes entitled to perform
the <em>Pākayajñas</em>; and thereby becoming blessed, he wins the worlds.—The
Śūdra also shall make gifts, and perform the Pākayajña-sacrifices, as
also the rites in honour of Pitṛs.’</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata</em>—<em>Anuśāsana</em> (Do.).—‘Finding the Śūdra oppressed with bad
traits due to the quality of Tamas, Pitāmaha ordained attendance upon
the twice-born as his duty. Through his devotion to the twice-born, the
Śūdra drops off all those traits due to the quality of Tamas; and by
attending upon the twice-born, the Śūdra attains the highest
good.—Harmless, devoted to good deeds, worshipful towards gods and the
twice-born, the Śūdra becomes endowed with all the rewards of Dharma.’</p>
<p><em>Mahābhārata—Śānti</em> (Parāśaramādhava-Ācāra, p. 420).—‘The syllables
<em>svāhā</em> and <em>namaḥ</em> are the mantras prescribed for the Śūdra; by means
of these shall the Śūdra offer the Pākayajña-Sacrifices; he shall never
amass wealth; having acquired wealth by service, he shall win the
affection of his elders; and if he is righteously inclined, he may make
gifts when permitted to do so by the King.’</p>
<p><em>Yājñavalkya</em> (Do., p. 419).—‘Attached to his wife, pure, supporting his
dependants, devoted to the performance of Śrāddhas, he should never omit
to perform the Five Sacrifices by means of ths mantra <em>namaḥ</em>.’</p>
<p>Do. (Do., p. 422).—‘If he cannot make a living by service of the
twice-born, the Śūdra may become a trader, or obtain a living by means
of the arts, always acting for the welfare of the twice-born.’</p>
<p><em>Parāśara</em> (Ācāra, 65).—‘The Śūdra may make a living by the sale of
salt, honey, oil, curds, <em>takra</em>, clarified butter and milk.—But the
Śūdra becomes immediately degraded by selling wine and flesh, by eating
what should not he eaten, and by approaching women who should not be
approached. The Śūdra falls immediately by drinking the milk of the
<em>Kapilā</em> cow, by approaching a Brāhmaṇa woman and by pronouncing the
words of the Veda.’</p>

M G J read: yac chiṣṭaṃ pitṛdāyebhyaḥ pradānikam ( thus omitting darvarṇaṃ paitṛkam . . . kanyābhyaś ca).
