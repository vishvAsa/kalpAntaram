*   MDh _mūla_ (root-text): **BOLD**
*   _mūla _text cited in commentary: **BOLD**
*   Names of authors and texts: RED
*   Citations from other texts: BLUE
*   Pūrvapakṣa, Uttarapakṣa, and different views: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">underlined</span>
*   Introductory comments that precede the _mūla _verses are given in _italics_.
*   I have traced the citations wherever possible; I would greatly appreciate if readers can identify those that I have not been able to, especially the Vedic citation.
