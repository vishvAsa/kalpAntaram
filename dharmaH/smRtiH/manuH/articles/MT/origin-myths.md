Early History of the MDS and the origin mythologies contained in it


## Intro
Like all dharma shAstras or books of Hindu Law, the mAnava dharma shAstra (MDS) or the manu smRti is mainly concerned with the regulation of the life of an Indo-Aryan. The dharma shAstras have been extensively studied to understand various aspects of ancient Indian life and have also come under uninformed criticism by the various enemies of the Hindus determined find defects in Hindu thought. 

## Comparison
Rather than assessing the dharma shAstras (DSs) by modern standards and constructs, it would be more appropriate to compare their socially relevant contents against other ancient and medieval law-books. Systems that lend themselves to more or less equal comparisons to the dharma shAstras are vi-diev-dat of the ancient Iranians, the laws of Hammurabi and the imperfectly known Mongolian Yasa of Chingiz Kha’khan. 

## Application
It appears plausible that the laws ordained by the DSs were actually close to practices current during the Mauryan era. They appear to have attained a near pan-Indian distribution[1] in this phase. In the subsequent epochs they appear to have even taken root outside of India in the Far Eastern and Central Asian colonies of the Indians[2]. However, their sway, in these later epochs, particularly during the Gupta and even later Chola periods was largely theoretical, with a more important role for the local laws of the self-governing units within the Hindu empires. Nevertheless, the DSs played an important role in the development of Hindu cultural unity over India.


## Amendments
Unlike the Vedic literature, but more like the itihAsa-purANa genre of Sanskrit literature, the DSs were prone to extensive amendments and corruptions over time. On account of this historical conclusions can be drawn from them only after the various layers present in them are determined and their relative chronology understood. 

## Goal
In this work we shall mainly concentrate on one of the foremost of the dharma shastras, namely that of manu, that contains some additional material beyond the usual concerns of the DSs. The idea here is not to discuss Hindu law, but some historical conclusions that may be drawn from the MDS. 

## kShatriya origin
Most dharma shastras and the related aphoristic dharma sutras have as their authors well known Indo-Aryan encyclopedists such as Apastambha, kAtyAyana, gautama and the like. However, the MDS unlike these is attributed to manu, the legendary ancestor of all the kshatriyas or by some accounts even the legendary common ancestor of all humans or all life forms.



This attribution itself provides an interesting lead regarding the history of the MDS tradition. Vidievdat, the analogous law-book of the ancient Iranians is attributed to Yima Kshaeta (the primal ‘kshatriya’ of the Iranians) the son of Vivahvant. In the Indo-Aryan world manu the primal kshatriya, like yama, is considered a son of vivasvAn. In this context it is interesting to note that the medieval dharma shAstra digests quote a now nearly lost smRti text, the yama smRti[3]. Thus, there is evidence for the parallel existence of a ‘yama’ counterpart of the MDS even amidst the Indo-Aryans. Taken together, it appears possible that the MDS at its core represents an essentially Indo-Iranian tradition wherein the social laws and taboos were attributed to the primal being, the son of vivasvAn. 

## Purity concern
Consistent with this, both the Iranian Vidievdat and the MDS are obsessed with ritual purity and purification of various objects through ablutions and other means. Comparisons between the taboos and practices of the Roman priests- the Flamen dialis and the Indo-Aryan brAhmaNas show a rather precise match[4], suggesting that codification of ritual taboos and priestly behavior had already emerged in the early Indo-European period. This is consistent with the reconstructed word Proto-Indo-European word for a priest *bhragsmen from which brAhmaNa and Flamen are likely to have descended.+++(5)+++ This implies that it is likely that even prior to the Indo-Iranian period there was a body of social laws and institutes of priestly and regal conduct that were already quite well established and constituted what may be called the proto-manu smRti. Given this conclusion can we identify any material in the extant MDS text that may be a remnant of this ancient period?

## Cosmogony
The MDS is rather distinct from number of other dharma texts in providing a cosmogonic origin mythology at the beginning of the text. There are several cosmogonic concepts seen in the Vedic texts are combined together in the MDS. One of these that can be termed puruSha origin myth appears to be a very primitive one, traceable to the PIE period and is considerable interest in this context. The puruSha origin myth is clearly expounded in the puruSha sUktaM (RV 10.90) that in its core consists of the primal being- puruSha gives rise to social order in the earthly plane and cosmic order on the universal plane. This view is remarkably reflected in MDS.31-32:

‘*With a view to the development of the regions*.’ terrestrial and the
rest;—‘*development*’ stands for *Nourishment* and *expansion*; it is
only when the four castes, Brāhmaṇa and the rest, are there that there
is development of the three regions; for the Gods live upon offerings
made by these castes,—these castes alone being entitled to the
performance of sacrifices; so that the action done by these nourishes
the two regions (celestial and subterranean); then again, the Gods also
are prompted by men’s action to act; from the Sun-God comes rain; and
thus the said creation (of the Brāhmaṇa) tends to the nourishment of
this (terrestrial) region also.

‘*He brought unto existence*,’—*i.e*., produced, the Brāhmaṇa and other
castes,—‘*from out of his mouth, arm*’, *thighs and feet*’ respectively;
*i.e*., the Brāhmaṇa from out of his mouth, the Kṣatriya out of his
arms, the Vaiśya out of his thighs and the Śūdra out of his feet.—The
affix ‘*tasi*’ (*in* ‘*mukha* *bāhārupādataḥ*’) has the sense of the
Ablative; the effect is, as it were, drawn out of the cause; and this
implying a sort of *separation*, the use of the Ablative becomes fully
justified.

It was only a certain primeval Brāhmaṇa whom Prajāpati produced, by his
divine power, out of the component particles of his own mouth; because
so far as the Brāhmaṇas of the present day are concerned, they are all
actually found to he produced by intercourse between human couples, out
of the material principles.

In reality however, what is stated here is merely commendatory, intended
to show the relative superiority and inferiority of the castes;—the
meaning being—‘of all beings Prajāpati is the highest,—among all the
limbs of Prajāpati, the mouth is the highest,—similarly the Brāhmaṇa is
the highest, most praiseworthy, of all the castes;’ and on the basis of
this similarity the Brāhmaṇa is described as produced out of Brahma’s
mouth.

Or, the description of the Brāhmaṇa coming out of Brahma’s mouth may be
due to the fact that the work of the mouth, such as teaching and the
like, belongs preeminently to the Brāhmaṇa; to the Kṣatriya belongs the
work of the arms, lighting; to the Vaiśya the work of the thighs, such
as wandering about with the cows, when tending cattle, and also
travelling for trade on land and water; and to the Śūdra belongs the
work of the feet, *i.e*., service.—(31)

‘*Lokavivṛddhyartham*’—‘in order that the inhabitants of the worlds
might *multiply* (or *prosper*)’—(Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘in order to protect the world by means of the castes, and to
make it prosperous’ (Nārāyaṇa).

It is refreshing to find Medhātithi regarding this account of the castes
issuing from the mouth and other parts of the body of the Lord as mere
‘*stuti*’—not to be taken as literally true.

The creation described here is apparently of another Being; but others
have held that it is of the same *Brahmā*; the meaning being that the
body that came out of the Egg being divided into two halves, ‘*with one
half he became Male*’—*i.e*., he became a male being, capable of
instilling semen—and ‘*with the other half he became the Female*’; that
is, his body assumed the form of the Hermaphrodite, like *Gaurī-Śaṅkara*
(combined in a single body). Or, it may mean that he crested the Female
apart (from the Male).—Having created her, he produced, from her, by the
act of procreation, that being whose well-known name is ‘*Virāj*.’ What
is meant is that Prajāpati had recourse to his own daughter.

This mention of the bifurcation of Prajāpati’s body is based upon the
fact that the husband and wife differ only in their bodies, and in all
functions they are entirely united.—(32)

The ‘Virāṭ’ whose birth is here described is, according to some, the
same as,—and according to others, different from—the ‘Brahmā’ described
above, in verse 9. That Medhātithi leans towards the latter view is
indicated by his assertion that what happened was that ‘the body of
Brahmā (described in verse 9) now took the form of the
Hermaphrodite,’—or as he adds later, ‘the Female form was separated from
His own Male form.’

In the puruSha suktaM we are told that virAj is the primal puruSha (virAjo adhi pUrushaH). Thus the MDS directly reproduces the puruSha mythology expressed in the RV in addition introduces the concept of the virAj emerging from an androgynous twin form (divdhA kRtva) form the primal being.



This offers a connection with yima-the Iranian counterpart of manu. Yima is derived from the PIE word *yema, meaning twin and is attested in words like Jemini (twin in Greek- via a common y->j transform).  
Even in the Rgveda, there is a whole hymn where yama is paired with his female twin yamI (RV 10.10).  
Similarly in Nordic mythology we are told that the primary male- female pair- “realm of frost” (Niflheimr) and “realm of fire” (Muspellheimr) gave rise to the giant primal figure Ymir. Ymir is directly derived from proto-Germanic *Yuminaz and is equivalent to yama or yima. 

The Roman observer, Tacitus, in his book Germania (chapter 2) describing the mythology of the primitive Germans mentions that the primal twin gave rise to the primal man Mannus (equivalent of manu). Mannus spawned, in turn, the progenitors of the 3 strata of ancient German society- the Ingaevones, Herminones and Istaevones, like the brahmins, kshatriyas and vaishyas. Thus we may conclude that the MDS retains some material from a very ancient stratum of IE existence.


### RV10 parallels
The MDS contains additional cosmogonic material that also have strong parallels in the 10th maNDala of the Rgveda and are well developed only amidst the Indo-Aryans. The first of these is the concept of the origin of the universe from the hiraNyagarbha (MDS-9).

First of all Primordial Matter develops in the form of Clay; *i.e*., on
account of the contact of Hiraṇyagarbha’s ‘seed,’ it become solidified;
and this is what is described as having become an ‘*egg*.’—‘Golden,’
gold, made up of gold; *i.e*., in its brilliance it resembled the thing
made of gold.

“But this statement (that the egg was of gold) is contained in the
scriptures, and we do not find any such term as ‘like’ or ‘resembling’
(which would have justified the interpretation of ‘golden’ as
*resembling* *gold*),—how then can we, in the absence of any other
authority, explain the term figuratively?”

Our answer to the question is as follows:—Later on we find the
statement—‘by means of the two forces, he created Heaven and Earth’
(Verse 13); and as a matter of fact, this Earth is found to consist of
clay, and not of gold entirely; and it is in view of this fact that we
have taken the epithet ‘golden’ figuratively.

‘*Sahasrāṃśuḥ*,’ lit. ‘thousand-rayed,’ is the Sun;—‘*aṃśu*’ means
*rays*; and the resplendence of the egg was like that of the rays of the
Sun.

‘*In that egg he himself was born*,’ came into existence, *as
Brahmā*,’—Brahmā is Hiraṇyagarbha himself;—the exact signification of
the term ‘himself’ has already been explained; the meaning is that he
had originally (as Hiraṇyagarbha) assumed a body by the force of occult
powers, he gave up that body and entered within the egg.—Or, it may be
that when he created water, Hiraṇyagarbha had no body, hence he took up
a body within the egg.—Or again, the being spoken of as ‘he who’ (in
verse 7) was different from the Brahmā who is described here as being
born in the egg; this would be in keeping with what is going to be
stated (in verse 11) in regard to the latter being ‘created by him,’
*i.e*., created by the Supreme Lord (described in verse 7).

“But (under this last explanation) how could he be said to be ‘himself
born?’—and the text apparently speaks, as ‘Brahmā,’ of him who was
‘*himself born*’ (in the egg).”

This does not affect the position; the son is often called by the name
of the Father, when he is described as the ‘self being born out of
itself.’

The fact of the matter however is that what the Teacher has asserted is
based upon scriptural texts, which have no bearing upon the matter at
all \[for being mere *Arthavāda*, they are not meant to describe what is
directly expressed by the words\]; so Unit we need not lay stress upon
what is said (in the text) in this connection; specially because, so far
as the expounding of Duties is concerned, it does not matter at all
whether Hiraṇyagarbha himself was born in the egg, or he created some
other being.

‘*The grand-father of the whole world*’—is a proper name, applied
figuratively. That it has to be taken so is proved by the fact that the
Being described is not literally the ‘Grandfather’ of the people; what
the attributing of this proper name is meant to indicate is that the
being described is an object of great reverence, the term ‘Grand-father’
being chosen, because the Grand-father commands greater reverence than
even the Father. (9).

Burnell remarks that this ‘Egg’ does not belong to the Sāṅkhya
philosophy. The explanation of this, in accordance with that philosophy,
is thus given by Medhātithi, under verse 11—‘*Sarvataḥ pradhānaṃ
pṛthivyādibhūtotpattau kāṭhinyameti aṇḍarūpam sampadyate*.’

*Haimam*—The commentators are agreed that this is used figuratively, in
the sense of *pure* or *brilliant*.

*Jajñe svayam Brahmā*—(a) ‘He himself was born as Brahmā’, or (b)
‘Brahmā himself was born.’

There has been a great deal of confusion in the mind of modern scholars
in connection with the ‘Golden Egg’,—much of which would have been
avoided if the figurative character of the term had been recognised.

*Medhātithi* P. 11. l. 22 ‘*Anidamparebhyaḥ*—& c.’—Cf. what has been
said in the Bhāṣya on verse 5, to the effect that ‘the process of
creation here described is in some places in agreement with the Purāṇas,
while in others, in accordance with the doctrine of the Saṅkhyas.’ It is
this want of consistency that has led Medhātithi to regard the whole of
this discourse as purely ‘*arthavāda*.’

This (World) was in existence in the form, as it were, of dense Darkness,—unperceived, undifferentiated, incogitable, (hence) incognizable; as it was wholly merged in deep sleep.—(5).


“Where we began and whereto we are carried! Manu was asked to expound the duties laid down in the scriptures, and he promised to expound them; under the circumstances, the description of the world in its undifferentiated state (with which the present verse begins) is wholly irrelevant and purposeless. In fact it becomes a true case of the well-known proverb —‘ Being questioned about mangoes, he describes the Kovidāra tree.’ Further, there is no authority in support of what is here described; nor is any useful purpose served by it. So the whole of this First Discourse need not be studied at all.”

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

At the very outset there arises an objection—

&gt; “Where we began and whereto we are carried! Manu was asked to expound
&gt; the duties laid down in the scriptures, and he promised to expound
&gt; them; under the circumstances, the description of the world in its
&gt; undifferentiated state (with which the present verse begins) is wholly
&gt; irrelevant and purposeless. In fact it becomes a true case of the
&gt; well-known proverb —‘ Being questioned about mangoes, he describes the
&gt; Kovidāra tree.’ Further, there is no authority in support of what is
&gt; here described; nor is any useful purpose served by it. So the whole
&gt; of this First Discourse need not be studied at all.”

Our answer to the above is follows:—What the First Discourse does is to
describe the fact of the Treatise having an extensive scope; so that
what is described here is the whole range of the cosmic process,
beginning with Brahman down to the inanimate objects, as forming the
basis of *Dharma* and *Adharma*, Right and Wrong; for instance, verse 49
describes the vegetable objects as ‘wrapped in manifold Darkness, the
result of their own acts’ \[which shows that plants also are related to,
and affected by, Right and Wrong\]; and later on, again in Discourse 1,
verse 23, it will be stated that ‘having recognised, by means of his
intellect, these transitions of the individual soul, through merit and
demerit, (Right and Wrong), one should fix his attention upon the
Right.’ From all this it follows that Right is the cause of superiority
(in the scale of existence) and Wrong of the reverse; thus the present
treatise, expounding the exact nature of Right and Wrong, serves an
extensive purpose, and as such should be studied. Such is the purport of
the First Discourse.

The authority for what is declared in the present verse consists of
*Mantra, Arthavāda* and *Inference*. As for the *Mantra* we have the
following (in *Ṛgveda*, 10.129.3)—‘Darkness existed, enveloped in
darkness, uncognised in the beginning; this whole existed in a fluid
state; the gross was contained in the subtile; the one entity that
existed came to lie born, by virtue of austerities.’ The meaning is as
follows:—‘At the Universal Dissolution, the Sun, the Moon, the Fire and
other sources of light having been destroyed, there existed Darkness
alone;—this (subtile) Darkness was ‘enveloped,’ wrapped, in Darkness in
the gross form; at this time there was no cogniser; hence, there being
no one to cognise things, there was no *cognition* of anything;
therefore Darkness is described as enveloped in darkness;—‘in the
beginning,’ *i.e*. before elemental creation, it was ‘uncognised,’
unknown; ‘this whole existed in the fluid state,’ *i.e*. every active or
mobile object was motionless; the ‘gross,’ the larger, ‘was contained in
the subtile,’ the smaller; *i.e*. every differentiated object was
resolved into its original evolvents; this indicates the
undifferentiated state of the world; and the last foot of the Mantra
describes the earliest stage of evolution; that ‘one entity’ which
‘existed’ ‘came to be born, by virtue of austerities,’ *i.e*. by the
force of austerity it became manifested in differentiated forms; *i.e*.
under the influence of past acts, it came into existence again; or, it
may mean that under the conditions described, Hiraṇyagarbha, came into
existence by himself, by virtue of his austerities; as described later
on (verso 6)—‘Thereupon the self-born &c. &c.’

The possibility of Universal Dissolution is proved by Inference: That
which has been found to bo destroyed in one part is also found to be
destroyed in its entirety; *e.g*. at one time a single house is found to
be burnt, and at another time the entire village is burnt (this is the
Major Premise); all such things as are produced by active agents,—such
for instance, as houses, palaces and the like are found to be liable to
destruction (this is the second step in the inferential process);—this
world, consisting of rivers, oceans, mountains &c., is the work of an
active agent (this is the third step);—hence it follows that, like the
house &c., the whole world will come to destruction (this is the final
conclusion). It will not be right to argue that the fact of the world
being the work of an active agent is itself not yet established;—for
that fact also is deduced from the fact of the world having, like the
house and such things, a particular shape;—all this constitutes the
Inference (upon which the statements in the present verse are based).

We do not make any attempt either at clarifying (discussing and
strengthening) the said proofs, or at refuting (the counter-arguments);
because the present treatise does not deal with proofs and reasonings;
and reasonings could not be fully grasped until they have been fully
stated and examined; and if all this were done, the work would become a
treatise on ‘Reasonings,’ not on ‘Law;’ and further, it would become too
prolix.

This subject (of Creation and Dissolution) in its details shall be found
described (in verses 7 *et seq*.) and the process described shall be in
some places in accordance with the Purāṇas and sometimes in accordance
with the *Sāṅkhya* doctrines. But the knowing or not knowing of those
details does not make any difference in *Right* and *Wrong*; hence we
are not going to deal with it in detail. If any person stands in need of
the detailed account of the process, be should search for it in the said
sources of information. What we undertake to do is to construe and
explain the words of the text, and this is all that we shall do. A brief
exposition of the purport of the Discourse we have already given.

‘*This*,’ world, ‘*was in exitence*,’ ‘*in the form of dense
Darkness*’—*i.e*. as if it were dense darkness; the term ‘which has
several meanings, is here used to denote *similarity*; just as in the
statement ‘*yat tad bhinneṣvabhinnam chinneṣvachinnam sāmānyabhūtam sa
śabdaḥ*’ (‘that which remains the same even though the things denoted by
it are diverse; which remains undestroyed even when the things denoted
are destroyed, *which is, as if it were, a Generality*, this is the
Word’), the word ‘*samānyābhūtaḥ*’ means ‘as if it were a generality.’
“What is it that constitutes the similarity of the World to Darkness?”

The answer is given by the next word ‘*unperceived*;’ in as much as all
the products with their diverse differentiated forms are at the time
resolved in the Evolvent Original, the world is *not p* *erceived*.

It might have been cognised by means of Inference; but that also is not
possible; as it is ‘*undifferentiated*’; the ‘differential’ meant is
that character which distinguishes one thing from another; and this also
is dissolved at the time; for the simple reason that all products, with
their distinguishing features, have been destroyed.

‘*Incogitable*’—that form in which the World existed was not capable of
being even thought of, in that form; ‘cogitation’ here stands, for all
forms of Inference; the meaning being that at the time there was no kind
of Inference—neither from generals to particulars, nor from particulars
to generals—available, by means of which the World could be
cognised.—For these reasons it was also ‘*incognizable*.’

From all this it might follow that the World did not exist at all, and
it was only a non-existent World that came into existence
(subsequently); with a view to preclude this, the text adds—‘*as if
wholly merged in deep sleep*.’ As a matter of fact, the *existent* can
never come into existence out of the *non-existent*; it has been
declared in the Upanisads (the *Chāndogya*)—‘O dear one, this was, in
the beginning existent; how could the existent be born out of the
non-existent?’—All that is meant is that the World is incognizable by
the instrumentality of the ordinary means of cognition, which operate
through, and bear upon, only differentiated things; that such is its
condition is known from the scriptures, which also are as transcendental
in their character as the ante-natal condition of the World.

‘*As if merged in deep sleep*,’—‘deep sleep’ stands for that condition
of repose which is beyond the conditions of waking and dreaming; and it
has been cited only by way of illustration; the meaning being—‘just as
the soul, in the condition of deep sleep, remains entirely unconscious
of any thoughts or sufferings, and free from all notions of
diversity,—and yet it cannot be said to be non-existent, because on
waking, it is recognised as being the same that was asleep, as shown by
the idea *I have slept soundly*,—exactly the same is the case with the
World, as is shown by the scriptures that describe things as they have
actually existed, and also proved, for those who depend upon reasonings,
by what appear to be sound Inferences.’

‘*Was in existence*’—the past tense has been used, because the condition
described can never be known by any person; hence it is that it has been
described as ‘incognizable.’

‘*Wholly*’—this shows that the dissolution is not *partial* but *total*.

‘*Tamas*’ is generally taken here in the sense of the ‘Root evolvent’,
only Rāghavānanda taking it in the sense of the Vedantic *māyā*; he is
supported by Sāyaṇa who explains the term similarly, under his
explanation of Ṛgveda 18. 129. 8.

P. 8, l. 8—(1) *tam āsīt* (Ṛgveda 10.129.8)—Sāyaṇa supplies a somewhat
different explanation:

&gt; इदं जगत् सलिलं कारणेन सातम् अविभागापन्नम् भाः आसीत् । अथवा सलिलमिव, यथा क्षीरेण विभागापन्नं नीरस ज्ञायते तथा तमसा ऽविभागापन्नं जगत् न ज्ञायते । आ समन्तात् भवतीति 'आभु'। 'तपसः' स्रष्टव्य-पर्यालोचमरूपस्य ।

After the above described Great Night;—the ‘*Self-born*,’ he who comes
into existence by himself; *i.e*. who takes up a body by his own will,
his taking the body not being dependent upon his past acts, as it is in
the case of beings undergoing births and deaths.

‘*Unmanifest*,’—not cognizable by people devoid of ability to
contemplate and other powers produced by the practice of *yoga*. Or, it
would be better to read ‘*avyakṭam*’ (in the Accusative), making it an
epithet of ‘*idam*,’ ‘this;’ the meaning being ‘this universe which was
in its unmanifest condition.’

‘*Bringing into view*’—making it perceptible in the form of the grosser
products; that is, he by whose wish the World comes into existence.

‘*Appeared*’—the term ‘*Prāduḥ* (?)’—denotes *visibility*.

‘*Dispelling darkness*,’—‘darkness’ stands for the state of dissolution;
he dispells, sets aside, that state; he creates the World afresh and is
therefore said to ‘dispel darkness.’

‘*Elemental Substances*,’ earth and the rest.

‘*Other things*’—refers to Sound and other qualities of the said
substances;—he has his ‘power’ *i.e*. creative power—‘operating,’
acting, upon the said substances &c. The Elemental Substances by
themselves are incapable of producing the World; when however the
requisite potency is instilled into them by him, they become transformed
into the shape of trees and other things. The term ‘Elemental
Substances’ here does not stand for the substances, which at the
beginning of ‘creation,’ exist in the form of potencies lying latent in
Primordial Matter.

Another reading is ‘*mahābhūtānuvṛttaujāḥ*;’ ‘*anuvṛttam*, meaning *bent
upon*; the meaning of the epithet remains the same as before. (6)

‘*Mahābhūtādī*’—Here again Rāghavānanda, the Vedantin, is at variance
with the other commentators, and takes it in the sense of ‘*Akaṅkāra*,’
and not in that of ‘the Elemental Substances &c,’

‘*Prādurāsīt*’—‘assumed a body of his own free will, not in consequence
of his *Karma?*: (Medhātithi, Kullūka, Govinda, Nandana);—‘became
discernible’: (Nārāyaṇa)—‘became ready to create’: (Rāghavānanda)

The reader should refer to the latter portion of the *Bhāṣya* on verse
11, where the present verse is explained as setting forth the
self-evolution of *Prakṛti*, according to the *Sāṅkhya*.

This is reflected in the origin mythology developed in RV 10.129 (nAsadiya sUktaM), one of the most profound mantras in Hindu literature. All these origin mythology hymns appear in the 10th maNDala of the Rg veda and appear to be part of one of the youngest layers of the RV saMhita that may be associated with the kuru-pa~nchAla realm. 

## National myth
The term puruSha, that was coined in the kuru-pa~nchAla period, bears the same relationship with respect to the word pUru as mAnuSha does to manu.+++(4)+++ As the king pUru was the founding patriarch of the kuru-pa~nchAla ruling class, it is quite likely, that the renaming of the primordial being as puruSha was a move to ‘nationalize’ the ancient Indo-European origin mythology after their dynastic founder. The emphasis of these specific motifs in the MDS suggests that its precursor from the Indo-Iranian period, probably underwent a formalization in the kuru-pa~nchAla realm where it was expanded to include the prevalent origin mythologies and emerged as the principal corpus of Aryan law. This view is strongly supported by the geographical description given in MDS 2.19-2.23 that clearly views the kuru-pa~nchAla realm as the heartland of the Aryans who had settled in India:

These are the names of the various regions.

‘*Kurukṣetra*’ is what is known as *Samantapañcaka*, the place where the
Kurus were exterminated. The etymological signification of the name
‘*Kurukṣetra* h as been explained as meaning—‘do good deeds here, and
salvation shall come quickly,’ ‘*kuru sukṛtamatra kṣiprantrāṇam
bhavati*.’

‘*Matsyas*’ and the rest are the names of countries, in the plural form.

‘*Brahmarṣideśa*’ is the name of the entire group. *Brahmāvarta* is the
country ‘created by the Gods’; and since the *Brahmarṣis* are a little
lower in degree than the Gods, this country, being related to
*Brahmarṣis*, is slightly lower in grade than *Brahmāvarta*. This is
what is meant by this being ‘*next to Brahmāvarta*,’—*i.e*., slightly
different from it;—the negative particle (in ‘*a* denoting *slightly*;
just as when it is said that ‘the sick person should drink gruel when it
is *not-hot*,’ it is meant that it should be drunk when it is *slightly
hot*. The term ‘*antara*’ means *different*; as it is found in such
assertions as ‘*mahadantaram*,’ ‘in the case of men, women and water,
even a slight difference makes a great difference.’ (19)

Buhler curiously translates ‘*pratyak*’ by ‘east,’ while it means

The country that lies between the two limits of the Eastern and Western
Oceans,—and between the two mountains spoken of in the preceding
verse,—*i.e*., the Himālaya and the Vindhya,—is described as
‘*Āryāvarta*,’ ‘*by the learned*,’—*i.e*., by cultured people. It is
called ‘*Āryāvarta*’ in the sense that the *Āryas line there* (‘*Āryāḥ
vartante tatra*’); *i.e*., it is they that are born there again and
again, and the Barbarians, even though attacking it repeatedly, do not
remain there.

The particle ‘*āṅ*’ (in ‘*āsamudrāt*’) indicates the *outer* not the
*inner* boundary, and it does not indicate *inclusion*. Hence the
islands in the oceans do not come under ‘*Āryāvarta*.’

What are mentioned here are the four boundaries of the country: the
Eastern Ocean on the east, the Western Ocean on the west, the Hiṁālaya
on the north and the Vindhya on the south.

In as much as these two mountains have been mentioned as ‘boundaries,’
they are not included under ‘*Āryāvarta*’; from this people might be led
to conclude that one should not inhabit these mountains. And with a view
to (avoiding) this possibility, the Author adds the next verse.—(22)

Where the deer known as ‘*Kṛṣṇasāra*’—that which is either black with
white spots, or black with yellow spots—‘*roams*,’—lives—*i.e*., is
found, born, —‘*by nature*,’—*i.e*., not that where it resides for a
time only, having been imported as a present of rare value, and so
forth;—‘*that country is to be known*’—regarded—‘as *yajñīya*’—‘*fit for
sacrificial acts*.’

‘*Beyond that*’—*i.e*., the region other than the one where the
*Kṛṣṇasāra* is indigenous—‘*is the land of the Mlecchas*.’ The
*Mlecchas* are the people who are known as lying beyond the pale of the
four castes,—not included even among the *Pratiloma* castes; such as the
*Medas*, the *Andhras*, the *Śabaras* and the *Pulindas*.

It is not meant that the sacrifices are to be performed on the very spot
where the deer roams,—in the way in which they are performed ‘on level
ground,’ according to the injunction that ‘one should perform sacrifices
on level ground’; as we h ave ‘rooms’ in the present tense, and
certainly one could not perform a sacrifice on the very spot, and at the
very time, at which the deer may have started to roam. Further, a
certain place is the ‘locus’ of the sacrifice only in the sense that it
holds a all those things that are operative towards its performance,
either as instruments or agents and the like, and certainly two material
substances (*i.e*., the Roaming Deer and the Sacrificial Accessories)
could never occupy the same spot. Nor can the condition mentioned (the
roaming of the deer) be taken as indirectly indicating some, other time
(than the one at which the *roaming* is being done); as no such indirect
indication is admissible in the case of Injunctions; as has been shown
under the *Adhikaraṇa* dealing with the ‘winnowing basket’
(*Mīmāmsā-Sūtra*, 1.2.26 *el. Seq*.), by Śabara (on 1.2.26), who
says—‘what is meant by *is done* is that *it is capable of being done*’
\[and the *present time* is not what is meant to be emphasised\].

“As a matter of fact, when one thing is spoken of as *located*
(contained) in another, it does not mean that it occupies the whole of
it; so that it is not necessary for the *Locus* to be occupied in its
entirety, as it is in the case of the oil contained in the
seasamum-seed. In fact, even when only a portion of one tiling is
occupied by another, the whole of the former becomes its *locus* or
*container; e.g*. when a man is spoken of as ‘sitting *in the house*,’
or ‘occupying the chariot.’ So that in the case in question what is
described here is the entire country, consisting of villages and towns,
and bounded by hills and rivers; and when the deer roams even in some
part of it, the whole country becomes its *locus*. Hence there is no
force in the argument that ‘two material substances cannot occupy the
same spot.’”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—In the present instance there is
no direct injunction, such as ‘one should perform sacrifices here (in
this country)’; as the injunctive affix is found added to the root ‘to
know’ (in the word ‘*jñeyaḥ*’), and not to the root ‘to sacrifice.’ All
that is meant is that the country spoken of is ‘fit for sacrifices’; the
meaning being that ‘this country is fit for sacrificial performances’;
and this ‘fitness for sacrifices’ is possible even without a direct
injunction (of the actual performance). The fact of the matter is that
it is only in the countries mentioned that the several sacrificial
accessories, in the shape of the *kuśa* -grass, the *Palāśa*, the
*Khadira* and other trees, are mostly found; and sacrificial performers
also, in the shape of persons belonging to the three higher castes and
learned in the three Vedas, are found only in these countries; and it is
on the basis of these facts that the countries have been described as
‘fit for sacrifices.’ The verb ‘*jñeyah*’ ending in the verbal affix
(‘*yat*’) also has the sense of the injunctive only imposed upon it, and
in reality it is only an *Arthavāda* resembling an injunction; just like
the passage ‘*jartilayavāgvā vā juhuyāt*,’ (‘one should offer either the
wild seasamum or the wild wheat’) \[which, even though cotaining the
injunctive word ‘*juhuyāt*,’ has been regarded as an *Arthavāda*
resembling an injunction\],

When again it is said that ‘*beyond this is the land the mlecchas*,’
this also is purely descriptive of the usual state of things; the sense
being that in these other lands it is mostly *mlecchas* that are born;
it does not mean that people inhabiting them are all (on that account)
‘*mlecchas*’; because what is a ‘*mleccha*’ is well known, just like the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ and other well known castes. In fact, the name
‘*mlecchadeśa*’ is to be taken literally, in the sense that it is ‘the
country of mlecchas’; so that if mlecchas happen to conquer a part of
Āryāvarta itself and take their habitation there, that also would become
‘*mlecchadeśa*.’ Similarly if a certain well-behaved king of the
Kṣatriya-caste should happen to defeat the *mlecchas* and make that land
inhabited by people of the four castes, relegating the indigenous,
*mlecchas* to the category of ‘*Chāṇḍāla*,’ as they are in *Āryāvarta*,
then that which was a ‘country of the mlecchas’ would become a ‘land fit
for sacrifices.’ And this for the simple reason that no laud is by
itself defective; it is only by association that it becomes defective,
just as it is when soiled by impure things. Hence, even apart from the
countries designated here as ‘fit for sacrifices,’ if, in a certain
place, all the necessary conditions are available, one should perform
his sacrifices, even though it be a place where the spotted deer does
not roam.

From all this it follows that the statement—‘*this should, be known as
the country fit for sacrifices, and beyond is the land of the mlecchas*’
is purely descriptive, being meant to be supplementary to the injunction
that follows in the next verse.—(23).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Kṛṣṇaṣāraḥ*—Burnell—“What animal is intended it is impossible to say.
In Southern India, a pretty little, but rare, gazelle is taken for it.
It does not however answer to the name so far as its colour (light
brown) goes.”

From the explanation given by Medhātithi the deer meant is that which is
‘black with white spots’, or ‘black with yellow spots’; and there is no
doubt that the animal meant is that which is black in the upper, and
white (or yellow) in the lower parts of its body.

*Medhātithi* (p. 76, 1. 26)—‘*Śūrpādhikaraṇe*’—in Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 1-2-26;
and the next sentence ‘*etaddhi kriyate ityucyate*’ is from Śabara on
that Sūtra,—the whole sentence being—‘*etat* (*i. e. shakyate
kartumiti*) *hi kriyate ityucyate, na ca vartamānakālaḥ kaschidasti
yasyāyam pratinirdeṣhaḥ*.’

‘*Mleccadeśastvataḥparaḥ*’—Note the liberalised interpretation of this
provided by Medhātithi. Burnell curiously enough regards this to be an
‘order to dwell in this land’. There is no ‘order’ to dwell in the
Mleccadeśa. The countries to be inhabited having been defined and all
beyond these being designated as ‘Mlechadeśa’, the term ‘these
countries’ of verse 24 refers, as Medhātithi clearly points out, to
Brahmāvarta, Madhyadeśa, Brahmarṣideśa and Yajñīyadeśa; and the order to
dwell contained in verse 24 also refers to those, and not to the
‘Mlecchadeśa’, which is ‘beyond these.’

This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 18), which
adds that the country described as ‘fit for sacrificial performances’ is
meant to be so used only when the aforesaid four countries are not
available;—in the *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā,p. 56), which explains
‘*Yājñiyaḥ*’ as ‘fit for sacrificial performances’, and ‘*Mlecca*’ as
‘unfit *for sacrificial* performances’;—and in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
4).

## Epoch deduction
Specifically the clans of primary protagonists of the pUru epic, the mahAbhArata, the kurus, the yadus, the pa~nchAlas and the matsyas are mentioned as being present in the core Aryan region. However, in the MDS the principle references to kshatriyas, are to those such as sudAs paijavAna, gAthi, nahusha and vena, who were exalted in the vedic texts, and the brAhmaNas that followed them. Similarly, there is reference to bRbhu, the paNI chieftain and his patronage of the vedic seer bharadvAja, that is alluded to principally in the Rgveda. The mention of these figures, rather than the mahAbhArata heroes or the IkshvAkus, or the Magadhan rulers, suggests that the basic core of the MDS was laid out just prior to the great bhArata war period.

## Kingly description

The descriptions of the Aryan king in the MDS are quite close to the primary Indo-European ruler figure and represents monarchy in a state of anterior to that seen in later Hindu texts like the artha shAstra and the panchatantra.  The king in the MDS is repeatedly described as embodying the deities, indra, vAyu, agni, varuNa, yama, kubera, chandra and surya (MDS 5.58, 7.04, 7.07). For example:

<div class="js_include" url="/kalpAntaram/smRtiH/manuH/vishvAsa-prastutiH/07/004_indrAnila-yamArkANAm_agnesh.md"  newLevelForH1="5" includeTitle="false"> </div>  

<div class="js_include" url="/kalpAntaram/smRtiH/manuH/sarvASh_TIkAH/07/004_indrAnila-yamArkANAm_agnesh.md"  newLevelForH1="5" includeTitle="false"> </div>  




In this respect the differs from the later description of the king as an embodiment of viShNu and come closer to the Rgvedic model where great heroes like the IkshvAku monarch, trasadasyu’s regal power is compared to that of indra and varuNa. The Rgveda also emphasizes the nature of agni, varuNa and yama as divine ‘kshatriyas’- their qualities were easily superimposed on the earthly ruler. The king was conceived as an individual concentrating extraordinary qualities: He was supposed to be learned in various texts of statecraft, vedic texts, lore of business and trade and the texts of debating (MDS 7.43).  The king is also called upon to maintain humility, despite his absolute power (MDS 7.40-42). He is also asked to abstain from excesses of alcohol, chess, women and hunting and desist from inflict harm on his people (MDS 7.50-51).



The king of the MDS was along with his brahminical elite was principally concerned with legal issues- the brahmins served as interpreters of the law, prosecutors and the like, while the king served as the ultimate judge and law enforcer, as yama and varuNa in the divine sphere. 

All other aspects of the state were not directly under the king but relegated to a panel of 7-8 sachivas (ministers). These sachivas were supposed to be experts handling of issues like revenues, budgets, mines, store houses and directly report to the king (MDS 7.54). There were two other specialized posts: 

1) the dutaH- who handled foreign affairs and espionage and also served as an ambassador and 
2) the amAtya- who was in charge of all internal and external security issues (MDS 7.63-68).  
   

## Fort warfare
The king is repeatedly advised to construct fortified strongholds, especially hill forts with ramparts protected by archers and make such structures the seat of his power. This clearly appears to be in line with the old Aryan concept of fort warfare and the titles of victorious Aryan rulers like breaker of hostile forts. 

## vyUhas
In terms of warfare clearly the concept of the vyuha or specific battlefield formations dominates. Many of the vyuhas mentioned in the mahabhArata figure in the MDS (MDS 7. 187-189). The vyuhas are also reminiscent of the battle formations alluded to in the Mongol texts were troops were arrayed in particular configuration to allow certain kinds of maneuvers. The king while always participating in battle left actual military preparations to the senApati (commander-in-chief) and balAdhyakshas (generals). Interestingly the MDS insists that the core force should only be made up of men of kuru, pa~nchAla, matsya or yAdava affiliation- again reinforcing the observation that the MDS is essentially a kuru-pancAla text.+++(4)+++


## Production
These observations taken together suggest that the brahminical priests produced the text at the behest of their kuru patrons, during the pinnacle of their reign in northern India (circa 1500-1400 BC). The first round of redactions probably occurred very shortly thereafter, during the period of peace and prosperity in the reign of the kuru-pa~nchAla monarchs parIkshita and janamejaya (~1300 BC). This period saw a large-scale systematization of a variety of circum-vedic texts and it is very likely that basic form of the MDS we inherit today was laid out in this phase.  Thus, the MDS being one of the principal dharma texts of the smArtas, is not surprising given the central role of the kuru-pa~nchAla empire’s in the emergence of Indian national consciousness.
