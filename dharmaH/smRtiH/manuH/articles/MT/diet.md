The MDS, like most other Indo-Aryan cosmogonies envisages all living organisms as emerging from a common ancestor, the prajApati, through several cycles of vertical descent. The MDS notices some kind of hierarchy within which these organisms with a clear suggestion of the division of life into several classes, each containing related life forms (MDS 42-49):

‘*That kind of action which belongs to the several beings*,’—*i.e*.,
hurtful or harmless—‘*has been already described*’;—now ‘*I am going to
explain the manner of their birth*.’

*Objection*.—

&gt; “Where has the *action* been described? In Verses 37 *et seq*. what
&gt; occurs is only the mention of the names of several beings, *Yakṣa,
&gt; Rākṣasa* and the rest; and their action is not mentioned at all.”

Our answer is as follows:—The action of each being is indicated by its
name; the particular name being acquired by each being by reason of its
actions: for instance, the *Yakṣas* are so called because of the act of
*worshpping*, or *pervading* (‘*Yakṣaṇa*’);—the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ are so
called because of the act of *destroying in secret* (‘*rahasi
kṣaṇana*’);—the *Piśāchas* are so called because of the act of devouring
flesh (‘*piśitāśana*’);—the *Apsarases* are so called because of the act
of *issuing forth from water* (*adbhyaḥ ṣṛtāḥ*);— the *Asuras* are so
called because of the act of *not obtaining surā*, in the form of
nectar; and so on, the significance of the other names may be traced.

‘*The manner of their birth*’—*i.e*., they are *viviparous, oviparous*
and the like; going to be described in the following verses.—(42)

These are ‘*viviparous*,’ ‘born from the *Jarāyu*’; *Jarāyu* is the
womb, the place where the fœtus lies; it is in the womb that these
beings are conceived first, and it is only when they are emitted from
the womb that they become *born*; this is the manner of the birth of
these beings.

The term ‘*dat*’ is synonymous with ‘*danta*,’ and is totally different
from it; hence it is that we have the nominative plural form
‘*ubhayatodataḥ*’ (‘with two rows of teeth’).—(43)

All those immovable brings that are produced by splitting (i.e., Plants) grow out of seeds and slips. those that, abounding in flowers, perish with the ripening of their fruit, are called ‘oṣadhis’ (‘Annuals’).—(46)

‘*Udbhid*’ stands for ‘*udbhedana*,’ *the act of splitting*; the
‘*kvip*’ affix having a nominal force;—‘*those that are* *duced by
splitting* are ‘*udbhijja*’; they are so called because they come into
existence by *splitting* the seed and *breaking through* the soil; and
these are *plants; all* these plants ‘*grown out of seeds and slips*’
and become fixed in their places by means of roots and trunks and other
such things.

‘*Oṣadhyaḥ*’—the right form is ‘*oṣadhayaḥ*’ (because the base ends in
short *i*). Or we may take the word as a form of the base with the long
*ī*; this lengthening of the vowel being explained, either as according
to the *Vārtika* on Pāṇini 4.1.45, or as a Vedic anomily.

The natural characteristic feature of these *oṣadhis*—*i.e*., Annuals—is
as follows: ‘*They with the ripening of their fruit*’;—*i.e*, the
ripening of the fruit constitutes their *end* or *perishing*; as a
matter of fact, the paddy and other such plants perish as soon as their
fruit has ripened. They also abound in, are endowed with, many fruits
and flowers.

What is stated in this verse is the distinguishing characteristic of
*oṣadhis* (Annual plants), and what follows in the following verse,
constitutes the distinguishing feature of *Vṛkṣas* (Perennial Trees);
the characters mentioned being attributed to them in accordance with
actual facts.—(40)

\[The ordinary meaning of the verse is as follows\]—Those trees, in whom
fruits are produced without flowers, are called ‘*Vanasputi*,’ not
‘*Vṛkṣa*’; while those that bear flowers as well as fruits are, by
reason of the presence of both, called ‘*Vṛkṣa*’ As a matter of fact,
however, *Vanaspatis* are also called ‘*Vṛkṣa*,’ and *Vṛkṣas* are spoken
of as ‘*Vanaspati*.’ The particular grounds of such usage will have to
be shown later on.

What we hold however (as to the real meaning of this verse), is as
follows:—The present work does not make it its business to lay down the
meanings of words, in the manner of grammatical works; so that the
meaning of the verse cannot be that ‘those that have such and such a
character are denoted by the word *Vanaspati*, and so forth.’ In fact
what is described here is the manner of the birth of fruits; this
(*manner of birth*) having been put forward (in Verse 42) as the subject
ih hand. The meaning thus is as follows:—Fruits are produced in two
ways: they are produced without flowers, and also from flowers; and
flowers are produced from trees (called *Vṛkṣa*). Thus then, it follows
that, even though the statement is apparently in the form 'those that
bear fruits without flowers are to be known as *Vanaspati*,’—yet in view
of what forms the subject-matter of the context, the ‘*yat*’ (‘which’)
and ‘*tat*’ (‘that’) should be made to change their places; the
construction being—‘those trees that are known by the name *Vanaspati*
have no flowers, and yet they bear fruits’;—*i.e*., in these trees
fruits grow without flowers; this construction is adopted on the
strength of actual facts. Such altering of the construction on the
strength of facts we also find in such cases as the following Though the
actual words are in the form ‘*vāsasā pariveṣṭayeṭ*,’ ‘the post should
bo surrounded with cloth,’—yet in as much as the cloth has got to be
worn by the man, the words are constructed as ‘*stambhe nidhāya vāsaḥ
paridhāpayet*’ ‘the cloth should be hung on the post and then made to be
worn.’

Though what is stated in the present verse is a well known fact (and as
such did not need to be mentioned in the *Smṛti*), yet it has been
mentioned with the purpose of serving as an introduction to what is
going to be stated below in Verse 49—‘*Enveloped in darkness*, &c.
&c.’—(47)

‘*Clumps and Thickets*’—is the name given to the cluster of those shoots

‘*guccha*’ ‘Clump’ and ‘*gulma*’ ‘thicket’ may be taken as two different
things; the difference between the two being that, while one bears
flowers, the other is flowerless.—Other ‘*species of grass*—*e. g.,
kuśa, śādbala, śaṅkhapuṣpī* and so forth.—*Lowspreading tendrils*—the
long shoots of grass spreading on the ground.—‘*Creepers*’—are those

Burnell represents Medhātithi to explain ‘*guccha-gulma*’ as ‘one root
and many roots’. This is not fair. What Medhātithi says is that the
names ‘*guccha-gulma*’ are applied to clusters of short-growing creepers
which may have one root or several roots.’ Kullūka defines ‘*guccha*’ as
the single shoot springing from the root and having no boughs, and
‘*gulma*’ as a clump of shoots coming up from one root According to
Medhātithi the difference between the two consists in the fact that
while the former has flowers, the latter has none.

They are ‘*invested*,’ pervaded over, by that ‘Darkness’ (Inertia) of
which the cause is ‘*action*,’ in the form of *vice*;—‘*manifold*,’
being the cause of the experiencing of various kinds of pain. As a
matter of fact, all things are made up of three Constituent Attributes;
so what is meant is that in the beings here described the Attribute of
‘Darkness’ is in excess, and those of ‘Harmony’ and ‘Energy’ are present
in less degrees; hence as abounding in ‘Darkness’ (Inertia), and beset
with pain and humiliation, they continue, for a long time, to experience
the results of their vicious acts.

In as much as the Attribute of ‘Goodness’ (Harmony) also is present in
them, they do enjoy, in certain conditions, small measures of pleasure
also; it is in view of this that they are described as ‘*affected by
pleasure and pain*.’

‘*Possessing inner consciousness*,’—the term ‘*saṃjñā*’ stands for
*Buddhi*, Intelligence (Consciousness); and in as much as activity in
the form of going out, speaking and the like,—which are the effects
indicative of the presence of consciousness,—is absent (in Trees), they
are described as ‘*possessing inner consciousness*.’ This must be the
meaning of the epithet ‘*inner*’; as otherwise, since every person
exercises consciousness only *within* himself \[there would be no point
in the epithet at all\]. Or, the meaning may be that plants are unable
to have any cognisance of the prickings of thorns and other small
things, to the extent that human beings are; in fact for the
experiencing of pain they stand in need of such massive strokes as
*cutting with the axe* and the like;—being, in this respect, like
animate beings in the state of sleep, intoxication or swoon. \[Which
shows that plants have their consciousness lying far deeper within than
in animals.\]—(49)

An important aspect of the MDS is the acceptance of a commonality between diverse life forms animals, plants and others alike. 

Secondly it recognizes a basic similarity in their ability to response to experience various sensations. This unity of all life forms as expounded by the MDS makes itself visible in the taboos regarding meat-eating and expiation of sins for destruction of life forms. 

Explicitly, the killing of an animal by a brahmin solely for the purpose of eating meat is strongly banned by the MDS and violent death is said to be the divine retribution for such acts (MDS 5.37-38).  
Meat from a slaughterhouse, meat of birds, pigs, garlic, onion and leeks are completely banned for a brahmin (MDS 5.11, 5.12, 5.19).  
However, the brahmin may eat the meat of certain animal offered to the gods in sacrifices and whose meat is consecrated in the rites.  
These include the fishes like pathina, rohita,  
mammals like cows, horses, rhinos, porcupines, anteaters and hare,  
and others like monitors and tortoises. 

The MDS adds in a somewhat emphatically that the eating of meat according to the above prescriptions, drinking of alcoholic beverages and enjoyment of sexual pleasures are not sins.  
However, it adds the caveat that abstention from excess brings great rewards nevertheless (MDS 5. 56).  
Thus in the MDS we see an entirely different setup from what we may observe with the more recent Hindus.
