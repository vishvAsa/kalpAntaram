The presence of atomic thought in the manu-smR^iti

One of the most profound philosophical achievements of the ancient Hindus was the development of the vaisheShika darshaNa or the theory of the particulate structure of all matter. While the principle text of the vaisheShikas is kaNAda’s work, there is clear evidence that the philosophy had a more ancient root in the speculative hymns of the vedic saMhitas (for example Atharva Veda [shaunaka shAkha] 12.1.26, and RV 10.72.6). It is interesting to note that along with the other vedic philosophical and origin-mythological constructs the MDS also presents a scheme for the particular construction of matter (MDS1.15-20):

The creation of the Elemental Principles is now described. What forms
the constituent factor of what, and in what manner, has been already
explained by implication.

‘*From out of himself*’—*i.e*., from out of Primordial Matter, which
forms his body, ‘*he brought forth Mind*.’ The creation of the Elemental
Principles is set forth here in the reverse order; the meaning thus is
that ‘*before the mind he brought up the Principle of Egoism, whose
function consists in self-consciousness*’; the consciousness of self,
appearing in the form of the notion of ‘I,’ is a function of the
Principle of Egoism; it is called *all-powerful* in the sense that it is
capable of accomplishing its work.—(14)

**(verse xiv-xv)**

The confusion regarding the account of the process of creation contained
in Manu is best exemplified by these two verses. The names of the
various evolutes have been so promiscuously used, that the commentators
have been led to have recourse to various forced interpretations, with a
view to bring the statement herein contained into line with their own
philosophical predilections. Medhātithi, Kullūka, Govinda and
Rāghavānanda take it as describing the three principles of the
Sāṅkhya—Mahat, Ahaṅkāra and Manas; but finding that the production of
Ahaṅkāra from Manas, or of Mahat (which is what they understand by the
term ‘*mahāntam ātmānam*’) is not in conformity with the Sāṅkhya
doctrine,—they assert that the three evolutes have been mentioned here
‘in the inverted order’. Even, so, how they can get over the statement
that ‘Ahaṅkāra’ was produced ‘from Manas’ (‘manasaḥ’) it is not easy to
see. Similarly, the ‘ātman’ from which Manas is described as being
produced, Medhātithi explains as the Sāṅkhya ‘Pradhāna’, and Kullūka as
the Vedantic¹ Supreme Soul’.

Buhler remarks that according to Medhātithi by the particle ‘*ca*’ ‘the
subtile elements alone are to he understood.’

This does not represent Medhātithi correctly; his words
being—‘*caśabdena viṣayāṃśca śabdasparśarūparasagandhān pṛthivyādīni
ca*’.

In order to escape from the above difficulties, Nandana has recourse to
another method of interpretation,—no less forced than the former. He
takes ‘*manas*’ as standing for Mahat, and ‘*mahāntam ātmānam*’ as the
Manas.

Not satisfied with all this, Nandana remarks that the two verses are not
meant to provide an accurate account of the precise order of creation;
all that is meant to be shown is that all things were produced out of
parts of the body of the Creator himself.

The said six principles of their own respective evolutes,—to these he
joined their subtile components, and thus created all beings.

The number ‘*six*,’ (mentioned in connection with the Principles) is
made up of the *five* ‘Rudimentary Substances,’ to be described later
on, and the ‘Principle of Egoism’ already described.

The ‘*own envolutes*’ of these Principles, are their respective
products; *i.e*., the elemental substances, which are the products of
the‘Rudimentary Substances,’ the Sense-organs which are the products of
the ‘Principle of Egoism.’ The Eaṛth and the other Elemental Substances
being present, like so many ‘bodies,’ he joined to them the ‘subtile
components’; *i.e*., the Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of
Egoism; that is, he placed them in their proper places, and thus
‘*created all beings*,’—Gods, men, animals, birds, trees and so forth.

The meaning is as follows:—The six subtile components are productive of
one portion of the entire world, the whole of which is evolved out of
them; that they are ‘subtile’ is proved by the fact of their being
‘rudimentary’ in their character;—these he ‘*combined*,’ *i.e*., brought
together, *with their own envolutes*,’ *i.e*., their respective
products; he produced the material substances and the organs (of
action), and through these, the entire material world; these latter
being indicated by the word ‘even.’

In place of ‘*mātrāsu*’ it is better to rend ‘*mātrābhiḥ*’.—(16)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Six elements*—The five Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of
Egoism.

Here also, and for reasons similar to the above, there is a difference
of opinion among commentators.

Nandana, and Rāghavānanda take the verse as describing the creation of
the *bodies* of things from the *body* of the Creator, and that of their
*souls* from His Soul.

The ‘six’, Rāghavānanda takes as standing for the six sense-organs, and
Nandana as for the six *tattvas*—

1.  Mahat,
2.  Ahaṅkāra,
3.  Manas,
4.  Subtile Elements,
5.  Organs, of Action
6.  and Organs of Sensation.

Medhātithi takes the verse simply as describing how the Creator created
all beings by combining ‘the subtile components of the said six
principles’ with ‘their own evolutes.’

Hopkins remarks that ‘*ātmamātrā*’ stands for ‘the *spiritual* atom as
opposed to the *elementary*,—not reflexive *elements of himself*.’

‘*Frame*’—body; the ‘*components*’ of it are those things that
constitute it; these are ‘*subtile*,’ the ‘*six*’ already described
(*viz*.,the five Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of Egoism),
which are called ‘*aviśeṣa*,’ the undifferentiated. —*Tāni
āśrayanti*—*i.e*., the organs and the elemental substances going to be
described ‘enter into’ the said components; which means that they are
evolved out of them; *i.e*., the evolution of the organs &c., has for
its substratum the six subtile components; this is what has been
described in the words ‘the five elemental substances are produced out
of the five Rudimentary Substances’ (*Sāṅkhya-Kārikā*, 22). Because they
enter into them, therefore the ‘frame of that,’ *i.e*., of Primordial
Matter,—has been described as ‘Body.’

*Manasviṇaḥ*, ‘*maṇīṣā*’ is *wisdom*; those possessed of wisdom are
‘*manasvins*,’ *i.e*., *the wise ones*.

\[The above explanation makes ‘*tainīmāni*,’ the organs and substances,
the nominative, and the ‘components’ the objective;—this construction is
found to be incompatible with the nominative ending in ‘*avayavāḥ*,’
‘*components*’; hence the *Bhāṣya* puts forward another construction,
which has been adopted in the rendering of the text.\]—Or, the relation
of the ‘nominative’ and ‘objective’ may be reversed: the ‘subtile
components’ being the nominative, and the ‘organs’ the objective (of the
verb ‘*āśrayanti*,’); the meaning of ‘*āśrayanti*,’ ‘enter into,’ being
that the subtile components serve as the *substratum*—‘*āśraya*’—of the
organs; just as in the phrase ‘he has been fed (upon) by many men,’ the
man doing the *feeding* is spoken of as ‘fed.’—Or, since verbal roots
may have several meanings, ‘*enter in*’ may be explained as
‘produce.’—(17)

Nandana explains the verse to mean that ‘the body of *Hiraṇyagarbha* is
called *Śarīra*, body, because it enters all things mentioned in the
preceding verses by means of its portions’; according to Medhātithi on
the other hand, it means that—the body of *Pradhāna* is called *Śarīra*,
because its six components enter into these things,—*viz*., the organs
and the elemental substances. Kullūka refers it to the body of Brahman.

The only important points of difference are—(1) while Medhātithi takes
it as referring to the body of Pradhāna, others take it as refering to
that of Hiraṇyagarbha or Brahmā; and (2) while according to Medhātithi
the evolutes entering into that Body are the organs and the gross
elemental subtances, according to Nandana, they are only the six
principles named in verses 14-15.

The natural construction of the verse appears to be *yat (yasmāt
kāraṇāṭ) sūr?yacayacāḥ sūkṣmāḥ tāni imāni ṣaṭ āśrayanti tasmāt*——as set
forth by Medhātithi But if *tāni imāni* refers to *indriyāṇi* then there
should be an accusative ending in in order to make it the object of
*āśrayanti*. It is in view of this difficulty that the Bhāṣya has put
forward *another* construction by which *sūkṣmāḥ* is the nominative and
*tānīmāni* the objective of the verb *āśrayanti*,

‘*That*,’ ‘Primordial Matter—is ‘the generator of all things’:—it is
‘*imperishable*,’ *i.e*., in its original (causal) form it is
indestructible.

“In what way does Primordial Matter *generate* all things?”

Because all these *enter into it*.

“What are *all these* that enter into it?”

First of all ‘*the Mind along with its subtile components*,’—*i.e*.,
along with the Rudimentary Substances, the Principle of Intelligence,
the Principle of Egoism and the Sense-organs;—and then, the *Great
Elemental Substances*—called ‘Earth,’ ‘Water,’ ‘Fire,’ ‘Wind,’ and
‘Ākāśa;’—‘*along with their functions*;—

1.  sustaining,
2.  conglutination,
3.  cooking,
4.  configuration
5.  and making room (unobstruction) respectively are the ‘functions’ of
    Earth, &c.

Of these

1.  ‘sustaining’ means upholding, keeping in their places, things that
    are prone to falling;
2.  ‘conglutination’ means bringing together things that are loose and
    disjointed; *e.g*., loose and disjointed dust-particles are brought
    togther, cemented into, a mass by means of water;—
3.  ‘Cooking’ is the well-known effect produced by fire upon such
    tilings as medicine and herbs, &c.
4.  ‘Configuration’ means conformation, shaping;—
5.  ‘making room’ means non-obstruction by another body; in a point in
    space where one body is already present, there can be no room for
    another body; *e.g*., no object can find room within a piece of
    gold.

‘*Mind*’—is meant to indicate all the organs of sensation; and the term
‘*Karma*’ may be taken as referring to the organs of action; or again,
in the first line of the text, the term ‘*Karma*’ may be taken to mean
the ‘products’ of the elementary substances; the sense of the passage
being that ‘subsequently the products of the elemental substances, along
with the subtile components, enter into the great elemental
substances’—‘as also do the organs of sensation,’ this latter being
indicated by the word ‘*Mind*.’—(18)

Buhler supplies the translation of the verse according to the five
interpretations offered by the commentators.

1.  The text here represents the explanation given by *Medhātithi*:—
2.  According to *Govinda* and Kullūka the verse means—‘From Brahman are
    produced the gross elements, together with their functions, and the
    Mind, which is the producer of all beings through its minute
    portions, and imperishable’.—
3.  According to *Rāghavānanda*—‘That gross body the gross elements
    enter, and the Mind, which is the producer of all beings and
    imperishable, together with the actions and with the limbs.’—
4.  According to *Nandana*—‘As that body of Hiraṇyagarbha, though
    through its small portions it produces all beings, ye tis
    imperishable,—even thus the Great Beings and the Mind, with the
    actions enter it.’—
5.  According to *Nārāyana*—‘That subtile body the gross elements enter,
    together with the *Karma* and the Mind, the producer of all beings
    and imperishable, together with its minute portions.’

Dr. Buhler’s rendering of this verse is not approved by Hopkins. The
construction of the sentence is the same in all cases—*mahānti bhūtāni
karmabhiḥ saha—manaśca sūkṣmaiḥ avayavaiḥ*.

Medhātithi himself offers a second explanation.

All that is meant by saying that ‘*the perishable proceeds from the
imperishable*’ is that the Gross is produced out of the Subtile; and it
is not meant to emphasise whether it is produced out of the particles of
*six* or *seven* Principles; in fact there are twenty-four Principles,
all of which form the cause of the origin of all things. Or, the meaning
may be that in the production of the gross oḥjeot only seven Principles
form the principal cause, *e.g*., the six non-differentiated Principles
(the live Rudimentary Substances and the principle of Egoism) and the
seventh, the Great Principle of Intelligence. Out of these (seven) are
produced the Elemental Substances and the Organs; and when these latter
have been produced, the gross body becomes formed.

\[It has been said that\] from out of the imperishable Primordial
Matter,—which in its unified form, contains within itself the
possibilities of all its evolutes,—is produced this world, which is
multifarious in its character and appears in all possible forms.

Now the question arises—Docs the Primordial Matter become modified into
all its gross evolutes at one and the same time? And the answer to this
is ‘No;’ what really happens is described in the present verse—‘*From
out of the subtile*, &c., &c.,’ The order in which the things are
produced is the same as that which has been described before: that is,
from out of Primordial Matter is produced the Great Principle of
Intelligence;—from this latter the Principle of Egoism; and from this
latter again the ‘group of sixteen’ (*kārikā*, 22).

The term ‘*Puruṣa*’ has been used in the sense of the *Principles*, on
the ground that these latter subserve the purposes of the *Puruṣa*
(Soul).

‘*Exceedingly potent*’—capable of producing their effects; it is because
they are the cause of innumerable products that they have been called
‘*exceedingly*.’

The said principles have certain ‘*subtile constituents of their
frames*’;—‘*mūrti*’ is *frame*; the constituents that go to form that
frame are called ‘*constituents of the frame*’; from out of these is
born ‘*this*’ (the gross Body). It is in reference to this that it is
added—‘*the perishable proceeding out of the imperishable*.’

*Question*—“What are the ‘*subtile* constituents’ of the said
Principles? Certainly the Rudimentary Substances have no other
‘constituents’ (save those that are *subtile*), in reference to (for the
exclusion of) which such specification could be possible (as that
intended by the epithet ‘subtile’).”

*Answer*—The qualification ‘subtile' is not in relation to the
constituents of any single Principle itself; what is meant is that (one
principle is ‘subtile’ in relation to, in comparison to, another,
*i.e*.) the Great Principle of Intelligence is subtile as compared to
the Rudimentary Substances, and the Root Evolvent (Primordial Matter) is
‘subtile’ as compared to the Great Principle.

\[Another explanation of the verse is given below, in the form of an
introduction to verse 20\].—19

The ‘seven’ are made up of—

\(1\) Egoism, the five subtile elements and the Mahat (Medhātithi,
Govinda and Kullūka);—(2) *Ātman* instead of *Mahat* (Nārāyana and
Nandana). Medhātithi notes another enumeration suggested by ‘others’—(1)
The five organs of Perception, (2) the five organs of Action and (3),
(4), (5), (6) and, (7) the five grogs elemental substances.’

The name ‘*puruṣa*’ has been applied to the Tattvas, Principles,—because
‘they serve the purposes of the, soul’ (Medhātithi),—or because ‘they
are produced by the Puruṣa, Ātman,’

Among these (Elementary Substances), each succeeding one acquires the quality of what precedes it; and each elemental substance is endowed with as many qualities as the place it occupies (in the order in which the said substances are set forth).—(20)


“Why does the Author use the form ‘ādyādyasya’? The correct form should be ‘ādyasyādyasya’, the repetition of the term ‘ādyasya’ being necessitated by Pāṇini’s Sūtra 8.1.4; just as we have in such expressions as ‘paraḥ paraḥ.’”

In the preceding verse some people offer a different explanation of the
number ‘seven’:—(1) The five *organs of sensation*, the Eye and the
rest, taken together from a single group; they are regarded as ‘one’ on
account of their possessing the common character of being *the
instruments of perception*;—(2) similarly the five *organs of action*;
these two, forming two groups, are ‘*two* principles’;—(3-7) the five
elemental substances, being treated individually, by reason of their
functions being distinct from one another, are the ‘*seven principles*’;
and the five Rudimentary Substances and the principle of Egoism are the
‘subtile constituents’ that go to make up the ‘bodies’ of the said
seven;—*i.e*., these seven are the products of evolution from the said
six.—The rest of the verse is explained in the same manner as set forth
above.

Thus, in accordance with this explanation, the Elemental Substances
having been spoken of in the preceding verse (19), the pronoun ‘*eṣām*,’
‘*among these*,’ refers to those same substances. Though there are
several words intervening (between the mention of Elemental Substances
in verse (19) and the pronoun ‘among *these*’ in the present verse),
which are in closer proximity to the pronoun, yet, as a matter of fact,
what Is described in the present verse,—the fact of ‘these’ being
endowed with a particular number of qualities derived from well-defined
sources—is applicable only to the Elementary Substances, and not to
other things; even though these latter may form the subject-matter of
the context (and may as such, be capable of being referred to by the
pronoun in question).

The meaning of the verse thus comes to this:—‘*Among these*’ Elemental
Substances,—which are set out (later on) in a definite order of
sequence, one preceding the other—the ‘succeeding one’ acquires the
quality of the preceding one, through its connection with it.—The term
‘*quality*’ here stands for the five, Sound and the rest;—the
‘*preceding*’ (and ‘succeeding’) is in reference to the order in which
the names of the Elemental Substances are set forth in verse 75 below,
where it is said that ‘first of all Ākāśa is produced &c., &c.’ The fact
of sound &c., being the qualities of these substances will also bo
described in that same verse.—Among Ākāśa and the rest, each one
occupies a definite place in the order in which they are set forth; the
term ‘*yāvatithaḥ*’ means *the number of the place occupied by it*; the
word being formed by the adding of the affix ‘*ithuk*,’ by Pāṇini’s
*Sūtra* 5.2.53. The meaning is that each substance becomes endowed with
as many qualities as the place, *second* or *third*, &c., occupied by
it; that is, the substance occupying the *second* place in the order of
sequence has *two* qualities, that occupying the *third* place has
*three*, and so on.

The first half of the verse means that among the Elemental Substances,
each succeeding one acquires the quality of its predecessor; and each of
them is later on (under verses 75 &c.) described has having one quality
inherent in itself; for instance, ‘Ākāśa is known as possessing the
quality of sound’ (verse 75); ‘Fire is described as possessing the
quality of colour’ (verse 77), and so forth; so that acquiring one
quality from its predecessor (and having one inherent in itself) each
substance would appear to be endowed with only two qualities,—with the
sole exception of Ākāśa (which, having no substance ‘preceding’ it,
would have the single quality of Sound, which is inherent in itself);
hence with a view to preclude such an idea, the author has added the the
second half of the verse—*Each Elemental Substance being endowed with as
many qualities &c. &c*.,—which means that Wind has *two* qualities, Fire
has *three*, Water has *four*, and Earth has *five*.

&gt; “Why does the Author use the form ‘*ādyādyasya*’? The correct form
&gt; should be ‘*ādyasyādyasya*’, the repetition of the term ‘*ādyasya*’
&gt; being necessitated by Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* 8.1.4; just as we have in such
&gt; expressions as ‘*paraḥ paraḥ*.’”

The form used is due to the exigencies of metre; and exigencies of metre
justify the non-observance of rules.—(20)

While this atomic origin mythology of the MDS may not reach the level of the well argued physical and chemical theories of matter presented in the sutras of kaNada the kAshyapa or the discourses of pa~nchashika the A~Ngirasa and sulabhA the vasiShTha, it does present some basic features of Hindu atomic thought. Importantly, it recognizes the presence of a unified origin of all existence with the structural lay out of the universe attributable to a small set of minute fundamental particles. Further, it recognizes that these particles combine to give rise to the changing universe while remaining more permanent themselves. It also presents the concept of a hierarchy of combination of the basic particles, with the current combination being influenced by the constituent ones. 


The occurrence of the atomistic doctrine with the other more macro-scale origin mythologies in the MDS suggests, that this was one of the streams of origin mythology that developed along with the others in the kuru-pa~nchala realm. Such concepts appear to have been the seeds of the vaisheShika philosophy, that developed parallel to old vedAnta and sAmkhya, which emerged from a different set of seed ideas in the same milieu.
