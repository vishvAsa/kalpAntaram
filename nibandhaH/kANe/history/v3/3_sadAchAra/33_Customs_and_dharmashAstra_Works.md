CHAPTER XXXIII 

CUSTOMS AND DHARMASASTRA WORKS 

It is now necessary to see how Dharmaśāstra works have dealt with the authority and binding force of customs and usages. Sadācāra is defined by Harita as follows 1657:- the word 'sat' means 'good' and the good are those who are free from (inoral) taint; the practices of such people are called sadācāra. Vide Manu II. 18, which also defines sadācāra. Even the most ancient sūtras testify to the fact that numerous customs and usages had arisen in different countries and vil lages. The Aśv. gr. (1. 7.1-2) says, 1658 various indeed are the observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should follow those in marriages; what, however, is common (to all or most ) shall be declared by us'. The Ap. gr. (II. 15) declares, * people should understand from women what procedure is to be observed (according to custom)' and the Ap. Dh. S. provides (1. 7. 20. 8 = II. 11. 29. 14 ) that one 1659 should regulate one's course of action ( in difficult or doubtful matters ) according to the conduct which is unanimously approved of in all countries by the Āryas (men of the three higher castes ), who have been properly disciplined, who are aged, who have restrained their senses and who are neither covetous nor hypocritical and con cludes with the aphorism (II. 11. 29. 15 ) 'some teachers hold that the rest of the dharmas (not set out in this work ) may be understood from women and from men of all castes'. Baud. Dh. S. 1660 (1. 5. 13) states (on the subject of śrāddha) 'the us. ages of people should be followed as to other rites to be per formed'. Several gļhyasūtras (like Pāraskara II. 17, Mānava

gr. I. 4.6) refer to the practices of people that should be followed in such matters as commencing agricultural operations, holi days &c. It is needless to set out these in detail here. Manu1661 IV, 178 pronounces the general prescription for all men, 'one should walk in the path of good men which their fathers and grandfathers trod; by so doing one will come to no harm'. For ordinary men this procedure is easy to understand and to follow. This dictum sets a premium on the attitude of no change in any matter for fear that change may lead to some unexpected harm and has been throughout the ages up to the present the inotto of most people in India. As ācara or sadācāra is tangible and requires no effort to decide between conflicting views, we find eulogies of it in the earliest smrtis and purāṇas. Vide Manu IV. 155-158, Vas. VI. 6-8 (the first and last of which are the same as Manu IV. 157-158), Anuśāsanaparva 104. 6-9, Vignu Dh. S. 71. 90-92 ( which are almost the same as Manu IV. 155, 156, 158), Mārkaṇdeya chap. 34, Brahmapurāṇa 121. 6-9, Viṣṇu purāṇa III. chapters 11-12, Kurniapurāṇa (uttarardha, chap.15). 

The general rule about the binding character of customs is set out as follows. Gaut. (XI. 20) obseryes, 1662 the dharmas (customs) of countries, castes and families, which are not upposed to the Vedic scriptures, are authoritative and binding'. Gaut, provides in the next two sūtras that cultivators, traders, herdsmen, money-lenders and artisans can lay down conven tions or usages that would be binding on the respective classes, that when a dispute arises as to these usages the king should learn affairs from those who wield authority over those clagses and decide the dispute accordingly. Vas. I. 17 states, 'Manu has declared that the (peculiar) customs of countries, castes and families may be followed in the absence of rules propounded by the Veda', and in XIX. 7 prescribes that the king should

enforce these among the four varṇas. Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15.1 appears to lay down that the customs of countries and families (if not opposed to Veda) are authoritative and are to be follow ed in the respective countries or families. But this view seems to be unacceptable to Baudh, Dh. S. (I. 1. 19-26) which says, 1663 thero is difference of opinion regarding five (practices) in the South as well as in the North. We shall explain those peculiar to the south. They are: to eat in the company of ( in the same plate with ) one whose upanayana is not performed, to eat in the company of one's wife, to partake of stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt. Now ( the customs peculiar) to the north are: to sell wool, to drink rum, to deal in the sale of animals with an upper and a lower row of teeth, to follow the profession of arms and to travel by sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they are generally in vogue commits sin, For, in respect of these customs the authoritativeness must be restricted to the respective countries. Gautama declares that this is false. And one should not approve of (accept) either ( of the two sets of practices), because they are opposed to the tradition of siṣtas (or opposed to the emptis and the views of śiṣṭas)'. The Tantravārtika 1664 (p. 211) mentions the argument of some con cerning these passages of Ap. and Baud, viz. that Apastamba's very general statement that practices of countries and families are authoritative in the respective countries cannot be accepted

as valid, as it is opposed to the views of Gaut. (XI. 20 ), as Baud. expressly states that certain practice, though prevalent in certain localities cannot be accepted as valid and binding even in those localities because they are opposed to the express words of such authoritative and highly yenerated smrtis (as those of Manu). Manu in several places provides for the enfor ceability of customs and usages. In Manu VII. 203 it is said, *the conqueror should hold as authoritative and binding the lawful customs of the conquered country, just as they are stated to be' and in Manu VIII. 41 and 461665 it is provided, 'A king who knows dharma ( sacred law) should carefully inquire into 

· the customs of castes, of countries, of guilds and of families 

and settle (or enforce) the customs peculiar to each. Whatever may have been practised by the good and by twice-born men 

devoted to dharma, that shall be established (by the king) as the law, provided it be not opposed to the ( customs of ) coun tries, families and castes'. Medhātithi adds that the king has to see wliether the customs of countries, families, castes and guilds are directly in conflict with the Veda or are harmful to others or utterly immoral (such as marrying one's mother) and only those that are found not to be 80 are to be enforced by the king and he 1666 adds on Manu II. 6 that the practices of sistas (persons who are well conducted, free from greed and learned in the Veda ) on matters on which the Veda and smrti are silent and which they observe with the consciousness that they (prac tices) are right (dharma) should be deemed to be based on Veda. He offers certain illustrations of such practices and also

It should be noted that in other works also the Pārasikas were credited with the highly immoral practice of marrying one's own mother.

relies 1667 upon the words of the Mahabharata (Vanaparva 313. 117), 'what is true dharma is concealed as in a dark cave; the (only) path is to follow great men'. In I. 118 Mann declares that the ancient (or long enduring ) laws (or customs) of countries, castes, families and the rules among heretics and companies (of traders and the like) have been dealt with by him in the gāstra ( Institutes ). Yāj, I. 343 provides that when a conqueror reduces a country to subjection he should preserve intact whatever customs, laws and judicial procedure, and family usages are handed down from generation to generation therein ( provided they are not opposed to sāstras and, as the Mit. says, he should not cause confusion by imposing the us ages of his own country on the conquered country). Yāj. II. 192 (like Manu and Gaut.) provides that the varying usages and conventions of śreṇis (guilds of artisans), naigamas (traders), heretics and associations (of soldiers and the like) should be respected by the king in the same way as he honours the usages of learned brāhmaṇas. About the latter Yāj. II. 186 says that the king should sedulously enforce the conventions of learned brāhmaṇas which are not opposed to the dictates of the Veda and smrti (such as about pastures, water-courses and wells and the preservation of temples) and he should also enforce his edicts that are not opposed to Veda and smrti (such as making pro vision for travellers and prohibiting the sale of horses to an enemy &c.). Kautilya prescribes 1668 that the king should follow as regards inheritance and partition the customs that are in vogue in a country, a caste, a sangha (company or guild) or a village. Devala 1669 and Bphatparāśara (X. p. 281) have a verse very similar to Yāj. I. 343. The Mahābhārata remarks that there is no custom or practico that can be said to be beneficial

to all alike 1670, ' From this it follows that variations in prac tices were to be tolerated by the king. Bphaspati 1671 advises the king to keep intact the customs of countries, castes and fāmilies that have been long in vogue in them and states that otherwige the subjects become irritated and disaffected and there is logs of wealth and army. He gives certain striking illus trations of peculiar practices: 'members of the twice-born classes in the southern countries take in marriage their mater nal uncle's daughter; in the middle country (the country between the Himalaya and the Vindhya lying to the west of Prayāga and to the east of Vinaśana where the Sarasvati dis appears, as said by Manu II. 21 ) artisans and menial workers eat the flesh of a cow; in the eastern countries people (all in cluding brāhmaṇas ) eat fish and women are given to adultery; in the north women drink liquor and contact with then even in their monthly illness is allowed; the people of the Khasa country take as wives the widows of their own brothers; these several people are not liable to undergo punishment or penance because of their doing these things in the respective countries'. Medie val writers differed about the meaning of the last half verse. The Madanaratna said (acc. to V. P. p. 22) that there is neither punishment nor prāyaścitta when the above practices which are opposed to smrti texts are indulged in by the inhabitants of the countries specified, while the V, P. P. 22 holds that there is only absence of punishment at the king's hands for these people in those countries, but they are still liable to undergo prāyaścitta and that if these practices are followed in other countries both punishment and prayascitta have to be undergone.

I Vol. 

Kat. 1672 defines what is meant by the customs of countries and families and states how and when they are to be enforced: 

That is said to be the custom of a country, which is in vogue in a country, is of long standing and is not opposed to the Veda and Smrti. That is called family custom which has come down hereditarily in a family as right conduct ( dharma) to be observed (by members of that family ); the king should pro serve it as it is. In disputes between the residents of the same country or capital, hamlet of cowherds, town or village the decision should be based on their own conventional usages, but in disputes between inhabitants of these and others the decision must be in accordance with the sacred texts. Therefore the king should decide the causes of people according to the rules of śāstra: but in the absence of texts he should carry out ( the administration of justice ) according to the usage of the coun try. Whatever conventions are settled in accordance with the consent of the people of a ) country should always be preserved in writing sealed with the royal seal. Such conventions should be sedulously upheld as if they were the dictates of sāstra and the king should decide ( disputes ) after carefully consider ing them.' Here Kāt. is principally concerned with the decision of legal disputes on the basis of the customs of countries and fainilies, but his rules also have a general application. He also states that in the case of the conflict of laws by which the parties are governed śāstra prevails. Pita maba 1673 has a similar verse about the usages of towns, villages and guilds and mentions that Bṛ. hold the same view. Manu also (VII. 3 ) requires the king to decide the disputes of people according to principles drawn from local customs ( detadrsta hetu ) and from the Institutes of law ( śāstradıṣta). Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 3 ) gives some interesting illustrations of local customs; viz. in certain southern localities a sonless widow

occupies a square low table in the hall of justice, when she is struck with dice by the judicial officers and then she gets her husband's property (this is a reminiscence of Nirukta III. 5 explaining Rg. I. 25. 7), in the north there is a custom that when certain persons come on behalf of a bridegroom seeking for a virgin in marriage and they are fed at the house of the girl's father then it is implied that there is a promise to give that girl in marriage to that particular bridegroom. These two customs are not opposed to any sruti or smrti (and even the V. P. p. 10 refers to the second as prevalent in the north and Madhyadesa ). But Medhātithi mentiong other local usages that are opposed to smṛti e. g. grain is lent in spring and in the autumnn of tho same year double of it is taken. This is opposed to the rules of smrti laying down rates of interest. 

Very difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force of sruti, smṛti and sadācāra and numerous rules have been laid down in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them. As Manu II. 6, Vas. 1. 4-5 and Yāj. I. n mention the sources of dharına to be sruti, smrti and sadācara in that order, the Mitāk sarā remarks 1674 that ' in case of conflict, each preceding one of those three has more force (or binding character ) than each succeeding one.' Sruti or Veda is recognised by all smrti writers as the highest or supreme authority for those who desire to know what dharma 1675 is (vide Manu II. 13 and Yāj. I. 40). If two vedic texts of equal authority are in conflict, then Gaut 1676 1. 5, Manu II. 14 and Jābāli declare that there is an option. For example, there are two Vedic texts 'he takes the sodasin cup in the Atirātra sacrifice' and 'be does not take the sodasin cup in the Atirātra'. In this case there is an option. Similarly Vedic texts say that the daily Vedic agnihotra may be performed after sunrise, or before sunrise or when neither the sun nor stars are visible. Therefore there is an option, viz. the daily agni hotra offering may be made at any one of the three times speci fied (Manu II. 15). But a vedic text which is in apparent con flict with another is not always of equal force with that other. In such a case there is no option, and various rules are laid

down in the Pārvamināmsā some important ones among which will be discussed at length in the section on Pūrvamsmāmsā. Such texts may be explained by holding that one lays down a general rule (sāmānya), while the other lays down a special rule ( viśeṣa ) or an exception, or that one is a vidhi and the other merely an arthavāda or that the two texts have different scopes or refer to different ages &c. All these rules about the interpretation of Vedic texts have been held to apply to smrti passages. For example, Manu VIII. 381 is a general rule abso lutely prohibiting the killing of a brābmana. While Manu VIII. 350 allowing the killing of a brāhmaṇa in self-defence is a special rule or may be regarded as a mere artha vāda ( viz. even a guru who is really not to be killed on any account may be killed when he is an atatāyin, what of others, as the Mit, on Yāj. II. 21 explains). Similarly Manu VIII. 351 saying that there is no fault (i.e. no sin, no punishment and no prayaścitta) in playing an ātatayin has restricted scope as applying only to an atatāyin who is not a brahmaṇa. A few more examples will be given immediately. below. 

## Conflict between śruti und smṛti

In cases of conflict between śrutiand smrti, the rules laid down by the Pūrvamimāmsā have already been explained (pp. 839-34). Jaimini VI. 1. 13-14 and Sabara furnish an example. If, relying on Manu VIII. 416, the pūrvapakṣa were to argue that women own no wealth and so should not engage in a vodic sacrifice then as that smrti so interpreted is opposed to the Veda it may be discarded by women 1677, Smṛtis also lay down certain gene rul rules on that point. Laugākṣi 1678 and Jābāla lay down that in case of contradiction between śruti and smrti, the former has greater force and that if there is no contradiction then what is laid down in the smrti should be observed as if it were laid down by the Veda. The Mit, on Yaj. III. 46 admits that a proposit ion of the Veda cannot be set aside (lūdhita ) by even a special proposition in a smrti text. But in spite of the general proposi. tion commentators like Vibyarūpa, Medhātithi and Vijñānesvara

had to admit that what was laid down by śruti texts was set aside or contradicted or abandoned by smrti texts or by popular sentiment. After the Udayaniya (concluding iṣti) in the Agni. stoma sacrifice was finished, a rite was prescribed by Vedic texts in which a barren cow (called Anūbandhyā) was sacrificed for Mitra and Varuṇa. But later on this was condemned and in lieu of a cow. amikṣā ( mixture of heated milk and curds ) was substituted. Vide H. D. II. pp. 1200-1201 for the anūbandhyā cow and p. 628 n. 1198 above for the verse quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 117 condemning cow sacrifice in Kaliyuga. Yāj. III. 234 puts govadha ( slaughter of a cow ) at the head of upapātakas. Medhātithi on Manu IV. 176 after stating that even such acts as donating all one's property in the Viśvajit sacrifice or killing a cow should not be done ( though sanctioned by the Veda) remarks that he gives that explanation following his predecessors' views but that to him it appears that an express śruti text cannot be set aside by a smrti passage 1679. Viśvarūpa also ( on pp. 25-26 ) after adverting to the fact that Yāj. III. 234 places govadha at the head of Upapatakas remarks that this may apply to the killing of cows spoken of in smrtis such as at the time of samāvartana (vide Manu III. 3) and that the rule must be upheld that a smrti that is, in confict with an express text of the Veda is to be set aside. Sometimes even a smrti text though theoretically weaker than śruti was allowed to prevail over a śruti. For example, the Veda prescribes the filling of the cups of wine in Sautrāmaṇi iṣṭi, but this is one of the matters prohibited in Kali 1680 (vide cliapter on Kalivarjyas below). 

The general rule is that when a custom or usage is opposed to the text of the Veda the latter must prevail. So early a writer as Āpastamba states this rule emphatically in several places. In Āp. Dh. 8. I. 1. 4. 8 it is stated 1681 : "For, an explicit śruti text has greater force than ācāra (usage) from which a śruti text (on which it may be supposed to be based )

may be inferred.' In I. 11. 30. 8-9 Ap. Dh. S. gays, during the morning and evening twilights a snātaka should be seated outside the village and should restrain his speech ( should not speak about worldly matters ); but (an agnihotrin must not go out for) what is enjoined by sruti is of more force in case of conflict of duties'. Similarly in Ap. II. 9. 23. 8-9, 'It is the settled view of those who are deeply learned in the three Vedas that they are (highest) authority. They consider that the rites which are there prescribed for performance with rice, yuva, animals, clarified butter, inilk, potsherds ( in conjunction) with the wife and accompanied by loudly or inaudibly recited (mantras ) must be performod and that a usage opposed to these rites is without authority'. In spite of this and the doctrine of the Pūrvamiināmsā stated above (p. 843) usages sprang up that were opposed to or gave the go-by to the prescriptions of the Veda as will appoar a little below and particularly in the section on Kalivarjya. 

The conflict of sınṭtis among themselves presents much greater difficultiex. From very ancient times authors of smrtis differed greatly among themselves. A few striking examples may be cited: Āp. Dh. S. (1. 6. 19. 2-12) cites the views of ten predecessors on the question of the persons whose food may be partaken of by a brāhmana (kui iiśyānnuh). The difference between Gautama and Baudhāyana on the one hand and Āp. on the other on the question of the validity of certain usages in certain localities has already been referred to (p. 858). In III. 16 Manu mentions three views ( and four sages) on the question of the position of a brālmana who marries a śūdra wife or has a son or a child from her. Baud. Dh. S. I. 8.2, Manu III. 13, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 24. 1-4, Pār. Gr. I. 4, Vas. I. 25 show that brāhmāṇas were allowed to have sūdra women as wives. But Yāj. 1. 56 empha tically dissents from this by stating 'this is not my view'. In this state of affairs the medieval digests and commentators were hard put to it to evolve rules of interpretation. One rule early evolved was that when two smrti texts were in oonfict, * reasoning based on the practices of elders ( śistas ) was of grea tor force' (Yaj. II. 21 ) 1682. The Mit. explains that ratiocina

tion may take the form of holding that one text lays down a general rule and the other lays down a special rule(which prevails over a general rule ), or the text may be held to relate to diffe. rent sets of circumstances or in the last resort it may be held that there is an option, but in arriving at these conclusions the practice of the old or of śistas who follow the rule in one text and discard or avoid the rule in the other text is the guide 1683. Br. 1684 gives the following warning to those who do not take reasoning into consideration: The decision (in a cause ) should not be given by merely relying on śāstras, for in the case of a decision devoid of reasoning loss of dharına results'. Nār. ( L. 40 ) provides in a strain similar to the Mit., 'wlien there is conflict between two texts of dharmaśāstra, it is declared that the method to adopt is to resort to reasoning, for the practices (of śistas ) are of great force and the strict letter of the law is overruled by them (or properly understood through them)'. These provisions remind us of the working of the principle of requitus applied by the prætors in Rome to the rigid older legislation or the influence of Equity in English Law. When

Surajranı 33 Bom. 433 at p. 439 Yāj, II, 21 is rendered as 'where there is a conflict between two or more smrtis that one should be accepted, which is conformable to equity', The former rendering is rather obscure and the latter does not translate Yaj, closely. The exact meaning of' equity' in this translation is not clear. It certainly does not mean equity' in the strict sense of English Law.

old rules become too narrow or are deemed to be not in harmony with the views of a changing or progressive society, it was thought to be the privilege of the king or the judge to adopt his practice to the existing state of society and not to decide a case by a too strict adherence to ancient dicta. 

Another rule that was laid down was that in case of con flict between dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra, the fornier is of more weight or authority or that one should discard the rule in 

the arthaśāstra 1685 (Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 23; Yāj. II. 21; Nār. I. 39; Kāt. 20 ). Vide pp. 8-9 above for an explanation of this rule. The rule of the arthaśāstra has the accomplishment of a visible or worldly purpose as the goal, while the dharmaśāstra rule has as its purpose the securing of unseen or spiritual results. Therefore the latter from a spiritual or ethical point of view is superior to the former. 

Soveral other methods of resolving conflicts between smṛtis may be mentioned here. Br. 1686 states: 'Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position because it puts together the purport of the Vedas; that smrti which is in conflict with the purport of Manu is not commended'. Angiras also states that to follow the words (of another smrti) disregarding the unrivalled dharmaśāstra of Manu would not be beneficial to a person. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 300 speaks of the Manusmrti and others as the great smrtis (maha-smrti). Some writers 1687 quote the Vedic text'whatever Manu said is indeed medicine' in this connec tion, thereby identifying the author of the Manusmrti with the Manu named in the Vedas. But this does not afford much help. Another principle evolved was that certain rules of conduct and certain smrtis were of special authority in certain cycles of time. Manu (I. 85-86 = Santi 232. 27-28 = Parāśara I. 22-23

Usages of several yugas differ 

869 

Br̥hat-Parāśara I. p. 55) himself says that the dharmas differ according to which of the four yugas is current, viz. tapos is the highest dharma in the Kṭta age, knowledge in Tretā, yajña in Dvāpara and only dūna in Kali. This verse only means that in a particular yuga the predominant or easily per formed dharma is the one indicated but the verse does not mean that a dharma predominant in one yuga was prohibited in another. Parāśara I. 24 1688 ( = Bphat-Parāśara I. p. 55) declares that in the Kr̥ta age the dharnas (to be observed ) were those promulgated by Manu, in Tretā those of Gautama, in Dyāpara those of Saṅkha-Likhita and in Kali those of Parasara. This also did not solve all difficulties, since the medieval digests and commentaries found that even what was allowed by Parāśara came to be disapproved of or condemned by the people. Many prescriptions of the smṛtis were therefore included under Kali ruerjyn (acts forbidden in the Kali age) on the ground that action, though at one time prescribed or sanctioned by the sāstra, should not be resorted to, if it has become hateful to the people, since it would not lead to heaven 1689 (if persisted in). This was the dictum of Yaj. I. 156 ( = Bphan-Nāradiya-purāṇa 24.12 ), Manu IV. 176, Viṣṇu Dh. S. (71. 84-85), the Viṣṇupurana (III. 11.7 ), Sukra III. 64, Bārhaspatya-sūtra ( on Arthaśāstra ) V. 16. Vide p. 630 and n. 1202 above. These texts were relied upon for prohibiting certain acts (though done in former times) by the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 117, III. 18), V. P. (p. 442 ) and others, But these devices of interpretation also proved futile in certain cases. On the question of the periods of mourning due to death for ksatriyas and others the texts are so various and so confic ting that even the great Vijñāneśvara declares (on Yāj. III. 22 ) that he is not going to furnish any orderly presentation of the smrti texts assigning to each its proper province, since it would be useless to do so in view of the fact that the usage of śiṣṭas did not agree with most of them 1690. Viśvarūpa also (on Yaj. III. 30) is in the same predicament. The commentators (such as

Madhava in Par. M. on I. 1. p. 84) were aware that people would not go in for religious practices that called for great effort and would seek for such rules as would be easy of observance. 1691 

In some cases it was provided tliat where there is a conflict among smptis the view of the majority should prevail. Gobhila sinrti (III. 148-149) provides 1692 that where there is a conflict among passages (of smrtis ), authoritativeness rests with that view which is supported by a majority of the texts, but where two passages are of equal authority then reasoning has to be einployed. The assumption or axiom was, according to Medha tithi1693 ( on Manu II. 29 and XI. 216), Mit. (on III. 325), Sun, C. (I. p. 5), Apararka p. 1053, Madanapārijāta (pp. 11, 91 ) and otliers that all smṛtis form one śāstra, that if some smrti texts on the same subject are in conflict there is an option and when there is no conflict all rules from all smrtis should be held applicable to the subject matter; this was based on the analogy of the maxiin called 'sarva-śākhāpratyayanyāya' or 'śākhān taradhikarana ' ( vide Jai. II. 4.9 and Sabara thereon). 

It is further provided that works of heretical sects were to be left out of consideration. Manu calls thern emptis, but they 

are outside the pale of Vedic orthodoxy. Manu (XII. 95) declared, 1694 + the smrtis that are outside the ( pale of) Veda. and all false or fallacious doctrines are of no avail after death, because they are all based on ignorance'. In the Vedantasūtra (II. 1. 1) also the word smrti is applied to the works on the

Heretical works have no authority 

871 

Saṅkhya philosophy. The Tantravārtika (p. 195) says that the Bauddhas and other heretical sects do not admit that their doctrines are based on the Veda, like a bad son hating his parents ; the prescriptions contained in their works are opposed to all the 14 vidyās except in the case of a few sentences laying down restraint of senses, charity and the like; they were proinulgated by persons like the Buddha who had given up the path of the Veda and did acts contrary to the Veda and they were propounded to persons that were beyond the pale of the three Vedas and that mostly were sūdras and persons outside the system of the four varṇas and āśrainas. Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 adopts this and remarks 1695 that the Sākyas, Bhojakas and Ksapapakas do not admit the Veda as authoritative, they openly declare the Veda to be unauthoritative and they teach doctrines directly opposed to the Veda. The Caturvimśatimata 1696 states that the words of Arhat (Jina), of Cārvāka and of Bauddhas, should be abandoned as they lead to delusion. 

Then comes the question of the conflict between smstis and purāṇas. It has been shown in the H, of Dh., vol. I. pp. 160–167, how the Purāṇas are rich in Dharmaśāstra material. The sūtras and early smrtis do not look upon the Purāṇas as a source of dharma, though Gaut. XI, 19 and Yāj. I. 3 mention Purāpa as one of the classes of works on which the king or any one else may draw for knowledge of dharma and though the Āp. Dh, S. quotes from a Purana in 1. 6. 19. 13, 1. 10. 29. 8 and II. 9. 23. 3 and names a Bhaviṣyatpurāṇa in II. 9. 24. 6. It is to be noted that the views quoted by Āp. from the Purāṇas in the first three passages are opposed to the views of the Kalivarjya section alleged to be taken from the Adityapurāṇa in medieval digests. The passage of the Tantra vārtika stating that Puranas, Manusmrti and Itihasa are universally accepted throughout India has been already quoted (on p. 853). When Manu states that smrti is a source of dharma he does not obviously com prehend Purāṇas under smrti as Manu II. 10 clearly shows ( dharmaśāstrar tu vai smirtih). Manu III. 232 and Yāj. III. 189 employ the plural 'Purāṇāni' and so those smrtis obviously

knew several Purāṇas and Medhātithi notes that they were composed by Vyāsa and described the creation of the world &c. The Striparva (13.2) also employs the plural and the Svargā rohanikaparva (5. 46-47) speaks of Krsna Draipāyana as the author of 18 Purāṇas. The Adiparva 1697 (1. 293-94) prescribes that one should strengthen the Veda by. (the study of) the Itihāsa and Purāṇa and that the Veda fears the man whose knowledge is insignificant 'this man will harm me'. Accord ing to the Bhāgavata-purāṇa I. 4. 25 the purpose 1698 of the composition of the Mahābhārata was this that as the Veda cannot be learnt by women, sūdras and brāhmaṇas who are so only by birth ( and do not study) the sage Vyāsa took com passion on them and composed the Mahābhārata for their bene fit. The same must be deemed to be the purpose of the com position of the purāṇas. The Dakṣasmrti II. 69 prescribes 1699 the recitation of itihāsa and purāṇa in the 6th and 7th parts of the day (divided into 8 parts). The Auśanasa smrti (III. p. 515, Jivananda) prescribes the study of the Veda in the bright half of the months from Māgha after utsarjana and the study of the Vedāngas and of Purāṇa in the dark half. It appears that some at least of the extant Purāṇas were composed in the first centuries of the Christian era and that from early times they contained dharmaśāstra material. In another section the paurānadharina will be separately dealt with hereafter. Gradually the Puranas became very popular in the course of centuries, some of the original rites prescribed by the Veda and the early smrtis went out of vogue and new modes of worship and rites provided by the Purāṇas came into general obser vance, The Vedavyāsa smrti 1700 (1. 4) and the Sangraha state that in case of conflict between smrti and purāṇa smrti is to be

Relative authority of smrtis and purāṇas

· preferred. Aparārka (p. 9) quotes 1701 a smrti text, 'that is highest dharma which is understood from the Veda, that is to be known as inferior dharma that is declared in the Purāṇas and the like'. Aparārka (p. 15) further tells us that 1702 accor ding to the Bhaviṣyatpurāṇa the purāṇas are of authority in declaring dharma that is vyāmiśra (i. e. mixed up and not purely Vedic). Medieval writers were often divided as to the authoritativeness of purāṇas. Mitramisra (in his commen tary 1903' on Yāj. II. 21) asserts that dharmaśāstra (viz. smsti) is not more authoritative tha n purāṇa and that in case of con flict between a smrti text and a purana text recourse must be had to reasoning as in the case of conflict between two smptis. On the other hand, the V. Mayūkha, 1704 after quoting Manu IX. 126 and Devala about the first born among twins being regarded as the oldest and after referring to a half verse from the Bhagavatapurāṇa (rather from the commentary of Sridhara thereon) which holds that among twins the one born later is to be deemed as the elder, remarks that the Purāṇa passage is to be set aside in favour of the sinsti passages and that in the purāṇas usages opposed to the smrtis are very frequently met with. It further says that this view is preferable to that of some others according to whom in this matter the custom of the country should be followed. The Nirnayasindhu (III. p. 251 ) also says the same. The respect for the purāṇas carried away late medieval writers so far that relying on some pro phetic passages in the purāṇas about the disappearance of four varpas in the Kali age and the subsistence of only brāh manas and sūdras therein, they denied the existence of ksatriyas and vaisyas in the Kali age, in spite of the fact that all smṛtis (like Manu, Yāj., Parāsara) and many commentaries (including the Mitākṣarā) hold that the four varṇas exist in the Kali age.

On Manu IV. 176 Medhātithi points out that niyoga is permitted by such omstis 1706 a8 Gaut. 18.4-14, Yāj. I. 68-69, Vas. 17. 56-65, but being condemned by the people it is not practised. There fore the principle that may be deduced from these is that the prescriptions of smṛtis ( and oven of śruti) need not be observed and should not be observed when they are vehemently condemned by the people. The chapter on Kalivarjya will make this clear, Commentators like Medhātithi (on Manu II. 10) went 80 far as to say that Dharmasastra is that which prescribes what is to be done for attaining dharma, that is smrti from which dharma which one performs as a duty is understood and there fore sistā cāra 1707 also is smrti. The smrtis theinselves embodied the practices of the people current in their days, as Manu I. 107 declares, ' in this work dharma has been fully stated as well as the good and evil qualities of (human ) actions and the ancient customs and usages of the four varṇas.' 1708 Manu adds (I. 108), 

acara ( customs and usages) are transcendental law, and so are the practices declared in the Veda and the smrti; therefore a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always

make efforts to follow it '. 1709 This has been the basic text in modern decisions that recognize the binding nature of customs. It is therefore necessary to understand the exact meaning of this verse. Two constructions are possible; (1) that the word ācāra is qualified by the words. śrutyukta' and 'smārta' and that the first half declares that usages declared in the Veda or smrti are transcendental law (this is the meaning given by most commentators of Manu ); (2) that acāra by itself and other rules of conduct declared in the sruti or smrti are transcen dental (i. e. here in the first half of the verse there is a reference to three kinds of ācāras, as Govindaraja and Nandana explain ). If we look to the preceding verse and the following verses ( that eulogise ācāra ) the 2nd construction looks more natural and has been accepted by the decided cases when 1710 they lay down that * immemorial usage is transcendental law' (Sir William Jones' translation of Manu I. 108) and that "under the Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the law". The Anuśāsana (141. 65) and Santi 354. 6 expressly state that dharma is threefold viz. that declared in the Veda, that declared in the smrtis and the third is what is practised by sistas. Sumantu 1711 emphatically declares that family usage should be preferred to the prescriptions of sāstra. The Kūrmapurāṇa 1712 ( Uttarardha 15. 19) appears to support the and interpretation when it says, 'one should observe that acara which is declared by the sruti and smrti and which is rightly followed by the good'. The exact import of the word acāra (or gadācāra ) has been shifting from age to age and among com mentators. In the earliest days, as shown by the Tai. Up., Gaut. (28. 48, 51 ), Baud. Dh. 8.

[Vol. 

Vas. I. 6, the acāra to be followed was that observed or declared by learned brāhmanas who were highly moral and selflegs (the śistas ). Medhātithi on Mann II. 6 states that binding acāra is that of sistas learned in the Vedas. Gradually every usage that had no visible secular purpose came to be looked upon as binding and lastly the usages of sūdras, of pratiloma castes and even of heterodox sects became, as will be shown in the sequel, enforceable by the king. As observed in 39 Mad. 298, 301 the commentarios indicate an attempt to reconcile the text law with the actual usages of the people. 

The requisites of valid customs, according to the smrtis and commentaries and digests, are similar to those laid down by the writers on Pūrvamimāmsā i, e, they must be ancient, must not be opposed to sruti and smrti, must be such that they are regard ed by respectable people as obligatory on them and such as are observed with that consciousness by the sistas, they must be strictly construed and cannot be availed of by others not within their purview and must not be immoral or severely condemned by popular sentiment. Customs once in vogue may be abandon ed by the people as the chapter on Kalivarjya will show. 

From Gaut., Manu, Bp., Kāt. and other writers quoted above it follows that the customs and usages of which account has to be taken are those of districts ( deśa or janapada ), towns and villages, castes, families, guilds or corporations or groups (gana, śrepi, sangha, naigama, varga). A few words on each of these and on usages of gotrus and sākhas will be said later on and a few illustrations of each will be given. But first of all certain preliminary observations have to be made about customs in general. The medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra make it clear that customs that depart from the generally received smrti prescriptions must be strictly construed and that they cannot be extended on the ground of analogy to other matters outside the specific acknowledged customs. For example, both the Sm. O.(I.. 71) and the Smrtimuktāphala 1713 (on Varpāśrama p. 31) say that, though one's maternal uncle's daughter can be married (by custom) yet one's mother's sister or mother's sister's daughter

cannot be married, because popular sentiment is opposed to the latter kind of marriages and popular sentiment has to be respected as Manu declares (in IV. 176). Similarly the Samskara kaustubha 1714 and the Dharmasindhu provide that where there is a local or family usage for narrowing down the limits of sapiṇda relationship in marriage, only those who belong to that locality or family can avail themselves of such narrowing down, but if a person in a different locality or belonging to a different fainily were to follow the practice of narrowing down the sapinda relationship, he would incur blame. Owing to the vastness of Bharatavarṣa it was recognised that what was sadācāra in one country would not be so in another, as is noted by the Par. M. (I. 2. p. 65 ) in relation to marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter,1715 

A few words may now be said about customs of countries. That usages about details of ritual varied a great deal even in the Vedic times is quite clear. The Sat. Br. (1. 1. 4. 13 ) notes that in former times it was the wife of the sacrificer that rose at the Hayiṣkpt call, but that in its own day the wife or a priest ( the Agnidhra) rises in angwer to the call. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1027 and n. 2311 on the Haviskrt call. For similar differences in practices vide the same Brahmana XII. 3. 5.1 and XII. 6. 1. 41. The Ait. Br. frequently refers to one view and refutes it by saying that one should not do so (tat tatha na kuryāt ) or one should discard it (tat tat nādrtyam ) e. g. vide . chap. 12. 7, 17. 1, 18. 8, 28.1, 29.5. Vide also Tai, Br. I. 1. 8, I. 3,1, III. 8.8 for similar words.

noted above (pp. 856-857). Baudhāyana made a distinction about the customs of the northern and southern people ( countries ). That customs of the northern and southern countries differed is emphasized by many commentators and writers of digests. For example, the Mit, on Yāj. I. 256 refers to the differing views of dakśiṇātyas and udicyas on Ekoddista-śrāddha. Śhaṅkara bhatta in the introductory verses of the Dvaitanirṇaya (or Dharma-dvaita-) expressly states that he will furnish solutions of knotty points in Dharmaśāstra after abiding by the views of southern writers. 1716 The Nirnayasindhu in its section on sāpiṇdya speaks of Sūlapāṇi, Vācaspati and Suddhiviveka as Gaudas and Maithilas, and points out that Sūlapāni in the Sambandha viveka and the Sambandhatattva (a Gauda work) allow marriage with a girl separated by three gotsas from the bride groom, while the southern writers ( dākṣiṇatyas ) do not accept the view. But in those days there were no rigid territorial boundaries for certain practices or doctrines. For example, Vijñāneśvara, Madana-ratna, Pārijāta, Vācaspati and Sūlapāṇi accepted the view that sāpindya arises from community of the particles of the body, while Aparārka, Smrticandrika and Madhava ( though they were southern writers like Vijñānesvara) held that sāpiṇdya was based on the offering of pinda in śrāddhas. The fashion of dividing Hindu works into schools and assigning them definite territorial limits started with Colebrooke and has been perpetuated by decisions of the Privy Council and of the Indian High courts. Vide Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Mad. I. A. 397 at p. 432 (for reference to Colebrooke), p. 435 ( as to how schools arose ), pp. 436-437 (as to different schools ). Strange results have flowed from this. The Vyavahāra mayūkha, written by Nilakaptha, whose family belonged to Paithan in Mahārāstra and migrated to Benares and who himself wrote under the patronage of a Bundella chief, came to be regarded as a work of the highest authority in Gujerat and North Konkan (even superseding the Mitākṣarā ), while in Mahārāṣtra proper its authority is subordinate to that of the Mitakṣarā. The Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) avers that in the section on the partition of heritage the texts generally repeat what is

already current among the people 1717 and that if Yāj. II. 118-119 were interpreted to mean that the words' what is acquired at the cost of paternal estate by a person himself' stand by themselves and do not qualify the other clauses, then what is acquir ed through friendship even at the cost of the paternal estate would not be liable to partition, which would be opposed to the practice among people. The Vyavahāra-mayūkha also 1918 says on Manu IX. 210 ( about reunion) that the law and administra tion of justice are generally based as is the case with grammar on people's usages. The Viramitrodaya also states that all writers of digests are agreed that smrtis on Vyavāhara generally re-iterate recognized popular usages. 

Customs of countries and families have been specially recognized from very ancient times in the sphere of marriage. The Āśv. gr. (I. 7, 1-2 ) has been already cited above (p. 856 ). The commentators on Āśy. gp., Haradatta and Nārāyaṇa, both mention that in certain countries sexual intercourse is com menced immediately after marriage, that this practice is oppos ed to the rule in Aśv. g£. I. 1. 10 that the married couple should be celibate after marriage for at least three nights (if not for a longer period ) and that one should follow the rule laid down in the gļhyasūtra and not the usage of the country. The Āp. gr. (II. 15 ) remarks, 1719 ' people should understand from women (and others ) what procedure is (to be followed according to the custom of the country )' and the commentator Sudarśanā. carya notes that certain rites like the worship of planets, ankurūropana and the tying of pratisara ( a string or ribbon tied round the wrist) are usual and are performed with Vedic Mantras. The Kathakagshya ( 25. 7) allows the usages of countries and families to be observed in marriage and the

commentators mention some usages, viz. Devapāla refers to stat ing the purpose of the visit, announcing the name of the maiden, worship of family deity, striking with flowers and creepers. The com. Brāhmaṇabala states that in Kashmir'at the time of marriage the mother-in-law or some other woman whose husband is alive ties an auspicious wreath on the heads of the bride and the bridegroom, that the mother-in-law places flowers on the feet, knees, shoulders and head of the bridegroom and on the same seven places of the bride's body flowers are placed but in the reverse order ( i. e. first on the left limb and then on the right), 

Haradatta on Gaut. XI. 20 (cited above in n. 1662) mentions the following usages: in the Cola country while the sun is in the zodiacal sign of Aries maidens draw with powders of various colours on the ground an orb of the sun together with attendants and offer worship in the morning and evening; on the full moon day of Margasirṣa maidens putting on ornaments walk about in the village and offer to a temple idol whatever they get in their wanderings; when the sun is in the sign of the Crab, maidens worship the goddess Umā while the moon is in the constellation of the Pūryā Phalgunis and offer to the gods mudga beans that have put forth sprouts and salt; when the sun is in the sign of Pisces, house-holders worship the Goddess of wealth while the moon is in the constellation of Uttarā Phalguni, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13,7 notes that in certain countries the special portions of the eldest son in paternal wealth are gold, dark-coloured cattle and black-coloured produce of the soil (i. e. black grain). Vide Bp. and Tantravārtika quoted above ( as to customs of certain countries). 

Several such illustrations may be furnished from other writers, but considerations of space make it necessary to omit reference to them. 

The Pār. gr.,8. 1 8 states 1720 that the usages of villages may be followed, since a text says 'one should enter a village (i. e, follow the opinion of village elders ) in case of marriage and funeral rites' and since the Veda says that 'the village is the authority in these two.'

Caste customs 

881 

Numer ous caste customs have been recognized from ancient times to these days. Gaut. XI. 20, Vas. I. 17, Manu I. 118, VIII. 41 and 46, Kaut. III. 7, Sukra IV. 5. 47 emphasize the validity of caste customs and call upon the king to enforce them. Yaj. I. 361 advises the king to punish those who swerve from the usages of their family, caste, guild, or group. Katya yana (40) enjoins 1721 that the king should not disregard the fixed usages even of pratiloma castes and of the inhabitants of inaccessible places (mountain forts or habitations ), even if they be opposed ( to the rules of smrtis ). In the Paribhāsa prakasa Mitramiśra holds 1722 that the usages of good sūdras, free from moral defects are binding on their sons and others even though they do not know the Veda. 

Compared to Western Christian countries very great religious tolerance prevailed in ancient India. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 388 (n. 928 a), 723-724 for some remarks on this. Asoka in his Pillar Edict VII (E. I. vol. II. p. 272 ) says that he looked after sanghas, brāhmaṇas, Ājivakas and all other sects (pāṣanda ). The Bhagavadgitā (IX. 23-25 ) proclaims that the devotees that worship other gods do worship Krsna himself though in an irregular way and that those who offer worship to the Manes or to the elements reach the goals they desire. The Mānasollasa enjoins 1723 that one should give up condemnation of or hatred towards other gods, that one should show reverence on seeing an image or a temple and should not pass it over (in contempt ). People of different countries no doubt twitted each other on the customs and usages peculiar to each; but it rarely went beyond the bandying of words. For example, even such a

philosophical work as the Jivanmuktiviveka remarks 1724 that brahmanas of the south condemn even the learned brāhmaṇas of the north as flesheaters and brāhmaṇas of the north condemn southern brāhmaṇas because they marry their maternal uncle's daughters and because they carry earthen vessels in fairs or on pilgrimages. It was on account of the general attitude of religious tolerance that the smrtis and digests prescribe that open the usages of heretical sects should be enforced by the king. Yāj. II. 192 prescribes 1725 that the king should guard against breach of the distinctive usages and conventions of guilds (of artisans), of traders, of heretical sects and bands (of soldiers). Narada (samayasyānapakarma 1-3) states 1736 that the king should uphold the conventions of heretical sects, of traders, guilds and other groups and that whatever traditional usages, activities, mode of attendance and means of maintenance were peculiar to them should be permitted to them by the king without introducing any change. Among the matters of which the king was to take cognizance suo motu and included under prakirṇaka by Nārada (verse 2) was the transgression of the usages of heretics, traders, guilds and ganas, Brhaspati provides 1721 that in disputes among husbandmen, artisans, wrestlers, money lenders, guilds, dancers, heretics, thieves, a decision is to be given in accordance with their conventions. It is no doubt true that certain smrtis present a sterner treatment of heretics and

Treatment of heretics and the like

the like. Gaut. IX. 17 provides 1723 that a snataka should not talk with mlecchas, impure persons and sinners. Manu IX, 225 prescribes that the king should banish from his capital gamblers, dancers, heretics, vintners &c. Manu IV.30 holds that one should not honour as guests even by words persons who are heretios, rogues &c. and recommends that one should not reside in a country which is overrun by groups of heretics. Yāj. II. 70 and Nār. (rṇādāna 180 ) say that a heretic (pākhandi) or an atheist is not a proper witness. These passages may be explained in various ways. Probably the prescriptions of Gautama and Manu refer to an age when the schism caused by Buddhists and Jainas was not very old and feelings between the followers of the Veda and the heretics ran high. But most of these prescrip tions are addressed to the followers of the Veda as individuals. They do not negative the requirements laid down by Nār., Br. and others that the king ( though of a different persuasion ) was to enforce among heretics their own usages. It can be said without any fear of contradiction that at least from the 4th century A. D. onwards the policy of the State in India was to protect all religions, but to interfere with none '. 1729 

Customs of families will be briefly referred to later on in connection with modern law cases. Among family customs the customs about the year when caula was performed and the locks of hair kept on the head in the caula ceremony are frequently mentioned in the gphya sūtras and other works. Vide H. of Dh, 

vol. II pp. 260 and 265. 

The digests contain numerous examples about the customs and usages that were adhered to among the followers of the several Vedic branches (sākkās) and the gphya sūtras in perform ing several religious rites. A few examples may be set out here by way of illustration. According to Yaj. L 242 the offering of pindas to the pitss in a sraddha takes place after the brahmapas invited at the śrāddha are fed, while Manu III. 261 shows that they were offered also before the brāhmaṇas were fed. The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 471) says that one should follow the practice of one's own Vedic sakha. Among the five daily sacrifices ( mahāyajfias) one is pitryajña, which aco, to some ( such as Katyāyana ) means tarpaṇa, while according to Manu
