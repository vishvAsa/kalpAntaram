113. The Vīramitrodaya of Mitramiśra 

The Viramitrodaya is a vast digest composed by Mitramisra embracing almost all branches of Dharmasastra. Excepting the Caturvarga-cintamani of Hemādri, this work is probably the largest known on dharmaśāstra. But it surpasses in interest and usefulness even Hemādri's work since it deals with vyavahāra also. It was divided into sections called prakāśus. When the first edition of the His. of Dh. was published in 1930, the prakāśas on vyavahāra, Paribhāṣı, samskāra, rājaniti, āhnika. pojā, tirtha

and laksana had been published, the first by Jivananda (Cal cutta 1875) and the rest in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The text of the dayabhāga portion of the Vyavahāraprakāśa was also published by Golapchandra Sarkar Sastri with an English translation ( Calcutta 1879). It appears that Mitramiśra wrote on prāyaścitta also.1455 of the Prayaścittaprakasa there is a complete and well written ms. (No. 2610) in the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner and there is also another ms. of Laksaṇaprakāśa ( No. 239 p. 49 of Val. Cat. of. mss. in l. C. Desai collection). The very names of the sections of the Viramitrodaya convey an idea of the subjects dealt with in them. The Lakṣaṇa prakāsa deals with the auspicious signs of men, women, the several Parts of human body, elephants, horses, thrones, swords, bows and with the characteristics and qualities of the queen, the ministers, the astrologer, physician, door-keeper, description of śālagrāma, śivalinga, rudraksa beads etc. In the Ālinikaprakāśa he dilatcs upon the daily duties beginning with one's rising from bed on brāhmamuhurta, sauca, ācamana and ending with going to bed. The Vyavahāraprakasa is probably the leargest nibandha on vyzvahāra. This is divided into four parts The first part deals with the meaning of vyavahāra, the constitution of the sabha (court of justice ), the appointment of judges, conflict of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra, assessors, the various grades of courts, the procedure about plaints and defendant's replies and their faults; the burden of proof and and the means of proof. The second gives a detailed exposition of the means of proof, viz. witnesses, documents, possession and ordeals. The third treats of the eighteen titles of law including dāyavibhāga and the fourth very briefly speaks of those matters which were to be started suo motu by the king and not by a private individual. The dāyavibhāga portion of the Vyavahāraprakāśa occupies a little more than-one-fourth of the whole of the work. 

In the Tirthaprakāśa he deals with the naiure of tirthus, the utility thereof for men, the persons entitled to undertake pilgrim age, the proper times for pilgrimage, the ceremonial acts to be performed at tirthas such as shaving, fasts, bathing, gifts, the

description of the several varṣas and dvipas and of sacred rivers like the Ganges, Narmadā, sacred places like Gayā, Prabbāsa, Badri, Puskara and Puri. 

In the Pūjāprakāśa he speaks of the definition of pujā, persons entitled to perform pūjā ( worship of gods ), the rewards of pijā, proper times and places for pūjā, sālagrāma, the proper articles and clothes for the worship of idols, proper flowers, fragrant substances, naivedya, the detailed method of worshiping Viṣṇu, Śiva, the Sun, Durgā, Brahmā etc. In the printed edition there are no introductory verses here. 

In the Samskara-prakāśa the author enumerates the samskāras and describes in detail garbhādhāna, pumsavana, anavalobhana, simantonnayana, jātakarma, nāmakarana, śiśuniskramana, anna prāśana, cudā, upanayana, vivāha etc., the duties of brahmacārins, gotras, pravaras and sapind ya, all astrological matters in connec tion with marriage, pindapitryajña, sarpabali, aștakāśrāddha, 

śūlagava. 

The Rājanitiprakāśa treats of the definition of rājan, the proper time and procedure of coronation, the daily routine for kings, the qualifications of ministers, commander-in-chief and the dependents of king, forts, capital, places, the four expedients of sāma etc. the six gunas, auspicious and evil signs, marching for battle, Kaumudi and Indradhvaja festivals etc. 

In all his works Mitramiśra mentions hundreds of authors and works. The portion on vyavahāra is full of long-drawn controversies in which he refutes the views of numerous prede cessors. The Viramitrodaya enters into polemics far more fre quently than Nilakantha. He generally upholds the Mitakṣarā of Vijñāneśvara againts all its critics, particularly the writers of the Bengal school. But he does not slavishly admire the Mitākṣarā in every thing. Now and then he rebukes even Vijñānesvara. For example, he does not approve of what the Mitākṣarā says about the son called Kanina. 436 He finds fault with Vijñāneśvara's explanation of the verse anyodaryastu' as extremely forced and

far-fetched and as simply exhibtiing the author's pedantry, 1467 Out of the host of works and writers that he names in the vyavahāra section the important ones are noted below 1458 

The Viramitrodaya was held to be a work of high authority by the Privy Council in the Benares School of Hindu Law. The Vyavaharaprakasa was published in the Chowkhamba Series in 1932. The Privy Council has laid down that the Viramitro daya is properly receivable as an exposition of what may have been left doubtful by the Mitāksarā and declaratory of the law of the Benares school. ' 1459 Similarly it has been said by the same high tribunal that the Viramitrodaya may be referred to even in Bengal where the Dāyabhaga is silent.1460 But where the text of the Mitāksarā on any point is quite clear, the gloss of the Viramitrodaya on the text of any sage, which is in conflict with the rule laid down in the former, cannot be referred to for the purpose of casting a doubt on the clear rule of the Mitaksarā.1481 The Viramitrodaya is inferior to the Vyavahāramayukha in Western India 482 and its doctrines are not followed in those provinces when in conflict with those of the other two works. Their Lordships of the Privy Council say in Vedachala v. Subra

mania1463 • alothough the Smsticandrikā in the Southern Presi dency is regarded as the jinst authoritative commentary on Vijñāneśvara's work, the Viramitindo ya holds, as in Western India, a high position. It supplem:it many gaps and omissions in the earlier commentiries and susitates and elucidates with logical preciseness the meaning of dor:bu:i prescriptions.' 

There is a ms, of the Dan.jirkāśa in the Deccan College (No. 305 of 1884–1887). It is an extensive work and contains the usual topics about gifts. 

Besides the digest called Via Todaya, Mitramiśra composed a commentary on the smrti of Yajniralkya. The Com. of Mitra miśra on the Yajṅavalky"Smrti was published (after the first volume of the H. of Dh. had bzen sent to the Press ) in the Chow. khamba Sanskrit Series in several fascicules (from 1927-1930 ), Besides the works noteed abu've h: quotes the Karmapradipa and the Smṛtisāra. In this work 13 does not quite approve of the reasons for the preference slıown to the mother over the father as an heir by the Mitāksari, viz. the occurrence of the word

In the introductions to the several sections of his digest and also in the colophons therein Mitramiśra furnishes consider able information about himself, his family and the family of his patron. Mitramiśra was the son of Paraśurāma pandita and grandson of Hamsapandita. Hamsapandita seems to have been a native of Gopācala ( Gwalior) and was endowed with the rare combination of wealth and learning. One Candeśvara of Kasi was the guru of Parasu rāmapandita. Mitramisra indulges in hyperbolic1496 descrip tions of his own learning and naively tells his readers that they need study only his work and nay neglect all other nibandhas. Mitramiśra was commanded by Virasimha to compose his great digest.1467 The introduction to the Ahnika prakāśa starts with king Medinimalla who was a scion of the Kasirāja family. His son was Arjunadeva who became ruler of Bundelkhand. His son was Malakhāna, whose son was Pratāparudra (founder of the capital Orccha). In the commentary of Mitramisra on the Vyava hāra section of Yaj. Snnrti the serond verse begins 'आस्ते क्षोणि प्रशस्तिस्तनुरिव गिरिशम्बोंडछापूरपूर्वा' i. e. the capital is called ऑडछापूर (or 'पुर). His son was Madhukarasaha, whose son was Virasimha. Vide Dept. of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. XIII for a paper on Bir Singh Deo hy Mr. Lila Sitaram, (pp. 1–34 ) and a paper on ‘Nilakantha and Mitramiśra ' in Calcutta Review vol.

Jujbāra who is described as “young' (yuvā in verse 23). His son was Vikramārka whose son was Narasimhadeva. There is no such introduction to the printed Pajāprakāśa and Narasimhadeva is not mentioned in the intrcductions to the other prakāśas. From the article of Mr. Lala Sitaram in the Calcutta Review ( May and July 1924) further information can be gathered about Birsinghdeo (i. e. Virasimhadeva). In the article it is shown how and under what circumstances Virasini ia killed Abul Fazal, the friend of Emperor Akbar and a great literary genius. We are told there that there is a work called Virasimhadeva-carita composed in Vikrama year 1664 (1607-8 A. D.) by Kesavadasa, author of Kavipriya and Rasikapriyā. Virasi'nha was 7th out of the eight sons of Madhukarasāha. Not only was he a soldier, but he was a great builder. He built the palace forts of Orcchha and Datia, the temple of Keśavadeva at Mathurā, several lakes called Birasāgara, Simhasāgara and Deosāgara (after the three parts of his own name). He is said to have ruled at Orchha from 1605 to 1627 A. D. From the introduction to the commentary1469 on Yajna valkya it appears that Virasiniha commanded Mitramióra to write it and that a learned man Sadananda, the ornament to Tirabhukti (Tirhoot) received directions to collect materials from Mitramiśra who was a wealthy person. It will be seen that the title Virami trodaya very cleverly suggests that Mitramiśra wrote it under the patronage of Virasimhadeva. The title may mean 'the rise of Vira

and Mitra' or 'the rise of the friend of Vira' or 'the rise of the sun, viz. Vira'. 

The Introductory verses to several parts of the Viramitrodaya furnish information about the family of the author. 

The editor of the Vyavahiraprakasa ( Pandit Viṣṇu Prasad Bhandari) gives some ad 'iional information cbout Mitramiśra. It is stated that Mitramisra 10 timposed a campū called 

• Ānandakanda', at the end of which he zives soine information about his family and biww.f. lleur ā brahmana of the Sānnadhya class (a section of Gauda brāntaras); he had two elder brothers, named Vireévuna and Cakrapāni and a younger brother called Yoghiya ard a sister na:..cd Susiti. The editor quotes a verse (sze rots belu!):ccourting at the end of the Anandakanda-campu. 

The time when Mitramisra ficurished can be easily settled on account of his relations with Virusi ihadeva. In his Áhnika prakasa (vide footnote 1468 aboie ) he mentions the great-grand son of Virasiirha. Therefore ihal section must have been written when Virasiriha was advanced in age. Virasimha ruled at Orchha from 1605 to 1627. lunce ihe literary activity of Mitramiśra musi be placed in the first two quarters of the 17th century. This date agrees with the fact that he names Vācaspati and Raghunandan?. Ve thus see tai Miiramisra was almost a contemporary of Kamulakaribiatta and Nilai.antha. The two latter do not refer to him por does Mitraniśra name them.

The Paribhasiprakasa ( a small part extending to 116 printed pages) describes the genealogy of the family to which1471 Vira simha belonged, theil nmention: Ha.isapandita, who belonged to a brahmana family of Coracala (i. e. modern Gwalior ) whose son was Parasurānale (verse 30, wiose teacher was Candiśvara, verses 30-31 ), whose so I was ranisra ( verse 32) who be came a great favourite of king Virasimha (v. 35) by whose order the work (nalled Vira. vitroda a ) was composed by Mitra miśra (v. 36); twenty- o parts c. !led prakāśas were composed by Mitramiśr.. They arz: Paridhisi, Samskara, Ahnika, Pūjā, Pratișthā, Rājadharma. V: arnhjre, Saddhi, Śrāddha, Tirtha, Dana, Vrata, Samaya, Jyotis, Santi, Karmavipaka, Cikitsā, Prāyaścitta, Prakirṇaka, Lakṣara.

Among those published in the Chokirumba series, six cover about 500 or more printed pages caci viz. those on Sariiskāra, Ahnika, Laksana, Rajaniti, Tirta, Vyavathara. The Vyavaharaprakasa is a large work; it deals with legal procedure (viz. plaint, reply, evidence, witnesses, documents, po: session; oaths and ordeais); the eighteen titles of law (from nidana to Dayabhaga) i.e. it deals with both substitive ia, and adjective law.

It is not possible for reasons of space to give even briefly the contents of all the twenty-two parts of Viramitrodaya. 

An attempt has to be made to convey the matters dealt with in a few of the 22 parts. The Rājanitiprakāśa covers 493 printed pages. A very brief summary of it would be interesting.

He proposes to restrict the word Tirtha only to such places or rivers as are enumerated as tirthas by the learned or by great sages, 

He profusely quotes the Mahabharata in the Tirthaprakāśa. Tirthas are either Daiva (such as Vārāṇasi, Prabhasa, Puskara ), or asura (such as Gayā ); or ārsini (those that are established by sșis ) and mānusa are those establisbed by rulers of Surya vamsa or Somavamsa. Men of all varṇas and asramas are entitled to perform tirthayātrā (p. 19). The Mahābhārata and the Puranas are full of descriptions of tirthas and pilgrimages. Kuruksetra!474 as a tirtha is described in Vanaparva 83. 1-8. Vanaparva chapters 87-90 speak of the tirthas in the east, south, west and north respectively. Salyaparva (chapters 35-39) describes the tirthas which were visited by Balarama in

his pilgrimage. The Anusāsanaparsa ( chapter 26) is full of the greatness of the Ganges.l475 Two typical verses are quoted below from it. On p. 315 of the Rājanitiprakasa'176 he quotes a verse of Vyāsa in which different words are given to indicate what Daiva is and which distinguishes Purisakāra ( human effort ) from Daiva; vide also Manu VIl. 205, Yaj. 1. 349 and 351. Vanaparva (82.9-12) deals with this topic of Daiva and Purusakāra.1477 

___ In the Indian Historical Quarterly ( Vol. 24 for 1948 pp. 336-7) Pandit K. Madhav Krishna Sarma informs scholars that the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner has a ms, of the Mokṣa prakāsa. The first folio is missing. There are in all 342 paper folios, 8 lines on each page and 40 syllables in each line. The 

main topics dealt with are stated in the mote belkw.1578 

His Bhaktiprakāsa is a substantial work of 175 printed pages. In bis Introductory verses he states the philosophical doctrine that God is one, but he further states that Aukti is difficult; the mind does not give up all the worldly by matters. Therefore devotion to Hari is the only way. He mentions the nine aspects

of 'bhakti' (the verse is quoted below )1479 and dilates on them in pp. 31-128. He points out each of the nine aspects may be Sattviki, Rājasi or Tāmasi and expounds these. He mentions the Bhagavatapurāṇa and the commentator Sridharasvāmin fre quently. He frequently quotes the Puraras and the Bhagavad gitā. At the end (on pp. 134-175) he deals with 'bliajaniya nirṇaya' (exposition on the object of worship ). 

In the Vyangyārtha-kaumudi of Anantāsrana 180 of Punya stambha (Puṇtāmibe ) on the Godavari, a commentary on the Rasamañjari of Bhanudatta, the author gives a pedigree of his patron. He describes the Kāsirāja family at Benares, in which was born Prataparudra whose son was Madhukarasāha, whose son was Virasimhadeva. Ananta wrote the commentary for Candrabhānu, a son of Virasi hadeva, in 1635 A. D. This corroborates the dates above given by Mr. Lala Sitaram. There fore it is almost beyond doubt that the literary activity of Mitra misra lies between 1610 and 16-40 A. D.
