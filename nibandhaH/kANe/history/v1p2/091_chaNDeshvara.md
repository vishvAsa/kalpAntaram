91. Candeśvara 

Candesvara is the most prominent figure among Maithila nibandhakāras on Dharmaśāstra. He compiled an extensive digest called Smstiratnākara or simply Ratnākara. This digest was divided into seven sections viz, on kṛtya, dāna, vyavahāra, śuddhi, pūjā, vivāda and grhastha. 1143 Out of these the Vivāda ratnākara dealing with dāyabhāga and the other titles of law (vyavahārapadas ) has been printed in the B. I. Series and has been translated into English by Mr. G. C. Sarkar and by Mr. Justice Digambara Chatterjee. The Vivādaratnākara of Candesvara and the Vivādacintamani of Vacaspati are of para

Tirhut) so far as British Indian Courts are concerned.1144 

The Kștya-ratnākara deals in 22 tarangas with the discussion of Dharma ( its real nature, its rewards, means of knowing it and the occasions for it), the various vratas and observances in the several months from Caitra, the observances in the inter calary month, various vratas on the several days of the week, the Sun's passage into a new sign, eclipse on the new-moon day etc. This work is referred to in his Dānaratnakara, which in its turn is quoted in the Grhastha-ratnākara.1145 The work was printed in the Bibliotheca Indica Series in 1926. He belittles Kalpataru, Kamadhenu and Pārijāta. This was probably the first of the seven Ratnākaras, since it is mentioned first in the verse quoted below1148 and since it has a very large number of Introductory verses. 

The Gshastha-ratnākara is a very extensive work in 68 tarangas on the duties of householders. The work was printed in the Bibliotheca Indica Series in 1928, while the first vol. of H. of Dh. was in the Press. It is a large work in 591 pages. It has only two Introductory verses, the last quarter of the 2nd saying that this Ratnākara is full of Mimāmsā. Verses (3-20) enume rate briefly the topics of the 68 tarangas (waves i. e, chapters ) of this (Ratnākara which word also means 'sea'), which are :

The Vivādaratnākara is an extensive work (671 pages in print) in 100 tarungas on civil and criminal law and deals with the 18 titles of law such as dāyabhūga (on partition and inheri tance ), īnādāna ( recovery of debts ) and others. It formed the basis of the Vivādacandra of Misarumisra, the Vivada-cintamani

Besides this digest Candeśvara compiled several other works. 

Kṛtyacintāmaṇi is one of such works. It is a question when it was composed. In his Gșhastharatnakara he says that certain architectural and decorative constructions called Srivksa, Vardha māna and Nandyāvarta have been spoken of by him in the Kr̥tyacintāmaṇi. 1148 But the Kr̥tyacintāmaṇi says that he has already composed the seven ratnakaras1149

The Kștyacintamani is divided into sections called prakāśas. It deals with astronomical matters in relation to the performance of several religious ceremonies and samskāras, such as tārāśuddhi, the intercalary month, garbhādhāna, simantonnayana, birth of a child on the Mula nakṣatra, the rites on the 6th day after birth, nānakarana, the movements of Saturn, Sun's passage from one sign into another, the results of eclipses etc. The Kr̥tyacintāmṇi expressly states that it was composed after all the seven Ratnakaras. The Kstyacintāmaṇi is frequently quoted by Raghu nandana; vide (vol. I) Tithi pp. 21, 36, 44; Sraddhah 282, Jyotistattva pp. 583, 554, 606, Samskāra 920; ( vol.

Another work of Candesvara, the Rajapitiratnakara, was published at Patna (1924 ) by Mr. K. P. Jayasval with a learned introduction dealing with the personal history of Candeśvara, his relations with the Maithila kings and the mediaeval Indian litera ture on politics. It appears that Candeśvara did not contemplate the writing of a work on politics when he compiled his great digest. He wrote the work at the command of the king Bhavesa or ( Bhaveśvara ) of Mithilā.1158 The work contains 16 tarangas ( waves, i. e. chapters ) on the following subjects :- definition of a king, different grades of kings, the eighteen vices or calamities for kings, duties of kings; the characteristics and duties of amatyas (councillors ); the characteristics of purohita; the characteristics and duties of a prādvivāka (Judge); the members of the ball of justice ( sabhyas), their number and qualifications; concerning forts; the time and place and accessories of the settlement of royal policy; concerning the state treasury; the army; the com mander-in-chief and the discipline of the army; ambassadors, allies, and spies; the general obligations of kings, conflict of Dharmaśāstra and Arthasastra, the six gunas-saindhi etc., the mandala of kings; the king's power of punishment; abdication by king, the heir-apparent, impartibility of the kingdom; the eldest son's right to succeed, the seven constituent elements of the state; obligation towards the poor, the helpless etc.; the coronation of the heir-apparent or his investiture.

There are two more works composed by Candeśvara viz., the Dānavākyāvali and the Śivavākyāvali. Vide I. O. Cat. p. 1409, No. 3724 for the latter and Hāraprasad Shastri's Cat. ( 1925) vol. III No. 2393 pp. 465-66 for the Dānavākyāvali. Raghunandana quotes Dānavākyāvali in (vol. II ) Udvāha p. 138 ( which is most probably this work of Candeśvara). 

Candesvara names in his works, particularly in the Kr̥tyarat nakara and the Vivādaratnākara, a host of writers and works. In his great digest he drew largely upon five predecessors and incorporated often without acknowledgment much or almost all that was valuable in them. These five predecessors were the Kamadhenu, the Kalpataru, the Pārijāta, the Prakāśa (i. e. Smsti mahārnava) and Halāyudha, all of which he quotes scores of of times. At the end of the Vivādaratnākara he boasts that what. ever is of the essence in the above five works and even more is comprehended in his single work the Ratnākara,1151 Dr. Jayasval rightly points out (in Intro. to Rājanitiratnākara p. p.) From Lakṣmidhara's Kalpataru on Vyavahāra Candeśvara borrows into his Vivādaratnākara practically the whole book'. The boastful references to bimself and highly slighiing remarks about Kāma dhenu, Kalpataru and other works which occur in his works are felt by modern readers as very objectionable and offensive, since he appropriates without express acknowledgement the valuable parts of such works as the Kamadhenu, Kalpataru and others. 

In several papers Mr. (now Dr.) Bhabatosh Bhattacharya attempts to show Candeśvara's indebtedness to others (vide the following) and also offers some other matters about Candesvara and others : (1) Candesvara's indebtedness to Ballalasena' in 1. C. vol. XI pp. 141-44; (2) Candesvara's indebtedness to Śridatta in N. I. A. (Poona Vol. V No. 2 pp. 36-38 ); (3) The Danasāgara and Danaratnākara' in the Proceedings of the 15th All-India Oriental Conference (Bombay) pp. 281-83; (4) Supplementary portion of Gșhastharatnākara in I. C. vol. XIII pp. 79-84; (5) Candeśvara's own account of himself

and his patron Harisimhadeva inthe Proceedings of All-India Oriental Conference at Tirupati (1940) pp. 171-175. I have to protest against a careless remark of the writer on p. 171 'Though the Gshastharatpakara of Candeśvara was published in 1928 he has not utilized the printed edition, but consulted the incomplete Deccan College Ms. of the same, which has only folios 30, 72–113 and has thus failed to supply the additional information contained in its Introductory verses'.

Here the writer has done an injustice to me. The first volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra' was published at Poona by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in August 1930. It contains 760 pages, the first 466 pages being more important than the rest; the remaining pages contain long lists of the works and authors on Dharmaśāstra. In the first part of 1926 was published by the same Institute the Vyavahāramayukha edited by me (text and exhaustive notes ). That is, the work of writing and seeing through the press the first volume of the H. of Dh. was at the most spread over about four years and a half from 1926. Candeśvara's career and works are dealt with in pp. 366-372. The pages must have been written in the last months of 1927 or the first part of 1928. The press was in Poona and I, who examined three proofs of each form, was in Bombay and this took time. There are several fallacies in Mr. Bhattacharya's remarks. A work in Sans krit published in Calcutta in 1928 may not be known at all elsewhere for years, unless the publisher sends of his own accord copies or advertisements to different parts of India or unless writers cr libraries and learned societies in other provinces place general orders with publishers in Calcutta to send books pub lished by them. The only Library in Bombay in those days that contained a large number of Sanskrit Mss, or printed Sanskrit works was that of the Asiatic Society; but even that Society had and has limited resources, as it was and is a general library and hardly ever placed general orders for Sanskrit works with publishers in other and distant parts of India. There are thou sands of authors and works in Sanskrit on Dharmaśāstra ( as pp. 507-760 of the first volume will indicate). I selected only 113 out of them for treatment in 466 pages and relied on printed works and Mss. available chiefly in Bombay and Poona. I nowhere promised that I would scour all Sanskrit Mss, or printed works in 

B. D,--97

the whole of India and elsewhere. In this particular instance there is nothing to show that the work was even printed when I wrote the pages on Candeśvara or sent them to the Press in Poona. 

Among the authors and works mentioned in his seven ratna karas, those mentioned below deserve to be noted.1153 In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 348 (at p. 356) the learned judges appear to hold that the Pārijāta mentioned in the Vivadacintamani is the Madanapārijata. But this is obviously a mistake (vide pp.655-56 above on Parijata), Besides these in his Rajapitiratnākara he names Kāmandaka, Kullūkabhatta, Pallava and Pallavakāra, Srikara. What is printed as Natasutra in the Vivadaratnakara (p. 477) is really Lata (i.e. Lātyāyana Srautasūtra). Candeśvara mentions many vernacular words (e. g. Krityaratnakara pp. 109, 111, 306, 338, 443). 

We learn a great deal about the family and personal history of Candeśvara from his works. The Vivādaratnākara in the intro duction and in the colophon tells us that Candeśvara was a mantrin (a minister ), was entrusted with the office of minister for peace and war, that he conquered Nepal and weighed himself against gold on the banks of the Vagvati in sake 1236 (1314 A. D.).1153 There are more or less similar colophons at the end of

The कृत्यसमु चय, भूपालपद्धति and भूपालकृत्यसमुच्चय seem to be the same work. The work called Pallava ( on Rajaniti) is frequently men tioned in the Rajanitiratnakara on pp. 35, 41, 52, 53, 72, 84 

and Pallavakāra is mentinend on pp. 18, 79. 1153 श्रीचण्डेश्वरमन्त्रिमा मतिमतानेन प्रसन्नात्मना नेपालाखिलभूमिपालजयिना

the Rajapitiratnakara and the other ratnākaras. The grand-father of Candesvara was Devāditya,1154 who was minister of Hara simbadeva of Tirhut and who belonged to the Kārṇāta family. Two families ruled over Mithila viz, the Kārṇāta dynasty from 1097 A. D. to 1324 A. D. followed by the Kāmeśvara dynasty. The first started with Nānyadeva and ended with Harisimha deva (vide JBORS vol. IX p. 300 ff. and vol. X. p. 37 and JBRS vol. 43 for 1957 pp. 1-6 by Dr. R. C. Majumdar and · Kārnāta rulers of Mithilā' in the same volume pp. 61-63 by Mr. Kamal Narain Jha). Harisimhadeva had to retire before the Delhi Sultan Ghiasuddin Tughlak and established himself in Nepal which happened in December 1324 A. D, as the note from the Pañji historian of Mithilā (vide note 1161 below) shows and ruled there for several years. 

The correct name of the king was Harisimhadeva, though the printed Kr̥tyaratnākara exhibits the name as Harasimhadeva (Intro. verse 4). It would be seen from the genealogy that Vidyāpati, famous for his padas in Maithili, was the son's son of Jayadatta, a first paternal cousin of andesvara. Vidyāpati in his Purusaparikșā, 2nd tale (Subuddhakathā ) narrates the story of Harisiṁhadeva. There is great confusion about the birth-date of Vidyāpati, some saying, that he was born in 1340, while others hold that his birth was in 1380 A. D. or 1390 A. D. Most hold that he died in 1448 A. D. It is unnecessary to give more details about him here. Vide I. A. vol. 14 pp. 182–196 by Dr. Grierson, vol. 28 pp. 57–58; • Poems of Vidyāpati' in Devanāgari by Khagendranath Mitra with a valuable Introduction of 132 pages, reviewed in J, G. J. R. I. Vol. X pp. 175–196. Dr. Jayakant Mishra's History of Maithili Literature' vol. I describes on pp. 130–196 the period 1350-1450 A. D. as the age of Vidyāpati Thakur. Besides his famous lyrical poems in Maithili some Sanskrit works are ascribed to him viz. Varṣakrtya (which Raghuo in Mala in vol. I p. 823 mentions as Vidyāpati's ), Ganga vākyāvali (Raghu vol. I. pp. 39, 79 and 259 mentions a work of this name but its author is not named), Dānavākyāvali (vol. II

Of these Gangavākyāvali, and Śaivasarvasvasāra are attributed to queen Viśvasadevi and Dānavākyāvali to queen Dhiramati. Vide new 1. A. vol. VII pp. 49–57 by G. C. Basu and Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya's paper in the Proceedings of All-India Oriental Conference at Benares (in 1943-44) vol. II. pp. 288-297. The grant of the village Bisapi to Vidyāpati (now held by scholars as spurious) is set out by Grierson on p. 191 of his paper in I. A. vol. 14 pp. 182-196 on * Vidyāpati and his Contemporaries and Grierson in I. A. vol. 28 pp. 57–58 states that the grant is dated in La. Sam. 292 i. e. 1400-1 A. D. i. e. he holds that La. Sam. started in 1109 A. D. (vide above p. 733 for La. Sam.) and he sets out the Kāmesvara dynasty as follows. Pañjikāras mention four rulers after Viśvāsadevi, but as Vidyāpati does not mention them they are omitted here.

pura. There is no unanimity about the chronology of the rulers of the Kārṇāta dynasty. 

The last three of the Kārnāta Dynasty are stated to have been Rāmasimha, Saktisiṁha and Harisimha. But even bere there is a difficult problem. In the Inscription of Pratāpamalla (I. A. vol. IX pp. 184, 188, 189) a king named Bhūpālasimha is shown as liaving ruled between Saktisimha and Harisiṁha. The present author need not deal with that question here. We know from the Kṛtyaratnākaia (2nd Intro. verse quoted in note 1154 )

that Devāditya, the grand-father of Candesvara, was the chief minister of the king. After Devāditya his son Vireśvara became chief minister and Candeśvara, the eldest son of Vireśvara, held several offices such as chief justice, also minister for peace and war and chief minister ( vide note from Mitra's Notices vol. VI p. 67). As Candeśvara weighed himself against precious metals in sake 1236 (1314 A. D.), it follows that he must have been for at least several years a favourite minister of the king Harisimbadeva, to whom the Pañji historians of Mithila assign a reign of 20 years i. e. Harisimhadeva began to rule about 1304 A. D. Harisimha deva, being defeated, went to Nepal and the Delhi emperor put in his place Kāmesvara Rajapandita.1155 One of the sons of Devāditya was Vireśvara who was also a minister for peace and war of the same king and is said to have made grants to learned Brāhmaṇas in Rāmapura (i. e. Simraon in Champaran District) and other cities (verse 10 of Kștyaratnākara). Mr. Jayasval points out in his introduction to the Rājaniti-ratnākara (i) that the correct name of the king was Harisiṁhadeva. Another son of Devāditya was Ganesvara who was younger than Vire svara and who was also a great minister and author of Suga tisopāna. A copy of this work bears the date La-sam (Laksmanasena era) 224 (i, e. 1343–44 A. D. ).1158 In the colophop of this work Devāditya is called 'mabāmatta' (mahāmātra ) and Ganesvara is styled mahārājādhirāja. In the Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara the Sugatisopana is said to be the work of one who was pratihastaka (deputy) of Bhavaśarma 187 Candesvara was the son of Vireśvara and like his father and grandfather became minister of Harisjidhadeva. This must have happened about 1310 A. D., as he weighed himself in 1314 A. D. The Kștyaratnākara (verse 15) says that he touched the very idol of Pasupati in Nepal and worshipped it after conquering the country.

From the Vyavahāraratnākara it appears that Candesvara was Chief Judge as well as Minister for peace and war.1188 Candesvara and his ancestors are highly praised for their libe rality1159 In the Dānaratnākara (verse 2 at the end) he is said to have rescued the earth submerged in the flood of Mlecchas. 1180 This probably refers to the defeat of some Mahomedan generals. Harisimhadeva was routed by Ghiasuddin Tughlak in 1324 and retired from Tirhut into 1181 Nepal. Hence it follows that the seven

Ratnakaras, some of which (like vivāda and dāna) refer to his weighing himself against gold in 1314 A. D. and his high position at the court of Harisiṁhadeva, were composed between 1314 and 1324 A. D. His Rājanitiratnakara was composed at the command of Bhaveśa. This last belonged to the line of the Kameśvara dynasty which began to rule Tirhut in the third quarter of the 13th century, in 1370 A. D. according to Mr. Jayasval (introduc tion to Rajanitiratnakara, r). Therefore the literary activities of Caṇdeśvara extended over about 50 years from 1314 and the Rajaniti-ratnākara was probably his last work composed at a very advanced age. For the somewhat controversial and confused chropology of the Tirhut kings of the Kārṇāta and Kameśvara dynasties, vide Hp. cat. (Introduction p. 31 ); Grierson in Ind. Ant, vol. 14, pp. 182–196 and Ind. Ant. vol. 28, p. 57; JASB 1915 pp. 407-433 (M. M. Chakravarti); JBORS vol. IX, p. 300 and X, p. 37 (Jayasval). 

Candeśvara exercised very great influence over Maithila and Bengal writers. Misarumiśra, Vardhamana, Vācaspati-miśra and Raghunandanal162 very frequently quote him. The Viramitrodaya (p. 181 ) calls the Ratnākara 'Paurastya-nibandha' (eastern digest ).
