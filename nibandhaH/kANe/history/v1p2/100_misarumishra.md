100. Misarumiśra 

Misarumiśra is famous for his works called Vivādacandra and Padārtha-candrikā (on the Nyāya-Vaiseșika system ). There is a ms, of the Vivādacandra in the Deccan College (No. 57 of 1883-84). That work deals with the titles of Law (vyavahāra padas ) such as ļṇādāna (recovery of debt), nyāsa (deposit), asvāmivikraya, sambhūya-samutthana (partnership), dāyavibhāga, stridhana; and then with procedure, viz. the plaint, reply, pramānas, witnesses, possession etc. It frequently quotes the Ratnākara ( on vivāda and vyavahāra ) of Candeśvara and several times criticizes him. Besides numerous smṛti writers the other authors and works named are : Parijāta, Prakāśa, Bālarūpa (often ), Bhavadeva and Smstisāra ( frequently ).

In the mss, and colophons the name of the author seems to be Misarūmiśra.1972 He tells us that he wrote the work under the orders of princess Lachimadevi, wife of prince Candrasimha who appears to have been the younger brother of Bhairavasimhadeva of the Kāmeśvara dynasty of Mithilā. The work was probably called Vivādacandra to connect it with the prince Candrasimha. The Vivādacandra first1273 speaks of king Bhavesa of the Kāme svara dynasty, then of his son Hariṣimhadeva, then of his son Darpanārāyana and the latter's queen Hirā or Dhira and then of Candrasimha and his queen Lakhimā or Lachimā. We saw above that Candeśvara who had weighed himself against gold in 1314 A. D. wrote in his old age under Bhavesa his work on Rājaniti. Lachimadevi was queen of the great-grandson of this Bhaveśa, who became king of Tirhut in the third quarter of the 14th century. Therefore Candrasiṁha must have flourished about the middle of the 15th century and Misarumiśra's work must be assigned to that period. M. M. Chakravarti points out (JASB for 1915, p. 425) that for Dhirasimha, a son of Darpanārāyaṇa, there is an authentic date, viz, 321 of the Lakṣmaṇasena era in Tirhut (i. e. 1438 A. D. ), when a ms. of Srinivasa's Setudarpaṇi (com. on Setubandha) was copied during Dhirasimha's reign. It appears that Misarumiśra was closely related to Lakhimādevi, who was the daughter of Misarumisra's sister, 

That the Vivādacandra is a work of authority on Hindu Law in Mithilā has been recognised from very early days in the British courts,1274 The Vivādacandra held that the word stridhana was to be applied to such woman's property as was technically
