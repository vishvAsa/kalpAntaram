CHAPTER XXIV 

MINOR GRHYA AND OTHER RITES 

The grhyasūtras speak of certain other rites performed on certain fixed days in the year. Most of them have ceased to be performed in modern times, though vestiges of some of them appear even now. Gautama (VIII. 19 ) enumerates the seven pākayajā asamsthās among his forty sarskāras. Out of these seven pākayajñas, aṣtakā, pārvana and śrāddha will be dealt with under śrāddha later on, The seven haviryajñas and the seven somasamsthās will be treated of in the note on Srauta. A fow of the other rites are briefly described below. 

Pārvana sthalipāka:-Among the seven pākayājñasamsthās mentioned by Gaut. (VIII.19) is the pārvang sthālipaka. When a person is married and returns to his house after marriage he causes the newly married bride to sacrifice & mess of cooked food. The wife husks the rice grains of which that sthalipāka is prepared. She cooks the mess, sprinkles ajya on it, takes it from the fire. Then he sacrifices to the deities of the Vedic Darsa-Pūrpamāsa and then to Agni Svistakrt. With the remnants of the cooked food he feeds a learned brāhmana and makes the present of a bull to that brābmana. From that time the householder constantly saorifices on the days of the full moon and of the new moon & similar mess of cooked food sacred to Agni. In the case of one who has not kindled the three Vedic fires, the sthalipāka is meant for Agni (it is Āgnoya). In the case of an householder who keeps the three Vedic fires the sthallpāka at Full moon is Agnisomniya and Aindra or Mahendra or Aindrāgna on the New moon day ( Khādira gr. II. %. 1-3, Aśv. Śr. I. 3. 8-12). Both the householder and his wife fast on the days of the full and new moon or they eat only 

once in the morning on those days (Ap. Dh. S. II. 1. 1. 4-5, Aøv. g$. I. 10. 2). This is briefly the pārvaṇa sthalipāka. It is begun on the first full moon day after marriage and is conti. nued throughout the lives of the husband and wife. In the sthalipākas performed throughout life on the full moon and new moon there is no dakṣiṇā ( of a bull). 1838 Vide for details

Caitri :. According to Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 19 the caitri rite is the same as sūlagava, known as Iśanabali to the students of the Apastamba sūtra (Ap. gr. 19, 13 ff.) and this rite called Caitrl was performed on the full moon day of the month of Caitra. In the Sān. gr. IV. 19 it is said that this rite takes place on the full moon day of Caitra and there is a brief des cription of it which is rather obscure ( vide S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 132 ). The Vaik. IV. 8 describes it as follows: On the full moon day of Caitra the house is cleaned and decorated ; the husband and wife deck themselves in new garments ( lower and upper) and with flowers etc.; after two āghāras 1940 are made in fire and rice is cooked in a vessel for the deities, offerings are made of clarified butter, with the mantras 'grismo hemanta' (Tai. S. V.7. 2. 4 ) 'ūrṇam me pūryatām,' 'sriye jātaḥ'( Rg. IX. 94. 4 ),' Vaiṣṇavam' (Tai, S. I. 2, 13, 3 ) and having offered oblations of boiled rice mixed with ghee to Madhu, 1941 Madhava, Sukra, Suci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, Urja, Sabas, Sahasya, Tapas, Tapasya, to the deities of Rtus, to herbs, to the lords of herbs, to Sri ( goddess of wealth), to the lord of Sri, to Viṣṇu ; having worshipped to the west of the fire the goddess Srl and the god Sripati whose face is turned eastwarde, he announces the havis (sacrificial food ) and having served to the recitation of the bymn to anna ( food ) the brāhmaṇas with cooked cuitrya food he should himself eat in the company of his sapiṇdas. 

Sitāyajña ( sacrifice to ploughed land) - In the Gobbila gr. IV. 4. 27 there1848 is a brief desoription of the sacrifice performed at the time of ploughing by one who kept the smārta or aupasana fire: 'on an auspioious constellation he should cook & mess of sacrificial food and should offer oblations to the following deities, viz. Indra, Maruts, Parjanya (rains), Aśani ( thunder bolt ), Bbaga. And he should also offer (olarified butter ) to Sita, Aśā, Aradā, Anaghā.' In Pār. gr. II. 17 this rite is des

oribed in greater detail. But for want of space it is not set out here. The Pār. gr. in II. 13 speaks of a different rite to be performed at the time of taking out the plough and using it for ploughing. 

Śrāvaṇi or Śravaṇākarma and Sarpabali :--Aśv. gr. II. 1.1-15, Pār. gp. II. 14, Gobhila gr. III. 7. 1-23, Sān. gß.IV. 15, Bhār. gr. II. 1, Ap. gr. 18, 5-12 and others describe these two rites which are performed on the full moon day of Srāvana, wbether the moon be in conjunction with the constellation of Śravaṇa or not. Aśv. gr, describes it as follows: 1943 "Having filled a new jar with the flour of unbroken grains of barley he places it on a new sikya ( an arrangement of strings for holding pots etc.) along with & spoon for making offerings (bali). Having got ready fried barley grains he smears 1944 half of them with clarified butter. At sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food and & cake on one potsherd and offers oblations (of cooked food) with the four verses 'O Agnil lead us to wealth by a good path &c.' ( Rg. I. 189. 1-4 ) verse by verse and offers with one band the cake prepared on one potsherd with the mantra 'to the constant one, the Earth demon, svābā." The cake should have been completely submerged in clarified butter or its top may be visible; with the verse - Agni, do not hand us over to ovil' (Rg.1.189.5) he sacrifices over the entire cake the clarified butter in which the cake had been submerged. Reciting the verse 'may the steeds bring bliss to us in our invocationa' ( Rg. VII. 38.7) he sacrifices into the fire the fried grains with his joined hands."945 He should give the other ( not smeared with olarified butter) fried grains to his people (sons &c.). Out of the jar he fills the spoon with barley flour, goes out of the house with his face towards the east, pours down water on a pure spot and offers sacrifice with the mantra to the divine 1946 hosts of snakes,

svaba' and makes an obeisance to them with joined hands in the words the serpents that are terrestrial,1947 that are aerial, that are celestial, that dwell in the several directions--to them I have brought this bali; to them I make ready this bali. Having gone round the bali with the right hand turned towards it, he sits down to the west of the bali (and recites the mantra ) * thou art & serpent; thou art the lord of serpents that creep ; by food thou protectest men and by a cake the serpents, by sacrifice the gods, me who am in thee (i. e. who seek thy favour and protection ) may not the serpents who also are in thee do any harm; I give over the Dhruva ( spoon) to thee.' Then with the words ' O firm one, I give over this one, this one to thee' he gives his people (son, unmarried daughter, wife) one by one. With the words ' O firm one, I give myself over to thee' he gives himself over at the end. Let no one pass between the sacrificer (and the bali) up till the rite of giving in charge ( paridana ). 1948 'To the divine hosts of serpents svāha '-with these words let him offer & bali in the evening and in the morning till Pratyavarobaṇa. Some count the days till Pratyavarohana 1949 (from Srāvana full moon ) and offer the same number of balis on that very day (on which the śravaṇā rite takes place)." The San. gr. IV. 15 has a similar ceremony called Sravaṇākarma; however it practically con tains nothing beyond rules about the bali to serpents and it is worthy of note that some of the 16 upacāras associated with honouring a guest and with devapūjā are employed ( in it and in Ap. gr. &c.) for honouring the serpents viz. Offering a comb, unguents, flowers, thread ( vastra), collyrium, mirror. The Pār. gr. II. 14 is more elaborate as to sarpabali and the deities to whom the oblations of cooked food are offered are. Viṣṇu, Śravaṇa (nakṣatra), the Full moon day of Srāvana and the rainy season.' In Par. gr. also, & comb, ointment, collyrium, garlands are offered to the serpents. Ap. gr. 18. 5-12, Hir. gr.

Bhār. gr. II. 1, Baud. gr. III. 10, Mānava gr. II. 16 and others contain similar elaborate rules about sarpabali, the Hir. gr. and Ap. gr. requiring that the flowers used should be of the kimśula tree. It appears that when the husband was absent the wife was to offer the bali during the four months. The Mānava gr. II. 16.6 adds that even the sūdra wife of a brāhmaṇa abould silently offer the bali after washing her hands. Vide Sān. gr. IV. 15. 20 also for the wife doing it silently. 

Serpent worship arose from the fears entertained about the deadly effects of snake bites. The serpent cult is very ancient as the quotation from the Tai. S. cited above shows. Vide also Atharvaveda VIII.7.23 and XI. 9.16 and 24. In the Atharvaveda (VIII. 14.14-16) the well known names of some mythical serpents viz. Takṣaka, Dhstarāstra and Airāvata oocur. The dangers from snakes must have intensified in the rainy season when serpents sought shelter in human babitations owing to vast areas being flooded and in search of their prey, viz. mice and frogs &c. Therefore the rite of offering & bali to serpents was performed on the full moon day of Srāvana and a bali was offered every day to serpents for four months till the full moon of Mārgasirṣa on which day took place the Pratyavarobaṇa (re-descent) i. e. discarding the use of cots for sleeping on and using the ground for that purpose. Fergusson in his famous work Tree and Serpent worship' (1868) traces serpent worship in the nations of antiquity, such as in Egypt, Judes, Greece &c. In the Mahabbārata nāgas figure very frequently. Vide Ādi. 35 and 123. 71, Udyoga 103, 9-16; Anusāsana 150. 41 (where the names of seven nāgas that support the earth such as Vāsuki, Ananta &c. are specified). In Anuśāsana 14. 55 Śiva is said to have snakes on his body like yajñopavīta. The purāṇas are full of the stories of nāgas. Serpent worship continues to this day partioularly in South India, but now serpents are worship ped on the 5th of the bright half of Srāvana instead of on the full moon day of Srāvana as in the times of the sūtras. This day is now called Nagapancami and some account of it will be given later on under vratas. India possesses more varieties of serpents tban any single country in the world and the toll of life taken by snake bites is very heavy as compared with any other country. 

In certain medieval digests like the Samgkāra-kaustubha (p. 122) a rite called Nāgabali is described. It is performed on Sinivall(& day on which the moon is seen, but there is amāvāsya 

824 





thereafter) or full moon day or on the 5th or on the 9th when the moon is in Aśleṣā (of which serpents are the presiding deity). Its object is two-fold viz. to expiate the sin of having killed & snake or snakes and to remove the obstacle to progeny ( supposed to arise from the wrath of serpents killed by a person). In this & figure of a serpent is made of the flour of rice or wheat or sesame which is then placed in a sūrpa (winnowing basket), then it is worshipped with the 16 upacāras (described above ) and a bali of pāyaga (rice-milk) is offered to it; then after washing the hands and feet and sipping water & homa is performed with ordinary fire (but there is no svistakrt offering); an oblation of clarified butter is offered with om and all the three vyābśtis into the mouth of the serpent figure and the rest of the ūjya is sprinkled on its body, the serpent is praised with the mantras quoted above from Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3 and certain Purāṇa verses are repeated and the figure is thrown into the fire; then impurity (āsauca) is observed by the sacrificer and his wife for three days or one day; then eight brāhmaṇas are invited, they are supposed to stand in the place of the burnt effigy and upacāras are offered to them, they are fed and gifts are given to them; then a golden image of & serpent is put into the kalasa (water-pot ) and prayer is offered to it, and the golden image or its value or a cow is gifted to a brāhmaṇa. 

The Pār. gr. (II. 15) describes a rite called Indrayajāa on the full moon day of Proṣthapada ( i. e. Bhadrapada ). It is briefly as follows: Having cooked pāyasa (rice cooked in milk) for Indra 1950 and cakes and having placed ( four ) cakes round the fire, and having offered the two ājyabhāgas he offers the milk rice to Indra; he offers the ājya oblations to Indra, Indrāni ( Indra's wife), Aja Ekapād, Abirbudhnya and to the Prosthapadās; he offers milk-rice to Indra ; after he has eaten ( a portion of the sacrificial food ) he offers a bali to the Maruts ; for Sruti says (Śat. Br. IV.5. 2. 16 ) 'the maruts are the eaters of ahuta ';195the bali ( to Maruts ) is offered on leaves of the

The Kausika sūtra ( 140 ) describes the procedure of a festival in honour of Indra for kings. It is begun on the eighth day in the bright half of Bhadrapada or Asvina in which a banner is raised on Śravaṇa nakṣatra. Yāj. I. 147 declares a holiday for one day on the day on which the banner in honour of Indra is raised and when it is taken down. Aparārka (p. 190 ) quotes Garga to the effect that the banner is raised by the king on the 12th of the bright half of Bhadrapada when the moon is in conjunction either with Uttarāṣadhā, Śravaṇa or Dhaniṣthā and adds that it is taken down on the Bharaṇī nakṣatra after the full moon day of Bhadrapada. The Kr̥tya ratnākara ( pp. 292-93 ) adds that during the days of the festival worship is offered to figures of Indra and his wife Saci and son Jayanta made from pieces of sugarcane stalks and that it is not raised on Saturday or Tuesday or in periods of impurity due to birth or mourning or in portents like an earth-quake.

Indramaha ) was started by Uparicara Vasu. It is stated there in that when that king was prevailed upon by Indrs to desist from being a hermit in a forest and to rule over the country called Cedi, Indra gave him a bamboo staff as an affectionate gift and in honour of Indra the king planted it in the earth and since that time when the year ended a bamboo staff was raised by kings (and also other humbler persons ) and next day it was decked with baskets full of fragrant substances and ornaments, and garlands were suspended from it. It is possible that the raising of a bamboo staff on the first day of Caitre every year in the Decoan and other places is reminiscent of this ancient festival in honour of Indra. The Bṭbateamhita (chap. 43) describes the origin of the Indramaha festival and devotes over sixty verses to the elucidation of the method of celebrating it. Viṣṇu gave to Indra & flag-staff to frighten asuras; in verse 8 it refers to Uparioara Vasu as the originator of the Indra festival, states on what auspicious conjunctions & carpenter and an astrologer should go to a forest and gives directions as to the tree to be selected ( Arjuna tree being the best ); then the tree is to be felled the next day and brought to the capital by the king on the eighth of the bright half of Bhradra pada with a retinue of citizens, ministers and brābmanas; the oity should be decorated with fine patakas ( flags ) and toranas (festival arches ); on the 11th there was to be a vigil, the trunk of the tree should be pared and chiselled and it should be placed on a yantra ( a mechanioal contrivance to raise it up), homa is to be offered; then it is to be raised up erect on the 12th of the bright half of Bhadrapada when the moon is in Śravaṇa nakṣatra or even without that being so; five or seven wooden figures (called sakrakumaris ) are also to be placed noar it ( to enhanoe the charm of the staff) and two smaller staffs (one and the other of the length of the principal staff) are also to be raised called Nanda and Upananda ; another staff also is to be raised as Indra's mother; the staff was to be deoked with several ornaments, baskets were to be hung round the staff, each one above the other and smaller in size, on the 4th day (from 12th tithi) verses in praise are to be recited and on the 5th day ( from the 12th i. e. on 1st of the dark half ) the staff is to be bidden farewell to.

The Asv. gs. II. 2. 1-3 describes 194 the rite as follows: 'on the full moon day of Āśvayuja (i, e. Aśvina ) the Aśrayuji rite (is performed ). Having adorned the house, baving bathed and put on clean ( White ) garments, they should take out a mess of oooked food for Pasupati and should offer it with the formula 'to Pasupati, to Sive, to Samkara, to Prṣātaka, svāba." He should sacrifice with his joined bands & mixture of milk and clarified butter with the formula 'may what is deficient in me be made complete ( or full); may what is complete not deterion rate in me. To Prṣataka, svābā.' 

The Sān. gr. (IV. 16 ) requires that in this rite oblations of olarified butter should be offered to Asvins, to the two stars of Aśrayuj nakṣatra, to the full moon of Āśvina; to Sarad (autumn) and to Pasupati and the mixture of milk and ājya is offered with the hymn Rg. VI. 28 ( ā gavo agman) and that on that night the calves are allowed to join their mothers. Pār. gs. II. 16 calls this rite Prṣātakāḥ, but it prescribes the cooking of pāyasa (milk-rice ) for Indra and offerings of that mixture with curds, honey and ghee are made to Indra, Indrāni, the Asvins, to the full moon of Asvina and Sarad (autumn). The Gobhila gr. III. 8. 1 also calls this rite Prṣātaka and it adds the tying to the arms &o. of amulets made of lac together with all sorts of herbs for the sake of prosperity. Vide also Khādira g!. III. 3. 1-5, Vaik. IV.9 for this rite. 

In most of the grhyasūtras another rite called Agrayana is described immediately after Aśrayuji. Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 19 explains that in the Aśrayuji rite mentioned by Gaut. both the Asvayuji described above from Aśv. gr. and Agrayana are included. Agrayana is also called 'Navayajña' in Gobhila smrti ( in verse III. 103 ) and Navasasyeṣti in Manu IV. 27.

The word 'ni-rupya' means that on the moss of cooked food, the two operations of nirvapa (taking out a por tion from the whole with the mantra पशुपतये वा शुष्ट निर्षपामि)and proksana are to be performed and that the rest of the mess is to be eaten by the g&orifioer and his family. a means milk mixed with clarified buttor'.

Agrayana iṣti is prescribed in the Aøv, srauta sūtra II. 9 and other brauta sūtras for those who have consecrated the three vedio fires ( i.e. abitāgnis ). According to Nāra. yapa an āhitāgni is to perform this āgreyaṇa sacrifice of fresh corn according to the frauta sūtra, but in case of difficulties he may do so in accordance with Asv. gr. II. 2. 4 in the Tretā fires and that one who has not conge orated the three fires may offer the sacrifice in the sala ( i. e. aupāgana ) fire. This āgrayana rite is required even by the srauta sūtra as to crops of rice, barley and syāmāka 1955 only and no one was to make use of fresh corn of these three kinds without offering this sacrifice, but there was no restriction as to the use of other kinds of corn or as to vege tables &c. The word Agrayana is explained as 1950 that rite in which fresh fruits are first offered to gode' or 'that rite in which fresh corn is first offered or eaten'. The deities of the srauta Agrayapa are three, viz. Indrāgni (or AgoIndrau), Visvedevas, Dyāyāprthivi (heaven and earth), but in the gphya Āgrayana, Agni Svistakst is added as the fourth (San. gf. III. 8. 1, Ap. gr. 19.7). Āśy. gr.

This rite is also described in San, gļ. III. 8, Pār, gr. III. 1, Gobhlla gr. III. 8. 9-24, Khādira gr. III. 3. 6-15, Vaik. IV. 2, Mānava gr. II. 3. 9-14 &c. 

There is one peculiarity in Vaik. viz. that it connects the Pit?s also with this rite. According to Mānava gr. the Agra yana is porformed on a parva day in Vasanta (spring) with fresh barley that is (then) harvested and with rice in sarad (autumn). 

Vaik. VI. 19 prescribes the prāyascitta of pādakrcchra or a fast for using first fruits without performing Agrayaṇa rite. 

In modern times some vestige of this Navayajña (saorifice of first fruits) still remains. The full moon day of Asyina is still called in the Deccan 'navyāci paurṇimā' and a few ears of growing crops are picked up, are woven with flowers and tastefully arranged and the whole is suspended from the entrance door or its lintel. 

Agrahāyaṇī ---This is one of the seven pākayajñas men tioned by Gautama (VIII. 19 ) among his forty saṇskāras. 

The full moon day of Mārgaśirṣa is called Agrahāyani; the rite 1958 performed on that day is also called by the same name on account of association with it. Pratyavarohana is a rite performed to signalise the giving up of the use of cots and high couches, recommended from the full moon of Srāvana for fear of snakes (as in Sān. gr. IV. 15. 22). Some describe two rites separately, one on the full moon day of Mārgasirṣa and another oalled Pratyavarohana on the first night of Hemanta (vide Ap. gr. 19.3-5 and 8-12). There is some divergence as to the time and the exact procedure of this rite. Some (like. Aśv. gr. II. 3.1-2) hold that it may be performed on the 14th day of the bright

half or the full moon day of Mārgasirsa. Others restriot it to the full moon day. Very elaborate descriptions are given in Pār. gp. III. 2, Gobbila gr. III. 9. 1-23. As this rite has entirely gone out of vogus a brief description from the Asy, gf. alone is appended 1989 here. “Having again (after Aśvaguji ) renovated the house with plaster (of paint or cow-dung) and by levelling ( the floor), they should offer after sunset oblations of pāyasa (milk-rice) with the mantras 'strike aside,'*60 O white one. with thy foot, with the front and back portions of the foot these seven women ( daughters ) of Varuna and all (females ) that belong to the tribes of the king ( of serpents ). Inside the house of the white one the serpent did not kill any thing, adoration to the white one, the son of Vidarva, svāha.' Here no oblation is offered to (Agni) Sviṣtakrt. While gazing fixedly at the fire he repeate in a low voice 'may there be no harm to us from the progeny 1901 of Prajāpati.' He should think in his mind of Hemanta (winter) saying 'be suspicious and well-disposed towards us.' To the west of the fire a well-spread layer of grass should be prepared; he should sit down on it and having recited in a low voice 'Be blissful, O Earth' (Rg. I. 22. 15 ) he should lie down on that layer with his people (sons &c.) with the head towards the east and face turned towards the north. The others may lie down according as space permits or each should lie down one after another, the elder one before the one next to him in years. Those (of the sacrificer's sons &o.) who know the mantras should murmur them (Rg. I. 22. 15 and the mantras referred to in sūtra 12 below). Getting up from the layer they should three times recite the mantra' from that place may the gods protect us '(Rg. I. 22. 16 ); the same verse ( they should repeat) a fourth time turning their faces to the south, to the west and the north.1968 Having gathered together they should

repeat in a low tone the mantras sacred to the sun and the Svastyayana 1883 mantras, cook food and feed the brāhmaṇas and make the latter pronounce suspicious words." In the Pāli work called Anguttara-nikāya there is & section called Paccoro. hanivagga in which the Pratyavarohana observed by brāhmaṇas is described. Vide Anguttara vol. V. ( ed. by Hardy ) p. 233 OXIX, and Z. D. M. G. vol. 52 pp. 149-151. 

Agrahāyani has been described also in Khādira gr. III. 3. 1-26, Gobhila gr. III. 9, Mānava gr. II. 7.1-5, Bhār. gr. II. %, Ap. gf. 19. 3-5, Kāthaka gļ. 60.1 ff., Kausika sūtra 24. 24-36 Hir. gļ. II. 17. 1 ( where Mātrdatta says that Agrahāyani is also styled Pratyavarohana). Baud. gp. II. 10 speaks of a rite called Pratyavarohana to be performed at the beginning of each of the six ftus (seasons) and the intercalary month (if any). 

This is a different rite. 

sulagava or Īsānabali - This was originally an offering of the flesh of an ox to Śiva. There was some difference of opinion as to the time. Aśv. gr. IV. 9.2 states that it was to be perform ed in Sarad ( autumn ) or in Vasanta (spring) under the constel lation of Ardrā. The Baud. gr. II. 7. 1-3 says that every year it was to be performed on the full moon day of Mārgasirsa or on the Ardrā nakṣatra 1964 in that month or whenever cattle suffer from some pest or disease. The Kathaka gr. (52,2-3) declares that the Sūlagave may be performed from various desires in śarad or vasanta and that according to some ācāryas there is no restriction as to season. The Bhār. gr. IL 8 and Hir. 87. II. 8. 2 say that it may be performed in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious nakṣatra. 

Various explanations are given why this rite was called Salagava. Nārāyaṇalsts says Sūla here means one who has & 

1963. According to Nārāyana Rg. X. 158., Rg. I. 50. 1-9, I. 116, 1, and X. 37. 1 are called Sourya verges; while remata are the verbot that contain the word svasti or a benediction, viz. Rg. I. 89. 1, V. 51. 11, X. 63. 1. Narūyapa follows Aśv. Śr. Sutra VI. 6. 18 as to Saurys bymns ; but it is doubtful whether he is right as to the syastyayana Verso8. According to the Bpbad-devat& VIII. 77, Rg. X. 178 is . Syastysyana hymn.

spit ( or pointed rod ) i. e. Śiva who is called Sulin and that this sacrifice is offered to Rudra Śūlin with the ox as a sacrificial animal. Haradatta explains that here the ox is marked with the rod ( of Śiva ). 

This rite is most elaborately described in Asvi gr. IV. 9, Baud. gr. II. 7, Hir. gr. II. 8-9, Bhār. gr. II. 8-10, Pār. gr. III. 8. It appears that even in the times of the grhya sūtras there were many who did not like the rite of ox-flesh. The Baud. gr. (II. 7. 26–27) says196 that if a person cannot secure an ox he may sacrifice with a goat or ram or he may cook & mess of cooked food for Isāna and with that he does everything that is to be done by means of an ox. The commentator Devapāla on Kathaka 1967 gr. 52. 1 says that only a goat is offered and the bull is let off as the people are opposed to the idea of the sacrifice of an ox. 

As this rite has totally gone out of practice only a brief description of it from the Mānaya gļhya1988 ( which is the briefest of all on this rite ) is given here. 'Sulagava is to be performed in Sarad for ( propitiating ) Rudra. In the north-east of the village and not near it ( it is to be performed ) at night and there is to be a sacrificial post, not chiselled ( into an octagonal shape as in other sacrifices ), in the midst of oxen. Before the (final offering ) to Agni Sviṣtakrt (i.e. after perform ing the usual homa with boiled rice up to this point ) he should fill eight vessels made of leaves with blood and offer them in the principal quarters and the intermediate quarters with the eight anuvākas (Tai. S. IV.5.1 ff. and Vāj. S. 16th adhyāya ) beginning with 'adoration to thee, O Rudra, who are Manyu (wrath ).' He should not bring the uncooked offerings into the village. He should bury into the ground the rest ( of the animal offered ) and its skin also. Some cāryas say that in the pakayajñas in which animals are sacrificed there is no saori ficial post.'

Vūstu.pratiṣthā:-- construotion and occupation of a new house ). 

The Asv. gr. II. 7-9, ān. gr. III. 2-4, Pār. gr. III. 4, Ap. gr. 17. 1-13, Khādira gṛ. IV.2.6-22 and other gļhya works deal with the matter of building a new house. Aśv. gr. (II. 7) says that one who intends to build a house should first examine the ground, which must be non-salinous, which should have herbs and trees, much kuś& and viraṇa grass growing on it; that one should dig out thorny plants and plants having milky juice with their roots and remove them and also certain other plants like apāmārga, tilvaka, etc. He should select a spot where the waters coming together from all sides to the centre of it flow round the resting place having the latter on their right side and then are discharged off to the east without noise. Such a spot possesses all auspicious qualities. He should ( Aśv. gr. II.8) also dig a pit knee-deep in the ground to be examined and then fill the pit again with the earth taken out. If the earth taken out fills the entire pit and some earth remains, then the plot is excellent for building a house on; if all the earth dug out just fills the pit, it is of middle quality ; if the earth is not enough to fill the pit the plot is to be rejected. Another method is to fill the pit with water and leave it there through the night. If in the morning there is water in the pit the ground is excellent; if it is moist only, the ground is of middle quality; if it is found dry in the morning the plot is to be rejected. The three dvijātis should respectively select white, red and yellow ground as a site for their house. The plot should be square or rootangular and the owner should draw a thousand furrows on it. With a sami or udumbara branch be sprinkles the ground with water, going thrice round it with his right hand towards it and recites the Santātiya hymn. 1909 He does this thrice pouring out water without interruption with the three verses 'apo hi ṣtha' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). Under the divisions of the bamboo which rests on the chief posts he should have the single rooms constructed. Into the pits in which the posts are to stand he should have an avakū and the water plant called sipalā put down. Having put the plant into the pit in which the middle post is to stand he should spread on it east-ward pointed and north-ward pointed kusa grass and should sprinkle 

1969. This is Rg. VII. 35. 1-16 in which all verses (except 14 and 15) codamonco with the word "samn' and also have tho same word soyoral times.

on the kuśas water into which rice and barley have been thrown with the words to the steady one, the earth demon, svāba." He should when the middle post is being erected repeat over it the two vorges *stand here &c.' and 'to thee the young child may come &o.' Over the bamboo staff when it is placed on the middle post he recites the hemistich rightly ascend the post &o.' On four stones on which dūrvā grass has been spread he should establish the water barrel with the words arise on the earth'or with the verge 'the arangara sounds &c.' He then should pour water into it with the verse 'hither may king Varuṇa come &c.' He then appeases it as follows: he puts gold into water in which rice and barley have been put and with that water he sprinkles it three times, going round it with his right turned towards it with the Santātiya hymn. This he does three times pouring water without interruption with the three verses apo bi ṣtha' (Rg. X. 9.1-3). In the middle of the house he should cook a mess of food, sacrifice from it with the four verses ' Vastoṇpate prati'( Rg. VII. 54. 1-3 and VII. 55. 1) verse by verse, 1990 should cook food which should be given to the brāhmaṇas to eat, whom he should cause to say "lucky is the ground.' 

The Matsyapurāṇa (chap, 252-257 ) deals at length with Vāstusastra, the construction of a house of various dimensions, its posts, the timber to be employed, the rites to be performed when laying the foundation and at later stages, the rite for Vastuśānti ( propitiatory rite for averting evil ). 

The Matsyapurāṇa 1971 (256. 10-11) states that a vāstu yajña has to be performed five times in relation to a house, viz. when laying down the foundation (lit. using the measuring line), when fixing the first post, when raising the first door frame, when entering the house (grhapraveśa) and when vāstu santi is to be performed (for averting evil or on seeing portents). It briefly describes Vāstuyajia as follows (chap. 256. 5-9): On an auspicious day and moment, the stone should be laid over jewels and all seeds; similarly the post is to be worshipped at the hands of four brāhmaṇae; the priest who should wear 

1970. The hymn Rg. VII, 54 bes only three verses but four obla tions are directed. Therefore the 4th oblation is to be offered with Rg. VII. 55. 1 which also is addressed to Vastofpati.

white garments should be master of the Veda and should be accompanied by the artizans, should fix the post that is washed with water mixed with all herbs (or herbs called sarvauṣadhi) and covered with many whole rice and decked with clothes and ornaments to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras and the tunes of auspicious musio; he should perform a home with honey and clarified butter and should repeat the mantra 'vāstow spate prati' (Rg. VII. 54. 1); then the owner should feed brāb manas with a dish of rice-milk. The Matsyapurāṇa notes that the foundation should be laid in the north-east corner and the first post fixed in the south-east. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 268) decribes the procedure of Vāstuśānti and remarks ( verses 33-35) that it should be performed when beginning the construction of a temple or a house or a publio park or when entering a town or one's house for the first time for averting all evil and it should also be performed every year in one's house. In that rite he should make the brāhmaṇas repeat the Raksogona hymn and a hymn to Pavamana Soma (one from Rg. IX. or IX. 1). 

In modern times the ceremony of entering a newly built house is an important one, is an extensive affair and marked by great éclat. A very auspicious day is required for this ceremony and numerous astrological considerations enter into the choosing of a proper day. The ceremony of an entrance is preceded on the same day or on the previous day by a vastuśānti (propitiatory rite) of which grahamakha (a rite for propitiating the planets ) forms a part and the usual rites of worship of Ganess and the like ( mentioned at pp. 213-218) have also to be performed. A few salient features are mentioned here. A mandala is drawn divided into 81 squares, 62 devatās are invoked to be present in the mandala, then a homa is offered to the nine planets with 28 oblations of fuel stioks, sesame and ājys to each planet and oblations are offered to other deities, the performer and his wife have holy water sprinkled over their heads from auspicious jars, the house is surrounded thrice with thread beginning from the east to the accompaniment of Rākṣoghna (Rg. IV. 4.1-15 or X. 87. 1-25) and Pavamāna (Rg. IX. 1. 1-10) mantras and round the house water is continuously poured in a stream from & jar with the same two hymns. A pit is dug in the south-east corner of the house which is cowdunged, worshipped with flowers and sandalwood paste and a baked brick box containing seven kinds of corn, moss, flowers &c. is lowered into it and the pit is filled up. Then the house is entered to the accompaniment

of musio by the owner who is accompanied by his wife, sons and brahmanas and who holds in his folded hands an auspicious jar filled with water and having fresh sprouts, dūryā grass thereon and marked with sandalwood paste and flowers and covered with cloth. The svasti hymn (vide note 1963 above) and the hymn beginning with 'kranikradat' (Rg. II. 42. 1-3) are recited and the auspicious jar is put down on a heap of corn. Then the brābmapas perform puṇyahavācana ( vide note 503 above ), they are honoured and utter 'may the house be lucky', dinner is given to the brāhmaṇas who pronounce benedictions, and the owner then takes his meal with his friends. 1972
