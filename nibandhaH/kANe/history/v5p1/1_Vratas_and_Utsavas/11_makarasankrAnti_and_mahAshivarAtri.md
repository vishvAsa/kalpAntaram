CHAPTER XI

Makarasaṅkrānti and Mahaśivarātri

## _Makara-_saṅkrānti_

This is a very important religious observance and festival. About 70 years ago (in the author's boyhood) it occurred on the 12th or 13th January according to the several Indian almanacs then current, but now it falls, owing to the procession of the equinoxes, on the 13th or the 14th of January in the month of Pauṣa. Saṅkrānti means 'the (apparent) passage of the sun from one rāśi (sign of the Zodiac) to the next following' and hence the rāśi in which the Sun enters is designated as the saṅkrānti of that name. [^540] When the Sun leaves the rāśi called Dhanus and enters the Makararāśi that is called Makarasaṅkrānti. The rāśis are twelve and the Saṅkrānti names with their western equivalents are given in the note. [^541] There are only twelve saṅkrāntis even if there be an intercalary month in some year. Everyone of the twelve saṅkrāntis was regarded as a holy day. The Matsya-purāṇa (chap. 98 ) deals with the completion of Saṅkrānti-vrata. Briefly, it provides that on the day previous a person, whether male or female, should take food only once in the noon and on the Saṅkrānti day should brush his teeth and then take a bath with water mixed with sesame [^542].

[^540]: रवेः संक्रमणं राशौ संक्रान्तिरिति कथ्यते। स्नानदानतप:श्राद्धहोमादिषु महाफला। नागरखण्ड q. by हे. on काल P, 410; मेषादिषु द्वादशराशिषु क्रमेण सञ्चरतः सूर्यस्य पूर्वस्माद्राशेरुत्तरराशौ संक्रमणं प्रवेशः संक्रान्तिः । अतस्तद्वाशिनामपुरःसरं सा संक्रान्तिर्घ्यपदिश्यते । का. नि. p. 331.

[^541]:  मेष (Aries, Ram), वृषभ (Taurus, Bull). मिथुन (Gemini, Twins), कर्कट (Cancer, Crab), सिंह (Leo, Lion), कन्या (Virgo. Virgin). तुला (Libra, Balance), वृश्चिक (Scorpio, Scorpion), धनुः (Sagittarius, Archer), मकर (Capricornus, Goat), कुम्भ ( Aquarius, water-carrier). मीन (Pisces, Fishes), More details will be given in the next section.

[^542]: The whole of chap. 98 of मत्स्य is quoted in कृत्यकल्पतरु (on व्रत pp. 432-435).

The person should offer to a self-restrained brāhmaṇa householder three vessels containing edibles together with a cow intending them to be for Yama, Rudra and Dharma and repeat four verses one of which is as follows: "As I do not make any difference between Śiva, Viṣṇu, the Sun and Brahmā, may Śhaṅkara (Śiva ) who pervades the Universe be always a bestower of welfare on me!'. [^543] The person should make, if able, further gifts of ornaments, a bedstead and golden jars ( two) to the brāhmaṇa; but, if poor, should offer only fruits to the brāhmaṇa. Then he should take his meal but without oil and should feed others according to his ability. Women also should perform this vrata. Great merit was attached to a bath in the Ganges on a saṅkrānti, on an eclipse and on New and Full moon, as such a man reached the world of Brahmā.[^544] A bath with ordinary water (not heated ) was obligatory (_nitya_) on every saṅkrānti, since the Devipurāṇa declared : [^545] “the man who would not take a bath on the holy day of Saṅkrānti would be for seven lives diseased and poor; whatever offerings are made to gods and pitṛs by men on saṅkrānti are returned to them by the Sun again in several future lives ".

## Punyakāla of saṅkrāntis

It may be stated that in ancient texts the entrance of the Sun alone in a rāśi is not regarded as holy time, but the entrance of all planets in a nakṣatra or rāśi was deemed to be a holy time. [^546] Hemādri (on Kāla p. 437) and the Kālanirṇaya (p. 345) quote three verses [^547] specifying the holy times (_puṇyakāla_ ) of the passage of the Sun and planets as follows: in the case of the Sun the puṇya-kāla is 16 ghaṭikās before and after the moment of the saṅkrānti; for the moon it is one ghaṭi and thirteen _palas_ on both sides, for Mars four ghaṭikās and one pala, for Mercury three ghaṭikās and 14 palas, for Jupiter [^548] four ghaṭikās and 37 palas, for Venus four ghaṭikās and one pala, for Saturn 82 ghaṭikās and 7 palas.

[^543]: यथा भेदं न पश्यामि शिवविष्ण्वर्कपद्मजान्। तथा ममास्तु विश्वात्मा शङ्करः शङ्करः सदा॥ मत्स्य 98. 17. The 2nd word शङ्कर means शं कल्याणं करोति.

[^545]:  रविसंक्रमणे पुण्ये न स्नायाद्यस्तु मानवः । सप्तजन्मन्यसौ रोगी निर्धनश्चोपजायते । संक्रान्तो यानि इत्तानि हव्यकव्यानि मानवैः। तानि नित्यं ददात्यर्कः पुनर्जन्मनि जन्मनि । देवीपुराण q. by का. वि. p. 380, का. नि. p. 333 (ascribes to शातातप), व.क्रि. को. (pp. 214, 212) quotes the first verse from राजमार्तण्ड. Both verses occur in रा. मा. folio 81 b verses 1406-7; vide Annals of BORI, vol. XXXVI., p. 336.

[^546]: न केवलमादित्यस्यैव संक्रमायने पुण्यकालः किं तु सर्वेषामपि ग्रहाणां नक्षत्रराशिसंक्रमे पुण्यकालो भवति । का. नि. p. 345.

[^547]: हे. on काल p. 437 quotes the verses from जैमिनि, while का.नि. quotes from simply ज्योतिःशास्त्र.

[^548]: There is a unique grant on Jupiter's entrance into Vṛṣabha (Taurus) in the Lucknow Museum plate of Kirtipāla in Vikrama year 1167 (11th February 1111 A, D.) in E. I. VII. p. 93. There are many grants made on the Sun's saṅkrāntis. For example, vide E. I. vol. VII. p. 85 (Kahla plate of Kalacuri Sodhadeva, grant being made on 24th December 1077 A. D.), E. I. XII p. 142 (Nilgunda plates of western Cālukya king Vikramaditya VI in 1087 A. D.), both on उत्तरायणसंक्रान्ति: E. I. XIV. p. 324 (grant of village in honour of Buddha on Vișuva saṅkrānti to a brāhmaṇa by Mahipala I king of Bengal).  

Though the planets also have saṅkrāntis, later writers hold that the word _saṅkrānti_ by itself means only Ravi-saṅkrānti, as stated by the Smr̥ti-kaustubha p. 531.[^549]

The twelve saṅkrāntis in the year are grouped into four classes, viz. there are two _ayana_ saṅkrāntis (that is Makara - saṅkrānti from which _udagayana_ starts and Karkaṭa-saṅkrānti from which Daksiṇāyana starts ), two Visuva saṅkrāntis (that is, Meṣa and Tulā saṅkrāntis when the day and night are equal in length ), the four saṅkrāntis called Ṣaḍaśīti or Ṣaḍasiti-mukha ( i.e. Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus and Mina) and Viṣṇupadi or Viṣṇupada ( that is, Vṛṣabha, Siṁha, Vr̥ścika and Kumbha) [^550]

[^549]: सर्वग्रहाणां राश्यन्तरसङ्क्रमणवाचिनोपि सङ्क्रान्तिशब्दस्य सङ्क्रान्तेः पुण्यकालस्तु षोडशोभयतः कला:-इत्यादि शास्त्रे रविसंक्रमणमात्रपरत्वम्। स्मृतिको. p. 331, 'संक्रान्ते...कलाः' is a verse of जाबाल (q. by कृ. र. P.614, व. क्रि. को. p. 95. from ब्रह्मवैवर्त).

[^550]: पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका III. 23-24 (p.9) defines these 'मेषतुलादौ विषुवत् षडशीतिमुखं तुलादिभागेषु । षडशीतिमुखेषु रवेः पितृदिवसा येऽवशेषाः स्युः ॥ षडशीतिमुखं कन्या चतुर्दशेऽष्टादशे च मिथुनस्य । मीनस्य द्वाविंशे षड्विंशे कार्मुकस्यांशे ॥'. तुला आदिर्यस्याः सा तुलादिः कन्या । द्वादशैव भवन्त्येषां द्विज नामानि मे शृणु । एकं विष्णुपदं नाम षडशीतिमुखं तथा ॥ विषुवं च तृतीयं च अन्ये द्वे दक्षिणोत्तरे । कुम्भालिगोहरिषु विष्णुपदं वदन्ति स्त्रीचाप मीनमिथुने षडशीतिवक्त्रम् । अर्कस्य सौम्यमयनं शशिधाम्नि याम्यमृक्षे झषे विषुवति त्वजतौलिनोः स्यात् ॥ ब्रह्मवैवर्त q. by हे. on काल p. 407. Some words require explanation. अलि = वृश्चिक, गो = वृषभ, हरि = सिंह, स्त्री = कन्या, चाप = धनुः, शशिधाम्नि - शशिगृहे = कर्कटके, सोम्यमयनं = उत्तरायणं, याम्य = दक्षिणायन ( यम is the lord of the south), झष = मकर, अज = मेष, तौली (one holding a balance)-तुला. Similar Verses are quoted by हे. (on काल P. 408) from वसिष्ठ, which are quoted as from वृद्धवसिष्ठ by का. नि. p. 332. Some of these verses of वसिष्ठ are the same in अग्निपुराण as quoted by व.क्रि. कौ. p. 204. The राजमार्तण्ड (Annals BORI, vol. XXXVI, p. 338 verse 275) defines षडशीति and विष्णुपदी. For tention of Ṣaḍaśītimukha-saṅkrānti in an epigraphic record, vide Canarese Ins. of Devagiri Yādava king Mahādeva in śake 1185 (= Sunday 27th May 1263 A. D.) in I. A. vol. 25 p. 346.

Saṅkrānti gradually came to be deified and the Devīpurāṇa identified it with Durgā herself. The Devīpurāṇa says " Devi is all-pervading on account of the division into very small and large parts in the form of year, _ayana_, season, month, fortnight, day and the like. Devi bestows rewards in accordance with the divisions into meritorious and sinful ( actions).[^551] Even one act done at that time ( of Saṅkrānti) yields results multiplied crores of times. From dharma (righteous acts) increase life, kingdom, progeny, happiness and the like, from _adharma_ (unrighteous conduct) spring diseases, sorrows and the like; whatever is donated and whatever japa is performed near (i.e, at the time of ) Viṣuva ( Meṣa and Tula) saṅkrāntis and at the _ayana_ ( Makara and Karkaṭa saṅkrāntis ) becomes inexhaustible; the same holds good about Viṣṇupada and Ṣadaśīti-mukha'.

The exact moment of time when the sun leaves one rāśi and enters the next following rāśi is impossible of being marked by the eyes of flesh (ordinary human eyes). Therefore thirty ghaṭikās before and after the moment of Saṅkrānti are said to be the time. [^552]

In order to convey how infinitesimally small is the time of the Sun's entrance into a rāśi after leaving another the Devi puraṇa has [^553] the following : “ thirtieth part of the time taken by the throb of the eye of a man sitting happily at ease is called 'tatpara'; one hundredth part of 'tatpara' is called 'truti'; one hundredth part of truti' is the (duration of ) time of the sun's passage ( from one rāśi into another ). As it is not possible to perform on such an infinitesimally small point of time the rites prescribed for performance on saṅkrānti, one has to accept periods of time near this moment as the proper time.

(on काल pp. 418-419), कु. र. pp. 614-615. कृत्यकल्प (नैयत.) quotes all verses from पुण्यपापविभागेन on p. 361 and the first verse on p. 362.

[^552]: तदाह देवलः। संक्रान्तिसमयः सूक्ष्मो दुर्जेयः पिशितेक्षणैः। तद्योगादप्यधश्चोर्वे त्रिंशन्नाडयः पवित्रिताः। इति। देशाव्यवधानादत्यन्तसंश्लिष्टयोः पूर्वोत्तरराश्योर्मध्ये सूर्यः पूर्व राशिं परित्यज्य यावता काललेशेनोत्तरराशिं प्रविशति स लेशो योगदृष्टिं विना मांसदृष्टया दुर्लक्ष्यः। अतोऽनुष्ठाने मुख्यसंक्रान्तिकालासंभवात् संक्रान्तिसम्बन्धिनौ पूर्वोत्तरकालौ ग्रहीतव्यौ। का. नि. p. 333; हे. (on काल p. 417) attributes this verse to वसिष्ठ and explains त्रिंशन्नाडयः in two ways 'अधश्च त्रिंशन्नाड्यः ऊर्ध्वे च त्रिंशन्नाडयः पुण्यकालः। यद्वा त्रिंशन्नाड्यः पूर्वे पञ्चदश पश्चात्पञ्चदशेति ज्ञेयम्'।.

## Proper time for rites on saṅkrānti

The first rule is that the nearer[^554] the ghaṭikās are to the time of actual entrance the holier they are. Therefore it is laid down that in saṅkrāntis the puṇyatama-kala (holiest time) is sevenfold[^555] viz. three, four, five, seven, eight, nine or twelve ghaṭikās; during those periods real merit is accumulated. If one cannot perform the prescribed rites within these limits thirty ghaṭikās are permitted as the highest limit in the texts for the _puṇyakāla_ (holy time) for all saṅkrāntis except Ṣadaśīti (in which the maximum puṇyakāla is 60 ghaṭikās) and Viṣṇupadi (where it is 16 ghaṭikās before and after). [^556]

Each of these twelve saṅkrāntis in the year is seven-fold (i.e. has seven different names) according as it occurs on a particular week day or in conjunction with certain classes of nakṣatras. The seven names [^557] are : Manda, Mandākini, Dhvāṅkṣī, Ghorā, Mahodari, Rākṣasi, and Miśritā. A saṅkrānti (such as Meṣa or Karka or Makara) is called Ghorā if it occurs on Sunday, Dhvāṅkṣī on Monday, Mahodari on Tuesday, Mandākini on Wednesday, Mandā on Thursday, Miśritā on Friday and Rākṣasi on Saturday. Again, a saṅkrānti (like Meṣa or Karka and so on) is called respectively Manda, Mandākini, Dhvāṅkṣī Ghorā, Mahodari, Rākṣasi, Miśritā according as it commences respectively on nakṣatras called dhruva, mr̥du, kṣipra, ugra, cara, krūra, miśrita.

(on काल) p. 408-409, का. नि. pp. 340-341 (only the first 1 1/2 verses), स. म. p. 137: कृत्यकल्प (नेयत) p. 360 quotes the first 1 1/2 verses.

Vide note below [^558] for the nakṣatras falling under these 7 groups. It is further provided that the ghaṭikās from two ( or three) to twelve said to be the holiest times (in note [^555] above) are to be taken as respectively referring to the seven kinds of saṅkrānti i.e. two or three ghaṭikās is the holiest time in Mandā saṅkrānti, four ghaṭikās in Mandākini saṅkrānti and so on. It is laid down that Mandā saṅkrānṭi is beneficial to brāhmaṇas, Mandākini to kṣatriyas, Dhvāṅkṣī to vaiśyas, Ghora to Śūdras, Mahodari to thieves, Rākṣasī brings success to vendors of liquor and Miśritā increases the ( profit of the) avocations of Cāṇḍalas, Pukkasas, of those whose business is of a terrible nature and of all craftsmen ( vide Hemādri on Kāla pp. 409-410 and Varṣakriya-kaumudi p. 210 quoting Devipurāṇa ).

There is some conflict on the question of the general rule about the extent of _puṇyakala_ on a saṅkrānti. Śatātapa,[^559] Jābāla and Marici prescribe the sixteen ghaṭikās before and after the moment of Saṅkrānti as the puṇyakāla for the performance of the religious acts prescribed on saṅkrānti. On the other hand, the Devipurāṇa[^560] and Vasiṣṭha lay down fifteen ghaṭikās each before and after saṅkrānti as the puṇyakāla. This conflict is removed in various ways. One is to hold that the Devīpurāṇa is not restrictive but what it means is only this that lesser limits are meant to indicate that greater merit results by their observance. Another explanation was to hold that the limit of 16 ghaṭikās applied to saṅkrāntis called Viṣṇupadi.

[^558]: The 27 or 28 नक्षत्रs are arranged in 7 groups as follows: ध्रुव (or स्थिर)-उत्तराफल्गुनी, उत्तराषाढा, उत्तराभाद्रपदा, रोहिणी; मृदु-अनुराधा, चित्रा, रेवती, मृगशीर्ष, क्षिप्र (or लघु)-हस्त, अश्विनी, पुष्य, अभिजित्; उग्र-पूर्वाफल्गुनी, पूर्वाषाढा, पूर्वाभाद्रपदा, भरणी, मघा, चर--पुनर्वसु, श्रवण, धनिष्ठा, स्वाती, शतभिषक, क्रूर (or तीक्ष्ण) मूल, ज्येष्ठा, आर्द्रा, आश्लेषा, मिश्रित (or मृदुतीक्ष्ण or साधारण) कृत्तिका, विशाखा. Vide बृहत्संहिता 98.6-11 (Kern's ed.) for these lists and कृत्यकल्प (नैयत.) p. 361, है. on काल p. 409, का. नि. p. 341-342, स. म. p 137, बृहत्संहिता 98.9 and कृत्यकल्प० (नैयत) do not mention अभिजित् among लघु group.

## Makarasaṅkrānti

A saṅkrānti may take place by day or at night. If Saṅkrānti occurs by day that whole day is puṇyakāla. If Saṅkrānti occurs by night, lengthy and complicated discussions occur in Hemādri, Mādhava and others. One rule evolved is that in ten saṅkrāntis excluding Makara and Karkaṭa saṅkrāntis the puṇyakāla is by day when those saṅkrāntis occur by night.

Several exceptions are engrafted on the general rule about 15 or 16 ghaṭikās before and after a saṅkrānti being the puṇyakāla. Therefore, several works like the Tithitattva (pp. 144-145 ) and Dharmasindhu (pp. 2–3) give brief final conclusions on this topic. I summarize[^560a] the conclusions of the latter work. On the Sun's passage in Meṣa and Tulā the puṇyakāla is fifteen ghaṭikās before and after S ( some say ten ghaṭikās ); in Vr̥ṣabha, Siṁha, Vr̥ścika, Kumbha S, P is sixteen gh. before S; in Mithuna S, Kanya, Dhanus and Mina S, P is 16 gh, after S; in Karkaṭa S, P is thirty gh. after S; in Makara S, P is forty gh. after S. If Saṅkrānti occurs by day when a period of two ghaṭikās or less only remains before the close of the day then in the case of Mithuna, Kanyā, Dhanus, Mina and also Makara saṅkrāntis P is before S for the gh. specified above against each; if S occurs in the morning at a period of two gh, or less from sunrise then in Vr̥ṣabha, Siṁha, Vṛścika, Kumbha and also Karkaṭa S, P is after S for the period specified above. If S occurs at night but before midnight, P is latter half of the day time before the S; if S occurs at midnight or later than midnight but in the night, P is on two days viz. the latter half of the daytime before S and the first half of the day after S; this applies to all S except Makara and Karkaṭa. When Uttarāyana begins in Makara in the night P is the day after S and if S begins in Karkaṭa at night P is the day prior; if Makara S occurs at evening twilight (i.e. during three ghaṭikās after sunset ) then P is on the previous day; if Karka S occurs in morning twilight (i.e. during three gh. before sunrise ) then P is on the day following the S.

[^560a]: In this summary S, stands for saṅkrānti or Śaṅkrāntis, gh. for ghaṭikās, P. for puṇyakāla.

## Recommended gifts on saṅkrāntis

This discussion about the puṇyakāla is necessary because a bath is to be taken and gifts are to be made during that time in order to secure the full merit thereof. The general rule is that a bath is not to be taken and a gift is not to be made at night. Parāśara [^561] says 'a bath by day purified by the rays of the Sun is commended; bathing at night is not commended except on seeing an eclipse'. The Viṣṇudharmasutra says the same. But several exceptions were recognized. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa [^562] provides one should not take a bath at night and particularly should not make a gift at night, but a bath and a gift may be made at night on proper occasions. A gift at night is commended in an eclipse, marriage, saṅkrānti, pilgrimage, on death, on the birth of a child and at (before sitting down for) hearing _itihāsa_ (Mahābhārata)'. Gobhila[^563] provides 'people may bathe and make gifts at night in eclipses, saṅkrāntis, marriage, in distress (or death) and on the birth of a child and in vratas undertaken for a desired object'. A bath is therefore obligatory on every saṅkrānti and particularly in Makara-saṅkrānti. There are special recommendations about gifts in Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 414-419 ) which are taken by him from Viśvāmitra and which are borrowed by Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 4-5), Samayamayūkha (pp. 143-144) and others and which are as follows: gift of ram on Meṣa, of cows on Vr̥ṣabha, of clothes, food and drinks on Mithuna, of ghr̥tadhenu[^564] on Karkaṭa, of a conveyance with some gold on Siṁha, of clothes and cows on Kanyā, of different kinds of grains and seeds on Tula, on Vr̥ścika of clothes and houses, on Dhanus of clothes and conveyances, on Makara of wood and fire, on Kumbha of cows, water and grass, on Mina of fresh flowers. Special gifts are required to be made on Makarasaṅkrānti.

 The Skanda [^565] says "He who donates _tiladhenu_ on Uttarāyana (i.e. Makarasaṅkrānti) secures all objects and obtains the highest happiness.' The Viṣṇudharmottara provides the gift of garments on Uttarāyaṇa yields great reward (merit). A man becomes free from diseases by donating sesame and a draught bull'. The Śivarahasya declares that Śiva after he performed the Gosava sacrifice created sesame on Makara-saṅkrānti for the gratification of all men and provides 'men should bathe in water in which sesame are mixed and one should rub one's body with sesame; _tarpaṇa_ of gods and pitr̥s should be made with water in which sesame have been put; sesame should be given to brāhmaṇas on Uttarāyana saṅkrānti; one should eat sesame and perform _homa_ with them; those who perform homa with sesame and honour brāhmaṇas shine in the heaven (as stars) like those who donate a thousand cows; auspicious lamps fed with oil of sesame should be lighted in Śiva temples and a brāhmaṇa should worship God (Śiva ) with grains of rice and sesame'. The Kālikā-purāṇa (q. by Hemādri on Kāla p. 413 and Kṛtyakalpao, Naiyata, pp. 366-67) provides : 'one should place on the top of (the liṅga emblem of) God (Śiva) the five jewels viz. gold, diamond, sapphire, ruby and pearl; but if a man has none of these he may place in Uttarāyaṇa on the top of the liṅga gold one [^566] _karṣa_ or half karsa in weight; he should worship with plenty of ghee prepared from cow's milk and should donate ghee and a blanket after washing and pressing it; he should give condiments and a dinner to brāhmaṇas and ascetics and honour them with daksiṇā'.

[^566]: Karṣa is a weight of gold or silver equal to 16 māṣas =80 raktikās i.e, about 176 grains.

A person should also observe a fast for three days or one day in honour of Makara-saṅkrānti [^567]. A man who fasts for three days and after a bath offers worship to the Sun on _ayana_ (i.e. start of Sun's apparent passage to the north or south), on Viṣuva day and on the eclipse of the sun or the moon secures the fulfilment of all his desires'. Āpastamba says 'A man who after a bath fasts the whole day on _ayana_, Viṣuva and an eclipse of the sun or moon becomes free from all sins. But a householder that has a son living was not to observe a fast on a Sunday, on saṅkrānti and on the Sun's and Moon's eclipse'.

The great merit collected by gifts on saṅkrāntis is set forth by the Rajamārtaṇḍa[^568] in two verses 'The reward ( of gifts) on ayana-saṅkrānti is a crore of times ( as much as of the same gift on an ordinary day) and on Viṣṇupadi a hundred thousand times; it is declared to be 86000 times on Ṣaḍaśiti. Gift on the eclipse of the moon is a hundredfold ( in merit) and a thousandfold on sun's eclipse, one hundred thousand times on Viṣuva days, and of endless duration on the Full Moon days of Āṣāḍha, Kārtika, Māgha and Vaiśākha. The Bhaviṣya highly praises a bath in the Ganges on _ayana_ and _Viṣuva_ saṅkrāntis. 'He who bathes in the waters of the Ganges on ayana and Viṣuva secures the fruit of bathing in the Ganges for half a year'. Vide Vi. Dh. III. 319. 38-45 about the gifts to be made on the several saṅkrāntis and the rewards of such gifts (q. by Dāna-sāgara pp. 646-647) and C. I. I. vol. IV. Nos. 28, 23, 22 for grants on Meṣa, Karka and Tulā saṅkrāntis.

## Śrāddha on sāṅkrānti

Some prescribe that śrāddha should be performed on Saṅkrānti. The Viṣṇudharmasūtra [^569] provides : 'the passage of the sun (from one rāśi into another), the two Viṣuva days, and specially the _ayana_ days, Vyatīpāta (yoga), the nakṣatra of one's birth and auspicious occasions (such as a marriage, birth of a son); Prajāpati declares that these are times for śrāddha that are kāmya (i.e. they fulfil the desires one may entertain and are optional); śrāddha performed on these days tends to produce inexhaustible gratification (to the pitr̥s )'. Here again there was conflict. Śūlapāṇi held that the śrāddha on saṅkrānti included _piṇḍadāna_ while the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 6) holds that the śrāddha should be of the _pārvaṇa_ type but without _piṇḍas_. Just as some acts such as a bath, fast and gifts were specially commended, so certain acts were forbidden on the days of saṅkrāntis. The Viṣṇupurāṇa [^570] provides : The 14th tithi, 8th tithi, amāvāsyā and pūrṇimā and the Sun's passage ( from one rāśi to another ), these are called _parvan_. The man who has sexual intercourse and partakes of oil and flesh on these parvan days goes to a hell called 'Viṇmūtra-bhojana' (where the food is excreta and urine ). The Brahmapurāṇa [^571] also says 'one should give up sexual intercourse, oil and meat on the 8th tithi, the last tithis of the two fortnights, on the day of the sun's saṅkrānti and on the penultimate day (14th tithi) in each _pakṣa_ (half of a month)'.

Hemādri ( on Vrata, vol. II. pp. 727-743) mentions fifteen saṅkrānti vratas such as the Sujanmāvāpti-vrata from Viṣṇu dharmottara, Devipurāṇa and Skandapurāṇa, which would be mentioned in the list of vratas added later on.

In modern times Makarasaṅkrānti is more a social festival than a religious one. No fast is observed and hardly anyone performs śrāddha, though many people bathe in the sea or in _tirthas_ like the Ganges at Prayāga and elsewhere. Sesame are very much in evidence, particularly in the Deccan and people greet each other by giving articles from simple sesame and jaggery to artistic sugared preparations of sesame coloured with saffron and go about saying 'take these sesame and jaggery and speak sweet words' (in Marathi).

[^569]: आदित्यसङ्क्रमणं विषुवद्वयं विशेषेणायनद्वयं व्यतीपातो जन्मर्क्षमभ्युदयश्च । एतांस्तु श्राद्धकालान् वै काम्यानाह प्रजापतिः। श्राद्धमेतेषु यद्दत्तं तदानन्त्याय कल्पते। विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 77. 1-2.

The importance of tilas (sesame) is brought out in the following: A person [^572] who uses sesame in six ways does not sink (is not unsuccessful or unlucky) i.e. who rubs his body with sesame, who bathes with sesame, who is pure and always offers water mixed with sesame (to his deceased ancestors), and who offers sesame into fire, who makes a gift of sesame and who eats sesame.

Gifts are made in these days on Makarasaṅkrānti, but mostly by women. They honour priests by donating vessels (of clay, copper or brass) containing several things such as betelnuts and coins and also invite their women friends and distribute among them earthen vessels containing red powder, pieces of turmeric, betelnut and also separately several other things such as sugarcane stalks. In south India there is a festival called Pongal [^573] which corresponds with the Makara saṅkrānti observed in Northern and Western India, Pongal being the first day of the Tamil year. This South Indian festival lasts for three days.

According to the modern astronomical calculations, the winter solstice occurs on 21st December and on that day commences the Sun's apparent march towards the north. But in India people who follow the almanacs based on the ancient methods and data think that the Sun's march towards the north takes place on the 14th of January. They are thus about twenty three days behind the correct Makarasaṅkrānti owing to the precesion of the equinoxes. This fact was recognized even in the medieval Dharmaśāstra works.

[^573]: The word 'Pongal' is derived from a Tamil word meaning 'Is it boiling or is it being cooked ?"

## Saṅkrānti day and precession

For example, Hemādri [^574] says that twelve days before the (popular) day of a saṅkrānti, the real puṇyakāla occurs and therefore gifts and the like prescribed on the occasion of saṅkrānti should also be performed on the day twelve days prior to the popular saṅkrānti day.

The origin of the observances of Makarasaṅkrānti cannot be very ancient. The Sun's apparent northward march for six months has been mentioned in Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣad texts at least a thousand years before Christ. For example, the Śatapatha [^575] Br. states 'That half moon which increases represents the gods and that which decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods and the night represents the fathers. And further, the forenoon represents the gods and the afternoon the fathers. ...Now when he (the sun) moves northwards then he is among the gods, then he guards the gods; and when he moves southwards then he is among the fathers, then he guards the fathers.' The Chandogya-Upaniṣad [^576] contains a reference to the Sun's passage to the north during six months in the words 'from light to day, from day to the bright half of the month, from the bright half of the month to the six months during which the sun goes towards the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the Sun &c.' But here the word _udag-ayana_ is not expressly employed. The word 'ayana' occurs in the Ṛgveda III 33.7 (āyannāpo ayanam-icchamānāḥ) 'the waters seeking a passage went rushing.' Here 'ayana' has the etymological sense of passage' or 'place.' But in the gṛhyasūtras the word 'udagayana' in the sense of the sun's northward passage occurs.

[^574]: अयनांशकतुल्येन कालेनैव स्फुटं भवेत् । मृगकर्कादिगे सूर्ये याम्योदगयने सति । तदा संक्रान्तिकालाः स्युरुक्ता विषुवदादयः ॥ अयमर्थः। ... यावद्भिरंशैरयनच्युतिर्भवति तावता सूर्यस्य भोग्यकालेन भाविना विष्णुपदादिकानां च्युतिर्भवति ततश्च द्वादशभिरंशेरयनच्युतिर्भवति । तत्र भाविन्याः संक्रान्तेर्द्वादशभिर्दिनैरर्वाक् पुण्यकालो भवति तस्मिन् संक्रान्तिनिमित्तं दानादि कर्तव्यमिति। हे. on काल pp. 436-437. From नि. सि. p. 5 it appears that Aparārka also said in his comment on Yaj I. 217 after quoting Viṣṇudharmasūtra 77. 1-2 that the difference between the real Makarasaṅkrānti day and popular Makarasaṅkrānti day was twelve days. But those words as quoted by N. S. from Aparārka are not found in the printed Aparārka at p. 426 (Anandāsrama ed.).

[^575]: य एवापूर्यतेऽर्धमासः स देवा योऽपक्षीयते स पितरोऽहरेव देवा रात्रिः पितरः पुनरह्नः पूर्वाह्नो देवा अपराह्नः पितरः। ... स यत्रोदगावर्तते देवेषु तर्हि भवति देवांस्तर्ह्यभि गोपायति। ... यत्र दक्षिणावर्तते पितृषु तर्हि भवति ... । स यत्रोदगावर्तते तर्ह्यग्नी आदधीत। शतपथ II. 1. 3. 1, 3 and 4. The कौषीतकि-ब्राह्मण 19. 3 also has a striking passage 'स षण्मासान्नुदङ्ङित्वा तिष्ठते दक्षिणावर्त्स्यन्नुपेमे वसन्ति वैषुवतीयेनाह्ना यक्ष्यमाणाः'

[^576]: अर्चिषोऽहरह्न आपूर्यमाणपक्षमापूर्यमाणपक्षाद्यान्षडुदङ्ङेति मासांस्तान् मासेम्यः संवत्सरं संवत्सरादादित्यं ...। छा. उ. IV. 15.5 and V. 10. 1-2.

The Āśvalāyana-gṛhya[^577] prescribes the auspicious times for certain domestic rites as follows: 'in the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious nakṣatra, _caula_ ( child's tonsure ), _upanayana_, _godāna_ and marriage may be celebrated; according to some teachers a marriage may be celebrated at all times ( not necessarily in northward passage of the sun &c.)'. But here no rāśi name appears. In Jaimini VI. 8. 23 it is provided that rites for gods are to be performed in the northward passage of the Sun, some day in the bright half of the month and on an auspicious day. As a matter of fact, none of the ancient Śrauta, Gṛhya or Dharmasūtras mentions any rāśis or prescribes any auspicious or inauspicious times concerned with rāśis but only times in relation to nakṣatras. Some people try to interpret the words '_susthe indau_' (when the moon is well placed i.e. auspicious) in Yaj. I. 80 as referring to rāśis, but they forget or ignore the fact that the earliest extant commentator of Yājñavalkya, Viśvarūpa, explains those words as referring to nakṣatras and not to rāśis. The subject about the introduction of rāśis will be briefly discussed in the next section on Kāla and Muhūrta. As udagayana had already been regarded for many centuries as an auspicious period, naturally Makarasaṅkrānti from which the northward passage of the Sun starts became a very sacred day, when the rāśi system was introduced. Why so much importance was attached to sesame on this Makarasaṅkrānti day it is difficult to say. Probably in view of the cold prevailing at the time of the beginning of uttarāyana an oily substance like sesame easily available and of great food value was selected. In any case the observances and festival of Makarasaṅkrānti do not appear to be much older than the beginning of the Christian era.

[^577]: उदगयने आपूर्यमाणपक्षे कल्याणे नक्षत्रे चौलकर्मोपनयनगोदानविवाहाः । सार्वकालमेके विवाहम् । आश्व. गृ. I. 4. 1-2. The कौषीतकिगृह्य I. 5. is almost the same 'उदगयन आपूर्यमाणपक्षे पुण्याहे कुमार्यै पाणिं गृह्णीयाद्या लक्षणसम्पन्ना स्यात् ।'. उदगयनपूर्वपक्षाहःपुण्याहेषु दैवानि स्मृतिरूपान्यार्थदर्शनात्। जै. VI. 8. 23. The आप. गृ. I. 1. 2 is almost the same 'उदगयनपूर्वपक्षाहःपुण्याहेषु कार्याणि'.

## Imaginary appearance of saṅkrānti

In modern pañcāṅgas, Makarasaṅkrānti, being deemed to be a deity, several curious matters are added, viz. saṅkrānti rides on some _vāhana_ (principal vehicle or draught animal such as an elephant) and an upavāhana ( as ancillary vehicle ), she wears a garment either dark, white or red or of some other colour, she is supposed to carry a weapon (such as a bow or javelin), she applies a tilaka of some substance (like lac, gorocana), she is either young, middle-aged or old, her posture ( sitting, standing &c. ) is mentioned, the flower she holds, the food she eats, the ornament she wears-these are mentioned, her two names out of the seven mentioned above on p. 215 note [^557] based on the week day and the nakṣatra on which saṅkrānti takes place) are specified, she is supposed to come from one direction (east or the like), to proceed to another ( such as the west &c.) and to cast a glance at a third direction; then her bodily form is described such as drooping lips, long nose, with nine arms (or the like). And the prognostications are as follows: whatever things saṅkrānti accepts, their prices rise or they are destroyed and whatever she glances at is ruined; happy are the people in the direction from which she comes and unhappy are those in the direction she goes.

## Mahāśivarātri

Mahāśivarātri: The 14th tithi of the dark half of a month is called Śivarātri, but the 14th of the dark half in Māgha (or in Phālguna according to the pūrṇimānta reckoning) is the Śivarātri par excellence and is often designated Mahāśivarātri.

The Garuḍapurāṇa I. 124, Skanda I. 1.33, Padma VI. 240, Agni 193 contain the Māhātmya of the Śivarātri on the 14th of the dark half of Māgha. Though some details differ, in all these the main outlines are the same.

All these praise Śivarātri-vrata highly. When after [^578] observing a fast on that day, Śiva is worshipped with _bilva_ leaves and _jāgara_ for the whole night is observed, Śiva saves the man from hell and bestows enjoyment of happiness and mokṣa and the man becomes like Śiva himself. Gifts, sacrifices, austerities, pilgrimages and observances of vratas are not equal to even one ten-millionth part of Śivarātri.

[^578]: माघफाल्गुनयोर्मध्ये कृष्णा या तु चतुर्दशी। तस्यां जागरणाद्रुद्रः पूजितो भुक्तिमुक्तिदः॥ उपोषितैः पूजितः सन्नरकात्तारयेत्तथा। गरुड I. 124. 2-3; माघफा ... चतुर्दशी। शिवरात्रीति विज्ञेया सर्वपापापहारिणी। कृतोपवासा ये तस्यां शिवमर्चन्ति जाग्रतः। बिल्वपत्रैश्चतुर्यामं ते यान्ति शिवतुल्यताम् ॥ ... माघफा... चतुर्दशी। शिवरात्रिरिति ख्याता सर्वयज्ञोत्तमोत्तमा ॥ दानयज्ञतपस्तीर्थव्रतकर्माणि यानि च। शिवरात्रिव्रतस्यापि कोट्यंशेम समानि म । पद्म VI.124. 3-4 and 28-29.

The story that illustrates this extremely exaggerated praise of Śivarātri in the Garuḍapurāṇa seems to be the older of the three and therefore it is briefly set out here. There was a king of _niṣādas_ named Sundarasenaka on Mount Abu, who went out to a forest for hunting with his dog. He bagged no animal and being oppressed by hunger and thirst he remained awake the whole night on the bank of a tank in a thicket of trees. Underneath a bilva tree there was a Śivaliṅga and in an effort to keep his body at ease he throw down leaves of the bilva tree which fell on the top of the liṅga without his knowing it. In order to put down dust he (took water from the tank and) splashed it so that it fell on the liṅga and one of his arrows fell down from his hands on the liṅga through inadvertence which he took from the liṅga by falling on his knees before the liṅga. In this way he unconsciously bathed the liṅga, touched it, worshipped it (with bilva leaves) and kept awake the whole night. In the morning he came back to his house and partook of food given by his wife. When he died in course of time he was seized by the myrmidons of Yama, when Śiva's attendants fought with them and liberated him and he became a sinless attendant of Śiva together with his dog. In this way he collected merit without knowing it; if a person does with [^579] full knowledge ( what the niṣāda did without knowing ) the merit is inexhaustible. The Agnipurāṇa expressly mentions the hunter Sundarasenaka [^580]. The whole chapter of Garuḍa is quoted in the Varṣakriyā-kaumudi pp. 512-513.

[^579]: एषमज्ञानतः पुण्यं ज्ञानात्पुण्यमथाक्षयम् । गरुड I. 124.11.  

[^580]: लुब्धकः प्राप्तवान्पुण्यं पापी सुन्दरसेनकः॥ अगिए. 193.6.

## A Kirāta and śivarātri

The story in the Skanda is more elaborate. There it is a wicked _Kirāta_ named Caṇḍa who killed fish by catching them in his nets and killed also many animals and birds. He had a wife who matched him in his cruelty. Thus passed many years. One day he ascended a bilva tree taking water in a quiver desirous of killing a wild boar and passed the whole night without sleep keeping a watch and cast down many bilva leaves which fell on a liṅga at the bottom of the bilva tree. He also rinsed his mouth with water from the quiver, that fell on the liṅga. In this way he worshipped Śiva in all ways, viz. he bathed (_snapana_) the liṅga with water, he worshipped liṅga with numberless bilva leaves and he kept awake the whole night and was without food that day. He alighted from the tree and began, after reaching the tank, to catch fish. Because he did not return home that night, his wife went without food and water and passed that night in anxiety. In the morning she came to that forest with some food for her husband and seeing her husband on the other side of a river, she placed the food on the river bank and began to cross the river. They both bathed in the river, but before the kirāta could reach the food a dog came there and ate all the food. When the wife wanted to kill the dog the kirāta whose heart was softened persuaded his wife to desist from killing the dog. By that time it was noon (on amāvāsyā) and Śiva's attendants came there to take both the husband and wife as he had worshipped ( though unknowingly ) the liṅga and as both had fasted on 14th. The kirāta and his wife reached Śivaloka. The Padmapurāṇa (VI. 240. 32 ff) weaves, as the Skanda does, its story round a niṣāda.

There is a conflict of views about what the chief thing is in Śivarātri is. The Tithitattva holds that a fast is the principal thing in Śivaratri and relies on the words of Śaṅkara. "On that tithi ( Śivarātri) I am not so pleased with bath (of the liṅga) nor with clothes (offered to the liṅga) nor with incense nor by worship nor with the offering of flowers as I am pleased by a fast'.[^581] On the other hand, Hemādri and Mādhava hold that Śivarātri means fast, worship and _jāgaraṇa_ [^582] and all the three are apprehended as principal and quote passages from the Skandapurāṇa and Nāgarakhaṇḍa in support.[^583] 'That man who observes a fast on Śivaratri for twelve years and who keeps awake ( in dance and music ) before me the whole night would reach heaven. That man, who worships Śiva and performs jāgara on the 14th, would not thereafter taste milk at mother's breast (i.e. would not be born again); the niṣāda, unknowingly worshipping a self-existent liṅga, observing a fast and jāgara, became free from sin and attained the position of the attendant of Śiva'.

In the Kālanirṇaya [^584] there is a lengthy discussion on the question whether the word 'Śivarātri' is used in a conventional sense ( viz. a particular tithi) or in an etymological sense (every night on which some observance relating to Śiva is performed), or a metaphorical sense (viz. a vrata, though the word expresses a tithi) or a _yogarūḍha_ sense i.e. etymological cum conventional like the word paṅkaja ( a lotus). The conclusion established is that the word Śivarātri is yogarūḍha like the word paṅkaja ( lotus), which does spring from mud (so far the sense is etymological) but which is confined to only one thing viz. lotus (so far there is rūḍhi or convention) and does not apply to a frog.

Śivarātrivrata is both _nitya_ (obligatory ) and _kāmya_ (optional). It is nitya because there are passages which lay down that sin follows if a man does not perform it [^585]; 'the being that does not worship with devotion Rudra who is the lord of three worlds wanders through thousands of future lives'. Besides, there are verses which lay down that the vrata should be performed every[^586] year: 'O great goddess! a man and a chaste woman should every year worship Mahādeva with devotion on Śivarātri'. This vrata is optional because the texts provide the rewards of performing this vrata. For example, vide p. 85 above and p. 86 above for the maxim of _saṁyoga-pr̥thaktva_.

## Fruits of śivarātrivrata

This vrata according to the Isanasamhita [^587] can be performed by all human beings. "The Śivarātrivrata destroys all sins and confers enjoyment of happiness and mokṣa (final liberation ) on all human beings including cāṇḍālas'.

The Īśānasamhitā provides: a devotee of Viṣṇu or Śiva or of another god, if he gives up Śivarātri, destroys all the fruits of his worship (of the deity to whom he is devoted). Everyone[^588] who performs this vrata has to observe certain restrictions, viz. non-injury, truthfulness, freedom from anger, celibacy, compassion, forbearance and he has to be calm in mind, devoid of fits of passion and has to perform austerities and he should be free from malice; knowledge of this vrata should be imparted to such a one provided he follows his preceptor; if one imparts it other wise, one goes to hell.

The proper time for this vrata is night, since, as stated in the Skanda [^589] 'goblins, the Śaktis and Śiva (who wields the trident) move about at night and therefore these are to be worshipped at that time on caturdaśi.' The Skanda[^590] provides 'A fast should be observed on that caturdaśi of the dark half that is joined to niśitha (i.e. that exists at that time); that tithi is the best and leads to companionship with Śiva'. Hemādri quotes Nāgarakhanda[^591] as follows: on the 14th of the dark half of Māgha I shall go in the Kaliyuga on the surface of the earth at night and not by day. I shall undoubtedly transfer myself to all liṅgas, whether movable or permanently fixed, for the removal of the sins committed in the (preceding ) year; therefore the man who offers worship to me at night with these mantras will be free from sin'. In the Iśānasamhitā it is said 'The first God (Śiva ) appeared in the form of Śivaliṅga, whose refulgence was equal to that of a crore of suns, on the 14th of Māgha dark half. The tithi to be accepted for the Śivarātri vrata should be one that covers that time. A man should perform this vrata on that tithi when the 14th covers the time before and after midnight.'[^592] Hemādri also quotes a verse like this 'The 14th tithi called Śivarātri that covers _pradoṣa_ should be accepted (for vrata); one should observe a fast on that tithi since there has to be a jāgara (in that vrata) at night.'[^593]

Owing to the above somewhat conflicting dicta there is a great deal of discussion on the proper day and time for the vrata in Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 298–308), Kālanirṇaya (pp. 297 ff). Tithitattva (pp. 125-126), Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 222-224), Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi (pp. 248–253) and other works. Some works like the Nirṇayāmṛta[^594] put emphasis on the word _pradoṣa_ (in note 593) above, while others emphasize the word _niśitha_ and ardharātra. The conclusions drawn by Mādhava (the prince of nirṇayakāras) are stated here. If caturdaśi covers both pradoṣa and niśitha, then the vrata should be observed on that day. If caturdaśī spreads over two days (i.e. it is mixed with 13th and also with amāvāsya) and 14th exists at the time of niśitha on both days, or if it does not so exist on any of the two days, then covering pradoṣa is the determining factor; where 14th covers pradoṣa on two days or does not cover pradoṣa on any of the two days, then existing at niśitha is the determining factor; if caturdaśi having extended over two days covers only one out of the two (pradoṣa and niśitha) on each day then conjunction with Jayā (i.e. 13th tithi) is the decisive factor[^595].

## Description of śivarātrivrata

A brief description of how Śivarātrivrata was performed in ancient times may be gathered from Garuḍapurāṇa I. 124. 11-23. After honouring Śiva on the 13th tithi the man who is to undertake the vrata should resolve to observe certain restrictions. He should declare 'O God I shall keep awake the whole night on the 14th tithi. I shall make according to my ability worship, gifts, austerities and _homa_. O Śambhu! on 14th I shall take no food and shall take food on the next day. Oh Lord! be thou my refuge for securing enjoyment of happiness and mokṣa. The person observing the vrata should approach a teacher and should bathe (the liṅga) with _pañcagavya_ and with pañcamrta. He should repeat the mantra 'Om namaḥ Śivāya.' He should worship Śiva with the upacāras beginning with sandalwood paste and he should offer into fire sesame, grains of rice and boiled rice mixed with ghee. After this homa he should offer _pūrṇāhuti_ (an offering made with a full ladle) and listen to music and good stories (about Śiva). He should again offer offerings at midnight, in the 3rd quarter of the night and in the 4th quarter. Having inaudibly repeated the mūlamantra (_om namaḥ Śivāya_) he should pray to Śiva about daybreak to forgive his sins with the words 'O God! I have worshipped in this vrata without obstacles through your favour; O Lord of the worlds! O Śiva! pardon me. Whatever merit I have won this day and whatever has been offered by me to Śiva I have finished this vrata to-day through your favour; O bountiful one! be pleased with me, and go to your abode; there is no doubt that I have become pure by merely seeing you.' He should feed persons who are devoted to contemplating (on Śiva) and should give to them garments, umbrellas and the like; 'O Lord of Gods! lord of all things! that bestoweth favour on people; may my lord be gratified by what I have given with faith.' Having thus prayed for forgiveness, the person undertaking this vrata may carry it on for twelve years. After obtaining fame, wealth, sons and kingdom he may repair to the city of Śiva; he should perform jāgara (on 14th) in all the 12 months of the year; the man undertaking the vrata after feeding twelve brāhmaṇas and donating lamps may secure heaven.

The Tithitattva (p. 127) adds some details which are interesting. The liṅga is to be bathed with milk in the first watch of the night, with curds in the 2nd, with ghee in the 3rd and with honey in the 4th. The mantras in the four watches are respectively 'hrim, Iśānāya namaḥ','hrim Aghorāya namaḥ','hrim Vāmadevāya namaḥ' and 'hrim Sadyojātāya namaḥ.' The mantra at the time of offering arghya is also different in each of the four watches. It is further provided that there should be songs and dances in the first watch of the night. The Varṣakriyākaumudi (p. 513) provides that in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th watches also the person undergoing vrata has to perform worship, arghya, japa and listening to stories (about Śiva), to offer hymns of praise and make prostrations and at day-break he should pray for forgiveness with arghya water, If Māgha-kṛṣṇa 14th falls on a Sunday or Tuesday, that is most commendable for this vrata[^596].

Later medieval digests such as the Tithitattva (pp. 126 ff), the Kālatattvavivecana (pp. 197–203), Puruṣārthacintamaṇi (pp. 255-258 ), Dharmasindhu (p. 127 ) provide an elaborate description of the procedure of Śivarātri vrata. The K. T. V, remarks [^597] that the procedure of Śivarātri-vrata is different in the several purāṇas. For comparison with the one in the Garuḍa quoted above a summary of it from the Dharmasindhu is given here. On the 13th tithi the performer should take only one meal in the noon, on the 14th after finishing his usual morning duties and rites, he should make a saṅkalpa in the morning with a mantra 'I shall perform this Śivarātrivrata that yields great rewards; O Lord of the world! may it be without obstacles through your favour. On the 14th I shall be without food and shall take my meal on the next day for enjoyment of pleasures and _mokṣa_, O Lord! be you my refuge.' If the performer be a brāhmaṇa, he should recite the two ṛk verses[^598] 'rātrim prapadye' and cast water. In the evening (of 14th ) he should take a bath with black sesame, should apply the _tripuṇḍra_ mark[^599] with ashes to his forehead and also hold a rosary of _rudrākṣa_ ( berry of Elaeocarpus Ganitrus), should go to a temple of Śiva at the beginning of night, should wash his feet, should take _ācamana_ (should sip water) and should make a saṅkalpa 'I shall perform the pūjā of the first watch on Śivaratri'; if he intends to perform separate pūjās on all the four watches or if he wants to perform a pūjā only once he should say 'I shall perform the worship of Śiva on Śivarātri for securing the favour of Śiva.'

[^598]: The मन्त्रs are verses 3 and 4 of the रात्रीसूक्त, which is a खिलसूक्त after ऋग्वेद X. 127, viz. रात्रीं प्रपद्ये जननीं० and संवेशिनीं संयमनीं०.

[^599]: _Tripuṇḍra_ - is triple sectarian mark consisting of three lines on the forehead.

## Procedure of Śivarātrivrata

Then he should repeat the sage (Vāmadeva) of the Śiva mantra of five letters (_Śivāya namaḥ_), the metre (Anusṭup ), the Devatā ( Sadāśiva) and it is to be employed for _nyāsa_, _pūjā_ and _japa_. Then he should bow to the sage, metre and Sadāśiva and perform _nyāsa_ on the several parts of the body from the heart with appropriate mystic letters and mantras (such as 'om namas-tat-puruṣāya namaḥ hṛdaye' to the last '_om yam astrāya phat_'); then he should worship the jar (_kalaśa_) and contemplate on Śiva as portrayed [^600] in the verse quoted below. He should then establish a liṅga by performing the _prāṇapratiṣṭhā_ and touch it and should invoke [^601] Śiva with four mantras and pray Śiva to be present in the liṅga till the end of the pūjā. Then he should offer an _añjali_ of flowers. If the liṅga is already permanently fixed or if the liṅga, though not fixed, has already been established with the necessary saṁskāras, he should omit the details from prāṇapratisthā to _āvāhana_. Then he should perform the remaining upacāras (out of 16 ) from _āsana_ to the last. As regarde snāna it is provided that the liṅga is to be bathed with pañcāmṛta ( vide note [^218] ), with the _mūlamantra_ (Śivāya namaḥ ) and the mantras 'āpyāyasva' R̥g. I. 91. 16 ff) and should wash it with pure water with - the three verses 'āpo hi ṣṭhā' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). Then he should perform _abhiṣeka_ (bathing of the deity ) with water made fragrant with sandalwood, saffron and camphor to the accompaniment of the Rudra mantras[^602] recited once or repeated eleven times and of the Puruṣasūkta (R̥g. X. 90). At the end of snāna ( of the liṅga ) the performer should give _ācamana_ water ( to the liṅga ) and perform tarpaṇa with water mixed with akṣatas for Śiva with eight names (Bhava[^603] &c.) and the wives of these eight.

[^600]: ध्यायेन्नित्यं महेशं रजतगिरिनिभं चारुचन्द्रावतंसं रत्नाकल्पोज्ज्वलाङ्गं परशुमृगवराभीतिहस्तं प्रसन्नम् । पद्मासीनं समन्तात्स्तुतममरगणैर्व्याघ्रकृत्तिं वसानं विश्वाद्यं विश्ववन्द्यं निखिलभयहरं पञ्चवक्त्रं त्रिनेत्रम् ॥ q. by धर्मसिन्धु p. 127.

[^602]: Rudra means the eleven _anuvākas_ of the Tai. S, IV. 5. 1-11 beginning with 'namas-te Rudra Manyave'.

[^603]: The eight names are Bhava, Śarva, iśāna, Paśupati, Ugra, Rudra, Bhima, Mahādeva, The form will be 'om Bhavam devam tarpayāmi' &c. Aad as to the wives, 'Bhavasya devasya patnim tarpayāmi'. For eight names of Rudra almost identical with these, vide Śaṅkhyāyana brāhmaṇa VI, 2-9.


After flowers the performer should offer 1008 or 108 bilva leaves with the thousand names of Śiva'[^604] or with mūlamantra. After _naivedya_ he should offer ācamana and fruits with _mūlamantra_. After _tāmbūla_ he should wave a lamp ( before the liṅga) with the mūlamantra and Vedic mantras, offer _mantrapuṣpa_ with the mantra 'om namaḥ Śivāya' and offer eight namaskāras to the eight names 'Bhava' &c. ( quoted in note [^603]) and to their wives. Then he should offer twelve añjalis of flowers with the twelve names [^605] ( noted below ), perform _pradakṣiṇā_ and _namaskāras_ with mūlamantra, repeat inaudibly the mūlamantra 108 times, should pray for forgiveness and should declare ( before liṅga) 'May Samba Sadāśiva be pleased with this pūjā'.

If a man undertook a vrata to observe Śivarātri for 24 or 14 years or 12 years he has to perform the udyāpana thereof at the end of that period. [^606] An elaborate procedure is prescribed in some works such as the Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi (pp. 258,259), Vratarāja pp. 586-587. It is passed over here.

As regards the pāraṇā on a single Śivarātri on Māghakr̥ṣṇa the texts, as noted by Nirṇayasindhu, are in conflict. Two of them from the Skanda may be set out here [^607]. 'Kr̥ṣṇāṣṭamī, Skandaṣaṣṭhi and Śivarātri, when these are mixed with the preceding and following tithis, the one mixed with the preceding tithi should be accepted for the prescribed rite and the pāraṇā should be performed at the end of the tithi prescribed; fast on 14th and pāraṇā on the 14th itself — such an occurrence may be had only if one has lakhs of good deeds to one's credit'.

[^604]: अनुशासन (17.31-153) gives the 1008 names of Śiva and शान्तिपर्व (285. 74 ff) mentions most of the 1008 names.

[^605]: The 12 names are शिव, रुद्र, पशुपति, नीलकण्ठ, महेश्वर, हरिकेश, विरूपाक्ष, पिनाकिन् , त्रिपुरान्तक, शम्भु, शूलिन् , महादेव.

(on काल p. 298), the. 2nd is q. by धर्मसिन्धु p. 126.

## Pāraṇā on śivarātrivrata

The conclusions established by the Dharmasindhu p. 126 are; 'If caturdaśī tithi ends before three watches of the night end, then the pāraṇā should be at the end of the (14th ) tithi: if caturdaśī ( tithi) extends beyond the three watches of the night, then at daybreak the pāraṇā takes place in the midst of the 14th; these are the views of Mādhava and others; the opinion of the Nirṇayasindhu is that even when the caturdaśi tithi ends before the three watches of the night the pāraṇā must be observed in the midst of the caturdaśī and not at the end of caturdaśī.

In modern times very few, if at all, go through the procedure prescribed even in the Dharmasindhu. A fast is observed and Śiva is worshipped and people may listen to stories of Śiva's exploits. Common people in some parts drink a beverage called _bhāng_ prepared by pouring water on crushed hemp leaves with the addition of almonds, rose leaves, opium seeds &c. It is supposed to be dear to Śhaṅkara. In many temples of Śiva, water is made to drip on the liṅga incessantly.

Mr. Gupte (pp. 208–215 ) after detailing the story of a hunter and a doe, her mate buck and two young ones connects the Śivarātri observances with the constellation of Mṛgaśirṣa together with Sirius (the Hunter), but he is at a loss to explain why the 14th of Māgha-kṛṣṇa should have been selected for a fast. Mr. Mukerji (pp. 33-37 ) contents himself by referring to the Śivarātrimāhātmya in Śantiparva. The constellation of Mṛgaśirṣa and the brightest star Sirius had attracted the minds of ancient Indians. The Ait. Br. (XIII, 9 )[^608] narrates how Prajapati seeking his own daughter for intercourse sinned, how he assumed the form of an antelope and how the gods brought together their terrible forms, which became Rudra whom they asked to pierce the antelope. When Rudra pierced the antelope, the latter fled up into the sky. People call it Mṛga ( Mṛgaśirṣa ) and Rudra became the hunter ( Mṛgavyādha), the daughter became Rohiṇī and the arrow (with its three parts ) became the three arrow-like stars.

In the Lingapurāṇa as quoted in the Vratarāja ( pp. 573– 586 ) there is the story of a hunter (niṣāda ) who when bent on killing a doe, her mate and children unknowingly performed all the characteristic actions of Śivarātrivrata and who and the family of the buck ultimately became transformed into the Mṛgaśirṣa nakṣatra with the star of the hunter (Sirius) behind[^609].

For detailed treatment of Śivarātrivrata in the medieval digests, H. V. II. 71-122, V. R. R. 72-77, T. T. 124-133, SmK. 481-512, P.C. 248-281, G. K. 158-167 may be consulted.
