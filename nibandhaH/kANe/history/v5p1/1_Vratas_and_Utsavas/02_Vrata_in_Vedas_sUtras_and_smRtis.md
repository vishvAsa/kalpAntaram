VRATA in Vedic Literature, Sūtras and Smr̥tis ; definition and importance of Vratas.

After dealing with the etymology and semantic development of the word 'vrata' from the passages of the Ṛgveda in which the word occurs, it is now time to tarn to the other Vedic Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas for finding out how that word is dealt with in them. Some of the Ṛgvedic verses occur in other Vedic Samhitās. In several such passages vrata appears to mean 'divine ordinances' or 'ethical patterns of conduct'. For example, the verse[^35] Ṛg. I. 22. 19 'Mark the deeds of Viṣṇu, the helpful friend of Indra, whereby he watches over his ordinances' occurs also in T. S. I. 3.6.2, Atharva VII. 26.6, Vāj. S. VI. 4; Ṛg. VIII. 11. 136 'O Agni! thou art a God that protects ordinances among (gods and) men, thou art to be praised in sacrifices' is also found in Atharva 19. 59. 1, Vāj. S. IV. 16, T.S. I. 1. 14. 4-5 and I. 2.3.1; Ṛg. I. 24.15 is found in Vāj. S. XII. 12 and Atharva VII. 83 (88) 3 and XVIII, 4. 69; Ṛg. X. 191. 3 is almost the same as Atharva[^37] VI. 64.2, the latter substituting the word 'vratam' for 'manaḥ' in the former and thereby indicating that 'vrata' means 'resolve to undertake a religious observance'; Ṛg. VII. 103. 1, in which frogs that lie down silent for a year and begin to croak at the advent of the rains are compared to brāhmaṇas observing a religious vow, occurs in the Atharvaveda IV. 15. 13; Ṛg. X. 12. 5 is the same as Atharva XVIII. 1. 33; Ṛg. X. 2.4 is almost the same as Atharva XIX. 59.2; Ṛg. I. 84. 12 is equal to Atharva XX. 109. 3; in all of which the words _vratam_ and _vratāni_ occur. Agni is frequently called 'vratapāḥ' in the Ṛgveda (V. 2.8, VI. 8.%, VIII. 11. 1, X. 32.6) and also Sūrya is so called (Ṛg. I. 83.5.). In the other Samhitās Agni is styled ‘vratapā' as well as 'vratapati' (protector or lord of vratas). Atharva XX. 25.5 (Sūryo vratapā) is the same as Ṛg. I. 83.5, Atharva XIX. 59.1 (tvam-Agne vratapā asi) is same as Ṛg. VIII. 11.1; Vaj. S. I. 5.[^38] says 'O Agni, lord of vratas! I shall undertake a religious observance (or obligation).

[^35]: विष्णोः कर्माणि पश्यत यतो व्रतानि पस्पशे। इन्द्रस्य युज्यः सखा॥ ऋ. I. 22. 19.
[^36]: त्वमग्ने व्रतपा असि देव आ मर्त्येष्वा। त्वं यज्ञेष्वीड्यः। ऋ  VIII. 11. 1. The पदपाठ reads देवः; but it is possible to read the word as देवे (meaning देवेषु).
[^37]: समानो मन्त्रः समितिः समानी समानं व्रतं सह चित्तमेषाम्। अथर्व VI. 64. 2.
[^38]: व्रतमुपैष्यन् ब्रूयादग्ने व्रतपते व्रतं चरिष्यामीति । तै. सं. I. 6. 7.2; अग्ने व्रतपते व्रतं चरिष्यामि तच्छकेयं तन्मे राध्यताम् । इदमहमनृतात्सत्यमुपैमि। वाज. सं. I. 5; अग्ने व्रतपते व्रतमचारिषं तदशकं तन्मेऽराधीदमहं य एवास्मि सोऽस्मि । वाज. सं. II. 28; अग्ने व्रतपते त्वं व्रतानां व्रतपतिरसि । तै. सं. I. 3 4.3; व्रतेन त्वं व्रतपते समक्तो विश्वाहा सुमना दीदिहीह । अथर्व VII. 74 (78). 4; vide शतपथ I. 1. 1. 2 which quotes वाज. सं. I. 5 and II. 28.

Vrata in other Samhitās

 May I be able to carry it out, may that (undertaking) of mine succeed; here do I approach truth from untruth'. The T. S. I. 3.4.3 also styles Agni 'vratapati'. Here and there Vedic Saṃhitaś other than the Ṛgveda do employ the word 'vrata' in the sense of 'ordin ances of a god or of gods' as in T. S. IV. 3. 11.1,2,3 or Atharva VII. 40 (41). 1, VII. 68 (70). 1 ('Sarasvati vratesu te'). But in many places in all the Samhitās (other than the Ṛgveda) and in the Brāhmaṇas and Upanisads generally the ordinary senses of vrata are two, viz. (1) religious observance of vow, or restrictions as to food and behaviour when one has undertaken a religious vow, or (2) the special food, that is prescribed for sustenance when a person is engaged in a religious rite or undertaking, such as cow's milk, _yavāgū_. (barley gruel) or the mixture of hot milk and curds (called āmikṣā). Both meanings of vrata are given by Yāska in his Nirukta[^39]. A few passages from the Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas are cited below to illustrate both meanings. For the first meaning, vide the following: T. S. II. 5.5.6 'this[^40] is his vrata (vow); he should not speak what is untrue, should not eat flesh, should not approach a woman (for sexual intercourse), nor should his apparel be washed with water impregnated with cleansing salt; for, all these things the gods do not do'; T. S. V.7.6.1[^41] birds are indeed fire; when one who has performed Agnicayana eats the (flesh of) birds, he would be eating fire and would meet with disaster (or distress); (therefore) he should observe this vrata (not to eat bird's flesh) for a year,


[^39]:  <u>व्रतमिति कर्मनाम </u> निवृत्तिकर्म वारयतीति सतः । इदमपीतरद्व्रतमेतस्मादेव वृणोतीति सतः । <u>अन्नमपि व्रतमुच्यत</u> । यदावृणोति शरीरम् । निरुक्त II. 14.
[^40]: तस्यैतद् व्रतम् । नानृतं वदेन्न मांसमश्नीयान्न स्त्रियमुपेयान्नास्य पल्पूलनेन वासः पल्पूलयेयुरेतद्धि देवाः सर्वे न कुर्वन्ति । तै. सं. II. 5. 5. 6.
[^41]: वयो वाग्निर्यदग्निचित् पक्षिणोश्नीयात् तमेवाग्निमद्यादातिसृच्छेत् संवत्सरं व्रतं चरेत्संवत्सरं हि व्रतं नाति । ते. सं. V. 7. 6. 1.

for vrata does not extend beyond a year'. The śānkhayana [^42] Br. VI. 6 prescribes 'He has to observe the vrata, viz. that he should not see the rising sun nor the setting sun'. The Tai. Ā. I. 26.6 states "this is the vrata for him (for him who has per formed Āruṇaketuka-cayana), viz. he should not run while it is raining, should not urinate or void ordure in water, should not spit, should not bathe naked, should not step over lotus leaves or gold, should not eat (the flesh) of a tortoise'.

The Bṛhadāranyakopaniṣad (I. 5. 21-23) remarks "now begins the consideration about vrata; Prajāpati indeed created the organs, which when created, vied with each other; speech stood fast (by the view) 'I shall only speak' (and do nothing else).'... Therefore one should perform only one vrata, viz. one should only breathe in and should emit breath, for fear that otherwise (if one were to engage in the activities of the other organs) wicked Death may seize him”:[^43] It is stated in the Tai. Up. III. 7-10 'one should not speak ill of food; that is the vrata, ...one should not shun food, that is the vrata...one should prepare much food...one should not refuse residence to a man whatever (when he comes as a stranger seeking shelter), that is the vrata; therefore one should secure plenty of food by some method or other.'[^44] In the Chāndogyopaniṣad (adhyāya II, khandas 13-21) the words 'tad vratam' occur several times in relation to the injunctions when one is engaged in the _upāsanā_ of several _Sāmans_ not to complain about the hot sun, raining cloud, seasons, _lokas_ (worlds), domestic animals, brāhmaṇas and the injunction not to eat marrow for a year (or not to eat it at all).


[^42]: तस्य व्रतमुद्यन्तमेवैनं नेक्षेतास्तं यन्तं चेति। शां. व्रा. VI. 6. जै. IV. 1. 3 refers to this text and Śabara remarks that these are प्रजापतिव्रतs, that they are पुरुषार्थ and not ऋत्वर्थ and that this text lays down a restriction that one should make a resolve not to see the rising or setting sun. आप. घ. सू. I. 11.31.20 (उद्यन्त्मस्तं यन्तं चादित्यं दर्शने वर्जयेत्),मनु 4, 37, वसिष्ठधर्मसूत्र XII. 10-12 make this and other rules applicable to all स्नातकs.

[^43]: अथातो व्रतमीमांसा। प्रजापतिई कर्माणि ससजे तानि सृष्टाम्यन्योन्येनास्पर्धन्त वदिप्याम्येवाहमिति वाग्दत्रे।... तस्मादेकमेव प्रतं चरेत्प्राण्याच्चैवापान्याच्च नेन्मा पाप्मा मृत्युराप्न वदति। वृह. उप. I. 5. 21-23. This passage is the basis of देवान्तसूत्र III, 3.43.

[^44]: अन्नं न निन्द्यात्। तद् व्रतम्। ... अन्नं बहु कुर्वीत तद्व्रतम्।... न क्ंचन वसतो प्रत्यचक्षीत। तद् व्रतम्। तस्माद्यया कया च विधय बहन्नं प्रामुयात्। तै. उ. III. (सुगुवल्ली ). 7-10.

Meaning of vrata

A few passages from the Vedic Literature may be cited for the second meaning of vrata (food for sustenance &c.) mentioned above. The T. S. (VI. 2. 5. 1.) remarks[^45] 'he (dīkṣita) observes the vrata taking the milk from one udder, then from two udders, then from three, then from four; this is called _kṣurapavi_ (razor-edge) vrata; barley gruel is the vrata of a ksatriya (when dīkṣita), āmiksā (hot milk and curds mixed) of a vaiśya.' The Śatapatha Br. provides [^46] that a dīksita (one who has undergone the consecration ceremony for a vedic sacrifice) should subsist on milk. In another place the Śatapatha says ‘for him he heats _vrata_' (i.e. the food or milk). The Ait. Br. also provides[^47] that the dīksita first takes (the milk) from four udders as vrata on the Upasad days, then from three &c. Vide T. A. II. 8 [^48] milk is the vrata of a brāhmaṇa (sacrificer); _yavāgū_ of a kṣatriya and āmiksā of a vaiśya.

It appears that in the times of the Brāhmaṇas the word. vrata ' had come to have two secondary senses derived from the sense of religious observance or obligation'; viz. 'a proper course or pattern of conduct for a person', and 'an upavāsa' i.e. the sacrificer's staying at night near Gārhapatya fire or fasting. As illustrative of the first may be cited a passage that occurs towards the end of the Ait. Br. viz. 'this is the _vrata_ for him (for the king who has performed what is called 'brahmaṇaḥ parimaraḥ') that he should not sit down before his enemy sits down (but should do so after), if he thinks (from information received) that his enemy is standing the king should also stand up; he should not lie down before his enemy (does so); if the king thinks that (the enemy) has sat down he may then himself sit down; he should never sleep before his enemy sleeps; if he thinks that the enemy is awake he should himself keep awake; even if the enemy has his head as hard as a stone (or has a stone helmet on his head), he (the king who performs the _parimara_) quickly overthrows him'.[^49]


[^45]: अथैकं स्तनं व्रतमुपैत्यथ द्वावथ त्रीनथ चतुर एतद्वै क्षुरपवि नाम वतं...यवागू राजन्यस्य व्रतं ... आमिक्षा वैश्यस्य पयो ब्रह्मणस्य  ...तै. सं. VI. 2. 3. 1-3. क्षुरपवि occurs in अथर्व XII. 5. 20 and 55.

[^46]: अथातः पयोव्रततायै। पयोव्रतो दीक्षितः स्यात्। शतपथ IX. 5. 1. 1; अथास्मै व्रतं श्रपयति... अथास्मै व्रतं प्रयच्छति। शतपथ III. 2. 2 10 and 16.

[^47]: चतुरोग्ने स्तनान्व्रतमुपैत्युपसत्सु... त्रीन् स्तनान् व्रतमुपैति...।ऐ. षा I. 25. 4, For उपसद् vide H. of Dh, vol. II pp. 1151-52. On the first day of upasad in the evening the milk of all four udders is to be used by the sacrificer, of three on the 2nd day in the morning, of two in the evening of 2nd day and of one udder on 3rd day morning.

[^48]: पयो ब्रह्मणस्य व्रतं यवागू राजन्यस्यामिक्षा वैश्यस्य। तै. आ. II. 8. This passage is the subject matter of Jaimini IV. 3. 8-9 and VI. 8. 28. The sentence preceding पयो व्रतं &c. is 'न मांसमश्र्नीयान्न् स्त्रियमुपेयान्नोपर्यासीत जुमुप्सेतानृतात्।'. Compare तै.सं. VI. 2. 5. 2-3.

[^49]:तस्य व्रतम् । न द्विषतः पूर्व उपविशेद्यदि तिष्ठन्तं मन्येत तिष्ठेतैव न द्विषतः पूर्वः संविशेद्यद्यासीनं मन्येतासीतैव न द्विषतः पूर्वः प्रस्त्रप्याद्यदि जाग्रतं मन्येत जाग्रियादेवापि ह यद्यस्याश्ममूर्धा द्विषन्भवति क्षिप्रं हैवनं स्तृणुते । ऐ. प्रा. VIII. 28.
 H.D. 4





The other secondary meaning of _vrata_ seems to be _upavāsa_ (i.e. Yajamāna's passing the night in the Darśa-isti and the Pūrṇamāsa-iśṭi near the Gārhapatya and other fires, or reducing his intake of food or fasting): " that he performs _upavāsa_ in Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa iśṭis is so because the gods do not partake of the offering made by one who has not undergone _vrata_; therefore he undergoes upavāsa with the thought 'the gods may partake of my offering'" (Ait. Br. VII. II )[^50]

Coming to the Śrautasūtras,[^51] the two principal meanings of vrata mentioned above often figure in them. For example, the Āp. Śr. S. IV. 2. 5-7, IV. 16. 11, V. 7. 6 and 16, V. 8. 1, V. 25. 2-20, IX. 3. 15, XI. 1. 7 and IX. 18. 9, Āśv. Śr. S. II. 2. 7, III. 13. 1-2, Śān. Śr. S. II. 3. 26 may be referred to for the first meaning and Āp. Śr. S. X. 12. 4, X. 17.6, XI. 15. 3 and 6 for the second (viz. food or milk &c.). The Gṛhyasūtras and Dharamasūtras also present the same meaning of vrata. For sample, the Āśv. Gr. III. 10. 5-7 states : these are the vratas for him, viz. he should not bathe at night, nor bathe naked, nor run while it is raining


[^50]: तदाहुर्यदर्शपूर्णमासयोरुपवसति न ह षा अव्रतस्य देवा हविरश्नन्ति तस्मादुपवसत्युत मे देवा हविरश्नीयुरिति। ऐ. व्रा. VII. 11 (or 32. 9). The शां. ब्रा. III. I has the same words. The ते सं I. 6. 7.3 appears to refer to both these significances of upavasa 'उपास्मिञ्छ्वो यक्ष्यमाणे देवता वसन्ति य एवं विद्वानग्निमुपस्तृणाति ... यदना श्वानुपवसेपितृदेवत्यः स्यात् ।'. सायण explains on ऐ. ब्रा 'गार्हपत्यादिसमीपे यो वासः स उपवासः। यद्वा देवा अस्यापि यज्ञे समीपे वसन्तीत्येतदीयोनुष्ठानसङ्कल्प उपवासः। ... यद्वा ग्राम्याशनपरित्याग उपवासः। तत्परित्यज्यारण्याशनरूपं नियनं स्वीकुर्यात् । अनाश्वान् is m.nom. sing. of अनाश्वस् (one who has not eaten, one who is fasting).

[^51]: A few of these passages may be set out here: दक्षिणेनाहवनीयमवस्थाय व्रतमुपैष्यन्समुद्रं मनसा ध्यायति। अथ जपत्यग्ने व्रतं चरिष्यामीति ब्राह्मणः। वायो व्रतपत आदित्य व्रतपते व्रतानां व्रतपते व्रतं चरिष्यामीति राजन्यवैश्यो। आप. श्रौ. IV. 3. 1-23 अथ व्रतं चरति न मांसमश्नाति स्त्रियमुपैति नास्याग्निं गृहाद्धरन्ति नान्यत आहरान्ति। योस्याग्निमाधास्यन् स्यात् स एतां रात्रिं व्रतं चरति न मांसमश्नाति न स्त्रियमुपैति । आप. श्रौ. V.7.6 and 16; अत ऊर्ध्वमाहिताग्निव्रतचार्या होमात्। आश्व.  श्रौ II. 2.7; आहिताग्निर्व्रते नानिष्ट्वा पशुना मांसमश्नीयादनिष्ट्वाग्रयणेन  नवानामोषधीनां फलानि । शां. श्रौ. II. 3. 26. As to the second meaning of व्रत (food, milk &c ) vide आप श्रौ. x. 17.6 गार्हपत्ये दीक्षितस्य व्रतं श्रपयति दक्षिणाग्नौ पत्न्याः। अत्रैकस्तनं व्रतं यजमानाय प्रयच्छति आप. श्रो.XI. 15.6,

Meaning of vrata in sūtras

27

&c.; the Pār. Gṛ. II. 8 says that the _snātaka_ has to follow for three days after _samavartani_ certain observances such as not eating flesh, not using earthen vessels for drinking water, not seeing women, sūdras, corpses and crows, not speaking with Śūdras, not urinating nor voiding ordure nor spitting in front of the sun, or he should simply speak the truth (instead of observing the other requirements of this passage). Gautama (VIII. 15), Śāṇkhāyana-gṛhya (II. 11-12), Gobhila-gṛhya (III. 1. 26-31 ) and others mention certain _vratas_ (now obsolete) which every Vedic student was to undergo. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 370–373 for descriptions of these. The Ap. Dh. S. H. 1.1.1 ff specifies[^52] the observances to be followed by the husband and wife from the day of their marriage such as eating only twice in the day, not eating to satiety, fasting on _parvan_ days. Similarly, the Āp. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 6, I. 11. 31 ) sets out the observances for _snātakas_ (atha snātaka-vratāni). Pāṇini has a special sūtra 'vrate' (III. 2. 80 ) for explaining the formation of words from _vrata_ with the affix _in_ (ṇini) preceded by a substantive such as 'sthaṇḍilaśāyin' and 'aśrāddha-bhoji' (one who has taken the vow of not partaking of śrāddha food). Pāṇini (III. 1. 21 )[^53] also teaches the formation of a denominative verb from vrata in the sense of doing' (_vratuyati vratam karoti_). It is the Kāśikā that adda a _vārtıka_ (absent in the Mahābhāṣya) that the verb so derived expresses both the eating of food and the eschewing of it.

As prāyaścittas (expiations) involved the observance of several strict rules they came to be called vratas in Manu (XI. 117, 170,176,181), Yājñavalkya (III. 251, 252, 254, 258), Saṅkha (17.6, 22, 42, 61, 62 ) and other smṛtis. In the Mahābhārata the word _vrata_ is mainly used in the sense of a religious undertaking or vow in which one has to observe certain restrictions about food or one's general behaviour. Vide Vanaparva 296. 3, Udyoga 39. 71-72, Śānti 35.39, Anuśāsana 103. 34. It was also applied in the epic to a course or pattern of conduct or behaviour not necessarily religious. For example, in the Sabhāparva 58. 16 Yudhisthira says that it has been his constant vow that he would not refuse dice-play when he was challenged to it.[^54]

[^52]: पाणिग्रहणादधि गृहमेधिनोर्व्रतम्। कालयोर्भोजनम् । अतृप्तिश्वान्नस्य। पर्वसु चोभयोरुपवासः। आप.ध.सू. II. 1. 1-4.

[^53]: मुण्डमिश्रश्र्लक्ष्णलवणव्रतवस्त्रहलकलकृततूस्तेम्यो णिच्। पा. III. 1. 21; व्रताभ्दो जन-तन्निवृत्तौ च । पयो व्रतयति वृषलास्नं व्रतयति। काशिका.

[^54]: आहूतोहं न निवर्ते कदाचित्तदाहितं शाश्वतं वै व्रतं मे। सभापर्व  58. 16.





Apart from the secondary applications of the word vrata, its principal meaning from at least the first centuries of the Christian era onwards has been that of a religious undertaking or yow, observed on a certain tithi, week day, month or other period, for securing some desired object by the worship of a deity, usually accompanied by restrictions as to food and behaviour. This is the sense in which the word _vrata_ will be used in this section. Vratas may be expiatory (i. e. they will be prāyaścittas) or obligatory (such as the vratas of a brahmacārin or snātaka or householder) or they may be voluntary and self-imposed for securing some specific end. Expiatory vratas have already been dealt with in the 4th volume of the H. of Dh. under Prāyaścittas. The vratas of a brahmacārin, of snātaka and of the householder have been treated of in volume II of the H. of Dh. Vratas or vows that are more or less self-imposed will be discussed in this section of the 5th volume.

Vows are found in all religions. The Old Testament and the New Testament both bear witness to the sacredness of vows, vide Isaiah 19.21, Job 22.27, Psalms 22. 25, Acts 21. 23. The Jainas have five great vows and the Buddhists have the pañca-śīlas.

A great deal of discussion is found in the medieval digests on a comprehensive definition of vrata. Śabara[^55] on Jai. VI. 2. 20 arrives at the conclusion that by vrata is meant a mental activity, which is a resolve in the form “I shall not do this" and gives as an illustration the sentence 'one should not see the rising or setting sun'. Medhātithi on Manu IV. 13 seems to accept this. The Agnipurāṇa[^56] provides 'a restrictive rule declared by the śāstras is called vrata, which is also regarded as _tapas_; restraint of senses and other rules are but special incidents of vrata; vrata is called _tapas_ because it causes hardship to the performer (of the vrata) and it is also called _niyama_ since therein one has to restrain the several organs of sense'. Manu II. 3

[^55]: तस्य व्रतमिति प्रकृत्य प्रजापतिव्रतानि समाग्नातानि । व्रतमिति च मानसं कर्मोच्यते <u>इदं न करिष्यामीति यः सङ्कल्पः ।</u> कतमत् तद् व्रतम् । नोद्यन्तमादित्यमीक्षेतेति । यथा तदीक्षणं न भवति तथा मानसो व्यापारः कर्तव्यः।तस्य पालनम्। शबर on जै. VI. 2. 20; मानसः सङ्कल्पो व्रतमुच्यते । शास्त्रविहितमिदं मया कर्तव्यमिदं वा न कर्तव्यमित्येवम् । मेधा on मनु IV. 13 (व्र्तानीमानि धारयेत्).

[^56]: शास्त्रोदितो हि नियमो व्रतं तञ्च तपो मतम् । नियमास्तु विशेषास्तु व्रतस्यैव दमादयः । व्रतं हि कर्तृसन्तापात्तप इत्यभिधीयते । इन्द्रियग्रामनियमान्नियमश्चाभिधीयते ॥ अग्निपुराण 175. 2-3. The first verse is also गरुडपुराण I. 128. 1.

Definition of vrata

declares[^57] ' resolve is the root of desires, of sacrifices, of vratas and the characteristics called _yamas_-all are known to spring from resolve'. But every _saṅkalpa_ entertained by any person whatever is not and cannot be called vrata. It may be noted that the Amarakośa holds[^58] that the words 'niyama'and 'vrata'are synonyms and that the latter consists of fast and the like that produce merit (_punya_), while the Āp. Dh. S. I. 2, 57 remarks that the word _tapas_ is applied to the rules of conduct prescribed for a brahmacārin (' niyameṣu tapahśabdaḥ'). The Mitākṣarā[^59] on Yāj. I. 129 appears to indicate that vrata is a mental resolve to do something or refrain from doing something, both being enjoined as duties. It is therefore that Srīdatta (probably taking his cue from Sabara and the Mit.) in his Samaya-pradīpa defines vrata as 'a definite resolve relating to a certain matter held as obligatory' and proceeds to lay down that it may be positive (being in the form 'I must do it') or negative (I must not do this'). He further holds that a resolve[^60] made with the addition of a condition not enjoined by śāstras is not a vrata: 0. g. if a man were to declare that he would observe a fast if his father would not forbid it and that otherwise he would not, this would not be a vrata and that, since _saṅkalpa_ is the principal matter in a vrata, if a man of weak intellect or an ignorant man observes a fast without saṅkalpa, it would be simply so much physical hardship but no vrata.

[^57]: सङ्कल्पमूलः कामो वै यज्ञाः सङ्कल्पसम्भवाः । व्रतानि यमधर्माश्च सर्वे सङ्कल्पजाः स्मताः । मनु II. 3. या. III. 312-313 mention ten _yamas_ (ब्रह्मचर्य, दया. अहिंसा. दम &c ) and ten niyamas (such as स्नान, मौन, उपवास, शौच &c.), while the योगसूत्र mentions only five यमs (अहिंसासत्यास्तेयब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः) and five नियमs (शौचसन्तोषतपास्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः). मनु IV. 204 and Atri verse 47 provide that one must observe yamas always (i e. they are para. mount duties), while niyamas are not so. The वायुपुराण (16. 17-19) enumerates a large number of नियमs (and includes अहिंसा, अस्तेय and ब्रह्मचर्य under them ). The एकादशीतत्त्व after quoting मनु II. 3 explains 'अनेन कर्मणा इदमिष्टं फलं साध्यते इत्येवंविषया बुद्धिः सङ्कल्पस्तदनन्तरमिष्टसाधनतया अवगते तस्मिन् इच्छा जायते ततस्तदर्थ प्रयत्नं कुर्वीत इत्येवं यज्ञाः सङ्कल्पसम्भवाः ।'.

 The Kr̥tyaratnākara[^61] mentions several definitions of vrata given by its predecessors, one of which by Deveśvara was that 'a vrata is that which is included in the vratakānda'. This last is a desperate effort at definition and leaves the inquirer hardly wiser than before. That saṅkalpa is closely connected with vrata cannot be gainsaid and follows from a verse of Laghu-Viṣṇu[^62] 'the choosing of _ṛtviks_ is the starting point of a sacrifice, _saṅkalpa_ that of _vrata_ and of a _japa_ of mantras (in honour of a deity)'. Sūlapāṇi defined vrata on almost the same lines as Sridatta. Laksmidhara in his Kr̥tyakalpataru on vrata does not define vrata but begins his treatment of vrata with vratapraśamsā. Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar in his Introduction to the Vratakāṇda of the Kr̥tyakalpataru remarks (p. XXIII) 'Raghunandana in his Vrata-tattva also avoids any attempt to define vrata'. Prof. Aiyangar did not notice that Raghunandana discusses the question of the definition of vrata in his Ekādaśī tattva (Jiv. vol. II. p. 7) and therefore he did not repeat the definition in the Vratatattva. Raghunandana mentions[^63] the definitions of vrata given by Nārāyana and Sridatta, does not agree that vrata is a saṅkalpa but holds that vrata means various rites about which a resolve is made and also that vrata is a _niyama_ (a restrictive rule ) enjoined by the śāstra, charac terised by _upavāsa_ and the like and not every niyama such as 'ṛtukālābhigāmi syāt' (Yāj. I. 79, Manu III. 45). The Vrataprakāśa (a part of Viramitrodaya) defines vrata as 'a special saṅkalpa concerning what is well known to the learned as vrata,' just as _mantras_ are those that are well-known among the learned as mantras[^64].

Definition of vrata

31

The Dharmasindhu (p. 9) defines vrata as a kind of religious rite consisting of _pūja_ and the like. Although at the root of every vrata and as an urge for it, there must be a saṅkalpa it appears to me that Raghunandana and the Dharmasindhu properly represent the popular meaning of vrata. A vrata comprehends several items such as snāna (bath), the morning prayer (prātaḥ-sandhyā), _saṅkalpa_, _homa_, _pūjā_ of the deity or deities in whose honour or for securing whose favour the vrata is undertaken, upavāsa, feeding of brāhmanas, maidens or married women or the poor and helpless (according to the nature of the vrata), gifts (of cows, money, apparel, sweetmeats &c.) and the observance of certain rules of conduct during the period of the vrata. Some of these matters will be dealt with in detail later on, but a few may be disposed off here. Some writers relying on Śatātapa said that before a vrata was undertaken a Viddhi-śrāddha must be performed[^65]. The Agnipurāṇa (175. 12) states[^66] that one who undertakes a vrata must always take a bath (every day), should subsist on a limited quantity of food, should worship and honour his _guru_, gods and brāhmaṇas and should eschew ksāra, ksaudra, lavaṇa, honey and meat. Devala states[^67] without partaking of food (the previous night), after bathing and concentrating one's mind, one should, after invoking the Sun and other deities to be present, commence a vrata in the morning'. The general tendency of medieval writers to go on adding details to what was originally brief is seen at work here also.

There is no agreement about the meaning of ksāra and lavana Vide H. of Dh, vol. II, 304 note 723 for the several meanings and अग्निषु 175. 13-14; _madhu_ and _kṣaudra_ are often used as synonyms. Here kṣaudra may be taken as honey collected from bee-bives and madhu as not so collected.

This is बृहद्योगियाज्ञवल्क्य VII. 33 'ध्यायेन्नारायणं देवंं नित्यं स्नानादिकर्मसु ।'





The Vratakālaviveka says that before saṇkalpa, there should be remembrance of Nārāyana and namaskāra to him, as laid down by Yogiyājñavalkya. There is difference of opinion about the worship of Ganeśa[^68]. The Vratakālaviveka quotes the Padmapurāṇa for the order in which the several deities are to be worshipped and honoured after _saṅkalpa_ and refutes the idea that the worship of Ganeśa should always precede the worship of other deities. Though the general rule is that[^69] the _saṅkalpa_ of a vrata is to be made in the morning, still there are some passages to the contrary. For example, the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa[^70] (Uttara 11. 6-8) provides that on the evening of Āṣāḍha Full Moon one should declare a resolve as follows 'from tomorrow for one month in Srāvana, I shall take a bath, observe _braḥmacarya_, take one meal only after evening, sleep on the ground, will be compassionate to all living beings'.

There is a difference between _homa_ and _pūja_. A homa with Vedic mantras, according to ancient authorities, cannot be performed by women and śūdras. Though theoretically the three varṇas were entitled to perform homa with Vedic mantras some learned brāhmaṇas held the view that in the _Kaliyuga_ no proper ksatriyas and vaiśyas existed[^71]. Even as to Śūdra[^72] some writers like Kamalākarabhaṭṭa went so far that a śūdra could not read and study open purāṇas but should only listen to their recital by brāhmanas.

Meaning of homa, yāga, dāna

33

 The result was that most people performed only _pūjā_ and not homa in Agni. According to most writers the homa was to be performed in honour of that deity for whose favour the vrata was performed. According to Vardha māna and a few others the homa in a vrata may be in honour of the deity of the vrata or may be a vyāhṛtihoma[^73]. It is stated by the Agnipurāṇa[^74] that there is _japa_, homa and also gifts at the end of all vratas in general and the Viṣṇudharmottara observes that those who perform upavāsavrata should inaudibly mutter the mantras of that deity, should meditate on that deity, should listen to stories about that deity, should worship the image of that deity, should take the names of that deity and listen to others singing the names. Pūrvamimāṁsā writers made a distinction between _homa_, _yāga_ and _dāna_. Śabara[^75] on Jai. IV. 2. 28 puts the distinction in a nutshell by saying that' giving up what belongs to one is common to all the three, but _yāga_ means simply giving up something intending it for a deity and accompanying it with a mantra; in _homa_ there is in addition the throwing of a thing in fire; dāna consists in abandoning a thing that belongs to one and creating the owner ship of another in that thing.' In another place (on Jai. IX. 1. 6), Śabara refers to the argument that yāga is nothing but the worship of a deity (api ca yāgo nāma devatāpūjā).

Manu II. 176 and Yāj. I. 99, 100, 102 show that _Devapūjā_ is different from[^76] _homa_ and was performed after the latter according to Marīci and Hārīta quoted in the Smṛticandrikā, Smr̥ti-muktā-phala and other digests.

[^73]: Vide H. of Dh vol. II, pp. 207-211 for the description of a model homa and the order of the several parts in a homa. The four oblations with the Vyāhṛtis would be भूः स्वाहा, भुवः स्वाहा, स्वः स्वाहा, भूर्भुवः स्व: स्वाहा with ओम् prefixed to each.

 Certain matters connected with devapūjā such as the questions whether images of gods were worshipped in the times of the Ṛgveda and the Samhitās, whether the worship of images arose spontaneously among the Vedic Aryans or whether it was derived from some other race or sectarians or from sūdras and Dravidian tribes, have already been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 705-712. Similarly, descriptions of devapūjā and the several items and stages in the procedure of devapūjā have been set out in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 726-735. A few matters either not set out there at all or briefly set out may be spoken of here. It should be noted that ordinarily there are 16 upacāras[^77] (items of showing honour) in the procedure of devapūjā, but they may be increased to 36 or 38 or reduced to 14, 12, 10 or 5 and there is no complete unanimity on the question of the names of the 16 upacāras and their order. The Brahmavaivartapurāṇa sets out what the sixteen, twelve and five upacāras are. The Vratarka quotes verses enumerating 38, 16, 10 or 5 upacāras. If a person is unable to offer even five upacāras then he should offer two, viz. sandalwood paste and flowers and if he cannot do even that, then he may offer only devotion. So says the Kālikāpurāṇa quoted in Varśakriyā-kaumudī p. 157. From Śabara's _bhāṣya_ on Jai. V. 1. 4 it follows that long before his day (not later than 4th century A. D.) the order (_krama_) of the upacāras had been settled[^78].

The व. क्रि. को. p 156 notes that there is slight difference in the order in which some apacāras are offered 'अत्र अर्ध्यानन्तरं पाद्यमाचमनीयं चोक्तम् । शारदातिलकादिषु पाद्याचमनीयानन्तरमध्यर्मुक्तम् । कालिकापुराणे पाद्यार्थ्याचमनीयक्रम उक्तः ': Vide ब्रह्मवैवर्त (ब्रह्मखण्ड) chap. 26.90-92 for उपचारs.

Upacaras in pūjā        
35
Medieval works like the Vratārka (folio 23 b ff) and V. K. K. pp. 200-201 (quoting Nṛsimhapurāṇa 62. 8-14) prescribe for all vratas in general the recital of each of the sixteen versos of the Puruśasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90) with each of the sixteen upacāras in order (viz. āvāhana, āsana, pādya, arghya, ācamaniyaka, snāna, vastra, yajñopavīta, anulepana (or gandha), puspa, dhūpa, dipa, naivedya, tāmbūla, daksiṇā, pradaksiṇā); while some works associate with each of these one or more Paurāṇika mantras also. It should not be supposed that these upacāras (particularly puspa, gandha, dhūpa, dīpa and naivedya) were absent in the Vedic age and came into prominence at a very late stage by being borrowed from non-Aryan people. The Aśvins are described as wearing wreaths of blue lotuses (puskarasrajā) in Ṛg X. 184. % and Atharva III. 22. 4; the Maruts also are spoken of as wearing wreaths (Ṛg. V. 53. 4). In numerous passages the Ṛgveda refers to the casting of offerings (_havya_) mixed with clarified butter in Agni (e. g. Ṛg. III. 59. 1 and 5)[^79] The gods are even asked to _eat_ apūpa, purodāśa, dhānā, milk, curds, honey &c. in Ṛg. III. 53. 8, III. 52. 1-7, IV. 32. 16, VIII. 91. 2, in Atharva XVIII. 4. 16–26. The underlying conception in these passages is the same as that involved in offering _naivedya_ to an image. In the Satapatha Br.[^80] So the word _upacāra_ appears to have been used in the sense of 'honour' or 'mode of showing honour.' In the Tai. Ā. X. 40[^81] occurs a mantra called 'Medhā-janana' which was recited in the ear of a child in the _jātakarma_ 'may god Savitṛ, goddess Sarasvatī and the gods Aśvins wearing wreaths of blue lotuses produce in you intelligence'. There is evidence that long before the time of the gṛhyasūtras several of the sixteen upacāras were well-known.

This last is a precursor of the idea of नैवेद्य, which word should be derived from निवेद्य ( what is presented or offered) on the analogy of words like चातुर्वर्ण्य and त्रैलोक्य (from त्रि+लोक ). The कुलार्णवतन्त्र (_ullāsa_ 17. 80 ) derives it in this way' निवेदनाद्भवेत्तृप्तिर्नैवेद्यं तदुदाहतम्'.

The Nighaṇṭu (III. 14) enumerates 44 verbs that have the sense of worship' among which 'pūjayati' is included. The Nirukta in explaining the word 'supāṇiḥ' occurring in Ṛg. III. 33. 6 states that the word 'pāṇi' is [^82] derived from 'paṇ' to offer pūjā and supports this derivation by saying that people worship gods by joining together their hands. It is clear that the Nighanṭu treated 'pūjayati' as a verb occurring in the Vedas and that folding the hands (i. e. namaskāra) was a item of worship long before the Nirukta. While explaining the word 'saparyan' occurring in Ṛg. III. 31. 1 the Nirukta offers 'pūjayan' as a synonym. From Pāṇini[^83] V. 3. 99 and the Mahābhāṣya thereon it is clearly seen that in the days of the former images of gods were made for sale and also for worship. Patañjali expressly says that the rule applies to images which were worshipped and which gave livelihood to the _Pujaris_ of those images and not to images made for sale. Vide also Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇini I. 1. 25. The Āśv. Gr.[^84] provides that when _madhuparka_ is to be offered to a ṛtvik, an ācārya, a bridegroom, a king or a snātaka or a relative (like father-in-law, paternal or maternal uncle), a seat, water for washing the feet, argḥya water, water for ācamana, honey mixture, a cow are to be announced to the guest three times in each case. In another place, the same sūtra[^85] speaks of the presentation of sandal-wood paste, flowers, incense, lamp and garment to the brāhmaṇas invited at a śrāddha. In these two passages alone nine of the 16 upacāras are mentioned. The word pūjā took on a secondary meaning, viz. (honour without use of gandha, puśpa &c.) even in the times of Dharmasūtrās (vide Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 9, 'nityā ca pūjā yathopadeśam'). Yāj. (I. 229 ff) mentions in srāddha _āvāhana_, _arghya_, _gandha_, _mālya_, _dhūpa_, _dīpa_ &c.

[^82]: पाणिः पणायतेः पूजाकर्मणः। प्रगृह्य पाणी देवान् पूजयन्ति। निरुक्तः II. 26; it may be noted that the Nighaṇṭu III. 5 enumerates ten verbs meaning 'paricaraṇa' (waiting upon ) one of which is सपर्यति, while 44 verbs of which पूजयति is one are separately enumerated as meaning 'अर्चति'.

On पा. I. 1. 25 the महाभाष्य says 'काश्यपग्रहणं पूजार्थम्.'

Origin of pūjā

When the worship of images became common, the upacāras that had been offered for showing honour and worship to worthy men were by a natural analogy employed in it. In my view the theory that pūjā and the upacāras were borrowed from the Dravidians or some non-Aryan people cannot be held to be proved, is quite speculative and that 'pūjā' of images of gods was an indigenous development. Medieval writers were careful to point out that there was no essential difference between yāga (vedic or other sacrifice) and pūjā, as in both there was the giving of some substance intending it for a deity. Prof. J. Charpentier contributed a paper on the meaning and etymology of pūjā' to the Indian Antiquary vol. 56. pp. 93-99 and pp. 130 ff. I demur to his conclusions. He points out that 'pu' in Tamil means 'flower', that the word pūjā is derived from Dravidian 'pūcu', 'pūsu' to paint or daub' (p. 133) and asks the question why red colour is used in the worship of Gods; he himself answers it by suggesting that it was a substitute for blood. There is no reason whatever for assuming that pūjā was derived from 'pu' and not from 'puspa' (flower) which was known to the Ṛgveda (II. 13. 7 'puśpinīḥ'and X. 97.3 'puspavatīḥ'). There is no sound reason to assume that 'pūcu' (to paint) existed thousands of years ago in Dravidian languages and was not a more recent acquisition, when the word pūjā can be traced a thousand years before any existing literary work in any Dravidian language.[^86]

Some works on vratas treat at great length the several upacāras, particularly flowers that should be offered to the various images worshipped, the consequences of offering those flowers, the various kinds of fragrant substances (_gandha_) to be offered or the incense to be burnt, the nature of the foods &c. Vide for example, Hemādri (on vrata) vol. I, pp. 49-51, Kr̥tyaratnakara pp. 70-71, 77-79, Varsakriyakaumudi pp. 156-181. For reasons of space it is not possible to treat of these matters here. Besides, H. of Dh. vol. II. (pp. 731-734) deals at some length with the unguents, the flowers, the lamps, the naivedya to be offered in the ordinary _devapūjā_. A few matters not mentioned there are set out here for the sake of completeness of treatment. The Sm. C. 1. p. 201 quotes the Padmapurāṇa[^87] to the effect that sandal wood is holy among unguents (gandha), _agaru_ (Agalochum) is better than sandalwood, dark _agaru_ is still better and saffron is preferable to dark _agaru_.

[ Sec. I, Ch. II

 Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 43–44) quotes passages from several purāṇas defining[^88] _catuḥsama_ as tvak i. e. cinnamon, patraka ( cassia leaf), lavanga i.e. cloves, and saffron (or two parts of musk, four of sandalwood, three of saffron and one of camphor) and sarvagandha as saffron, sandalwood, _uśira_ (fragrant roots of a plant), _mustā_, lāmajja (root of fragrant grass), camphor and the three perfumed things viz. _tvak_, cardamom and _patraka_ and Yakśakardama as camphor, _agaru_, musk, sandalwood and _kakkola_. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 202.1) first states that Hari is pleased by the offerings of flowers, perfumes, incense, lamps and _naivedya_ and then specifies the flowers that are fit for offering to the deities and that are unfit (verses 2-15). The Kalpataru on vrata (pp. 180–181) quotes the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva 197.1-11) for stating the consequences of using various flowers in worship, viz. worship with mālati flowers leads the worshipper in the presence of god, worship with _karavira_ flowers confers health and incomparable prosperity, by the flowers of Mallikā the worshipper becomes endowed with all pleasures, with pundarika (lotuses) he secures bliss and lasting wealth, with flowers of the fragrant _kubjaka_ he secures highest prosperity, with lotuses (white and blue) he secures spotless fame, with various _mukurakas_ (Jasminium zambac) he is freed from disease, worship with Mandāra flowers destroys all kinds of leprosy, and with bilva flowers he obtains wealth, with _arka_ flowers the Lord Sun confers blessings, with a garland of _bakula_ flowers the worshipper has a beautiful daughter, the Sun worshipped with Kimśuka flowers does away with trouble, with Agastya flowers the deity gives success and worship with lotuses gives a beautiful wife, with vanamālā the worshipper becomes free from tiredness; the worshipper of the Sun with Asoka flowers makes no mistakes, and the Sun worshipped with _japā_ (china rose) flowers frees the worshipper from trouble. About dhūpa (incense burnt in worship) a good deal is said in the digests.

Dhūpa in pūjā

The Kalpataru (on vrata pp. 182-183)[^89] observes as follows: The Sun comes near (i. e. favours) a worshipper who burns sandalwood and confers desired objects when one burns _agaru_ as dhūpa; one who desires health should burn _guggulu_; the Sun is always pleased by the use of pindāṇga (i.e. _silhaka_) and confers health, wealth and the highest bliss; a man secures blessedness by using _kundaka_ (the exudation of _sallaki_) as dhūpa and trade becomes fruitful by using śrivāsaka (_sarala_) as dhūpa and one gets wealth by burning rasa (myrrh) and sarjarasa (resin of the śāl tree). Bāṇa in the Kādambari (pārvārdha, para 56) refers to the practice of burning _guggulu_ in the temple of Caṇdikā. Kalpataru (on vrata pp. 6-7), Hemādri (on vrata) vol. I. pp. 50-51, Kr̥tya ratnākara p. 78 quote several verses from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa defining dhūpas called 'amrta', 'ananta', yaksānga, mahānga. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa[^90] remarks: the _jāti_ is the best among flowers, kundaka is the best dhūpa, saffron is best among fragrant substances, sandalwood among unguents; ghee is best for lighting lamps and _modaka_ sweets among naivedya foods. It may be noted that the burning of guggulu and other substances had a practical end in view, viz. the destruction of fleas and bees[^91].

It is no doubt true that in most vratas brāhmaṇas are to be fed, but one should not run away with the idea that the blind, the poor and the helpless were altogether forgotten. In the case of many vratas it is expressly provided that food should be given to the blind, the poor and the helpless.



[^89]: अगुरुं चन्दनं मुस्ता सिह्लकं वृषणं तथा। समभागं तु कर्तव्यं धूपोयऽममृताह्नयः॥ श्रीखण्डं ग्रन्थिसहितमगुरुं सिह्लकं तथा। मुस्तां तथेन्दुं भूतेश शर्करां च दहेत् त्र्यहम् । इत्येषोऽनन्तधूपश्व कथितो देवसत्तम॥ भविष्य q. by कल्पतरु (on व्रत p. 6), हे. (on व्रत vol. I. p. 50).

In describing the Aviyoga vrata, both the Kalpataru (on vrata p. 75) and Hemādri quote a long passage from the Kālikāpurāṇa in which it is provided that on the day of the vrata tasteful and well-flavoured food and drink without stint should be distributed to the helpless, the blind and the deaf[^92]. Vide also Kalpataru (on vrata) p. 390 (on Hari vrata), p. 391 (on Pātravrata), p. 397 (Mahāvrata), Hemādri and Kr̥tyaratnakara p. 481 on Śivaratrivrata, Kr̥tyaratnakara p. 461 (on Mitrasaptami). The Bhaviṣya (Uttara, 22. 33-34)[^93] recommends that one observing a vrata should provide food for the blind, the distressed and the helpless according to his means, As in the case[^94] of śrāddhas, particularly at Gayā, the Purāṇas often enjoin lavish expenditure on vratas and condemn stinginess or spending less on them than one is able to spend. Vide Matsya 100.36. The Bhavisyottara[^95] on Ubhayadvādaśīvrata states 'the performer of Ubhayadvādaśīvrata being solely devoted to Kṛśṇa should not be tricky (spend less) in spending wealth'. In respect of Aviyogavrata the Kālikā-purāṇa provides 'the performer free from trickiness about wealth should give an equivalent to the brāhmaṇas or the couple if he is unable (to give pearls and precious stones)'. Vide also Padma VI. 39. 21, Matsya 62. 34, 93. 109,95. 32,98. 12.

Virtues required in all vratas



There are certain virtues that the person undergoing a vrata has to cultivate. The Agnipurāṇa speaks[^96] of ten virtues that must be cultivated as common to all vratas viz. 'forbearance, truthfulness, compassion, charity, purity (of body and mind), curbing the organs of sense, worship of deities (or images), offerings into fire, contentment, not depriving another of his property. This ten-fold dharma is declared as common to all vratas.' Devala prescribes : _brahmacarya_ (celibacy), purity, truthfulness and giving up of flesh-eating—these four are the highest (virtues) in vratas. Brahmacarya is lost by looking at (stranger) women, touching them and engaging in talk with them, but not by sexual intercourse with one's wife during the allowed days after her monthly illness'. The Nāradiyapurāṇa remarks[^97] 'brahmacarya is prescribed for being observed in all vratas and it is declared that generally sacrificial food is eaten'. _Haviśyānna_ is variously defined. Manu[^98] says 'the food proper for hermits (such as _nivāra_), milk, juice of soma plant, flesh that has not become putrid, and akśāralavaṇa (natural salt) these are declared to be (fit) sacrificial food by nature'. Though flesh was offered in śrāddhas in the times of the several early smṛtis such as that of Yāj. flesh must be excluded from the list of proper foods in the case of vratas owing to the express provisions contained in Devala-smr̥ti (cited above) and others. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 149 n. 343 for _haviśya_ food. The Kr̥tyaratnakara[^99] quotes a long passage from the Samayapradipa on what food should be partaken in vratas viz. 'first come yavas (barley), on failure of them _vrīhi_ ( rice), on failure of this, other food except māsa (black beans), _kodrava_, gram, _masūra_ (a kind of pulse), _cina_ and kapittha'. There are somewhat conflicting passages in the several Purāṇas about the foods that are acceptable or should be rejected.

 For example, the Agnipurāṇana[^100] ( in 175. 12) first states that kśāra, lavaṇa, honey and flesh should be eschewed in vrata, then (in 175. 13-14) includes among ksāra all cereals in pods except sesame and _mudga_, and among corn wheat and kodravas and several others are included in kṣāra group (i.e. they are to be eschewed in Vrata) and proceeds (175. 14-15) 'rice, saśṭika (corn that ripens in sixty days from the date of sowing), mudga, kalaya (peas), sesame and yava, śyāmāka (millet), nivāra (wild rice grains), wheat and others are beneficial (i.e. allowed) in vratas, while one should give up (in vrata) kūṣmānda (pumpkin gourd), alābu (bottle gourd), vārtāka (egg plant), pālanki (a kind of vegetable) and pūtikā. The Padmapurāṇa[^101] provides that one who is observing naktavrata must observe six things, viz. haviśya meals, bath, truthfulness, small quantity of food, worship of Agni and sleeping on the ground (not on a cot). The Bhujabala[^102] says: all should avoid while observing vrata the use of bell metal (vessel), flesh, _masūra_, gram, kodrava, vegetables, honey and the food cooked in another's house. Harita lays[^103] down what should be avoided on the day of vrata: one should avoid on the fast day talk with one guilty of heavy sins, heterodox sectarians and atheists and speaking what is untrue and obscene. The Sāntiparva says 'one engaged in vrata should not converse with women, sūdras and _patita_'. The Bșhadyogi-Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti[^104] observes: one should not talk at the time of japa or vrata or homa and the like to women, sūdras, _patita_, sectarians, a woman in her monthly illness; if there be a failure in the restraint of speech (with these) in japa and the rest, he should recite a mantra addressed to Viṣṇu or remember Viṣṇu who is imperishable.

Praise of vratas



The Purāṇas extol, as in the case of pilgrimages, the performance of vratas to the skies. Certain vratas like those to be undergone by a Vedic student had ceased to be in vogue and vratas associated with Vedic sacrifices also had become rare in the centuries before the Christian era. In the gṛhya and dharma sūtras and in ancient smr̥tis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya what were called vratas in the Purāṇas did not occupy any very prominent position. During the early centuries of the Christian era Buddhism and Jainism were influential rivals of the ancient sacrificial system. In order to wean away common people from those two schisms it is very probable that learned followers of the Vedic system hit upon the glorification of vratas and promised heaven and otherworldly and spiritual rewards to those who performed vratas that were comparatively easy and within reach of all instead of sacrifices and also adopted some of the practices of common folks as vratas, e.g. kukkuṭi-markati-vrata in Bhavisyottara 46. 1-43, Sitalāvrata (Vratārka folio 111 b-113 b, N. S. p. 123). The Brahmapurāṇa[^105] says 'the reward that is secured by the worship of the Sun for a single day cannot be secured by hundreds of Vedic sacrifices or by brāhmaṇas to whom the fees stated in the texts are paid'. The Padmapurāṇa[^106] extols Jayantivrata by saying that in the body of the man who performs it all holy places and deities reside. The Garuḍapurāṇa[^107] quoted by Hemādri states that the Kāñcanapurivrata described by it is more purifying than even the Ganges, Kuruksetra, Kāśi and Puskara. The Bhaviṣya-purāṇa (Uttara 7.1) provides that a man crosses easily the deep ocean of hells by means of the boat of vratas, _upavāsas_ and niyamas.

 In the Mahābhārata[^108] ( and the Padmapurāṇa VI. 53. 4-6) it is stated that the Vedic rites and rites prescribed by Manu cannot be performed in Kaliyuga and that therefore it declares to Yudhisthira something that would be an easy remedy, requiring little wealth and causing little trouble but securing great rewards and that would be the essence of Purāṇas, viz. one should not eat on the Ekādaśī of both fortnights; he who does not eat food on Ekadasi does not go to hell. About the Ubhayadvādaśīvrata described in the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa it is said that Prabhāsa,[^109] Gayā, Puśkara, Vārānasi, Prayāga or holy places to the east or west thereof, or to the north are not superior or equal to the Kārtika vrata. The Anuśāsana-parva[^110] proclaims that there is no higher _tapas_ than upavāsa (fasting) or even equal to it and that poor men can secure the rewards of sacrifices by resorting to the upavāsa described. Hemādri quotes two verses on Arkavrata from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa stating that if a man observes for a year _nakta_ on the 6th and 7th tithis in each fortnight he obtains the merit secured by those who perform the Vedic sacrifices called _sattras_ or who observe the vow of speaking the truth.

In the Varāhapurana the question[^111] asked is 'how can a poor man reach God' and the reply is that he can do so by _vratas_ and fasts.
[^108]: श्रुतास्ते मानवा धर्मा वैदिकाश्च श्रुता मया। कलौ युगे न शक्यन्ते ते वै कर्तु मराधिप॥ सुखोपायमल्पधनमल्पक्लेशं महाफलम्। पुराणानां च सर्वेषां सारभूतं वदामि ते॥ एकादश्यां न भुञ्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि । ... एकादश्यां न भुञ्जन्ति न ते यान्ति यमालयम् । पद्म IV. 53. 4 ff; these are quoted from महाभारत by हेमाद्रि (व्रत I. p. 1089).

Eulogy of vratas

 The Lingapurāṇa (pūrvārdha 83. 4) provides that one who for a year observes _nakta_ (eating only once in the evening) and worship of Śiva on the 14th and 8th tithis in each pakṣa (fortnight) secures the reward of all sacrifices and reaches the highest goal. The Bhaviṣya asserts that brāhmanas who have no sacred fires (śrauta or smārta) benefit in this way that gods become pleased with them by (the observance of) vratas, fasts, restrictive rules of conduct and various kinds of gifts, particularly by a fast on special tithis.

The keynote struck by the Matsya, Brahma and other Purāṇas is how to secure great rewards with little effort. The Brahma-purāṇa remarks that by merely taking in Kaliyuga the name of Keśava a man obtains the same rewards that one got in kṛta-yuga by deep meditation, in Tretā by performing sacrifices and in Dvāpara by worship (of images). The Matsya says: The great sages do not commend sacrifices which involve killing (of animals); those whose wealth is _tapas_ became firmly placed in heaven by making gifts, according to their means, of particles of grains (collected from fields &c.), roots, fruits, vegetables and water vessels and that _tapas_ is superior for (several) reasons to sacrifices. The Padmapurāṇa reaches the peak of exaggeration when it says 'no one except Hari will be able to recount the merit of him who offers a lamp on the day of Hari in Kārtika with devotion' or 'Viṣṇuvrata is the highest, a hundred solemn Vedic sacrifices are not equal to it'. The Skandapurāṇa[^112] (quoted by Hemādri on vrata vol. I. pp. 318-321 ) contains a long eulogy of vrata, one verse of which may be cited here 'Gods attained their position through restrictive observances (vratas); they shine forth as stars by virtue of the vratas ( they performed)'.

There were certain differences between Vedic sacrifices and vratas. The promised reward of most sacrifices was heaven, while Purāṇas promised that most vratas would confer tangible benefits in this very life. Further, vratas could be performed by: all, including sūdras, maidens, married women, widows, even prostitutes.

There were vratas for the _brahmcārin_ (called Veda-vratas ) and for the snātaka. These have been already dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 370-374 and pp. 412-415 respectively.

That vratas (in the medieval sense ) existed even in the first centuries before and after the Christian era follows from the Āp. Dh. S. and from the dramas of Kālidāsa, from the Mṛcchakaṭika and the Ratnāyali. The Āp. Dh. S. II. 8. 18 prescribes a vrata for one year which is equal in its merit to brahmacārivrata for 48 years and Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 18-19 to Āp. Dh. S. II. 8. 20 prescribe two modes of a vrata to be begun on Tisya (Puśya) nakṣatra to be observed by a person desirous of prosperity. Vide S. B. E. vol. II, pp. 145– 148. Hemādri (vrata II. .p. 628 quotes Āp. Dh. S. II. 8. 20.3-9), explains the sutras and calls this Āpastambokta Pusyavrata.

In the Śākuntala (Act. II) the dowager queen (mother of Duṣyanta) sends a message that on the 4th day from the date of the message her fast (vrata) would end [^113]. The Vikramoryasiya (III) appears to refer to a vrata called in later times Rohiṇīcandrasayana-vrata (vide Hemādri vol. II. pp. 599-600 ). It may be noted that in the above works royal ladies are described as observing vratas. In the Raghuvaṃśa Kalidāsa alludes to an Āsidhāra-vrata (XIII. 67). The Mrcchakatika (Act I) speaks of an upavāsa (a vrata) called Abhirupapati which appears to bave been somewhat like the Bhartrprāptivrata described by Hemādri (vol. I. pp. 1199-1200). The Ratnāvali ( Act I at ond) describes Madanamahotsava which reminds us of the same described in Hemādri (vol. II, pp. 21-24). It appears, however, that the number of vratas in the first centuries of the Christian era was not very large. Gradually, however, the number of vratas increased by leaps and bounds and their total number, as seen from the list furnished at the end of this section, would be in the region of one thousand. One of the earliest digests on _tithis_ and astrological matters in relation to Dharmaśāstra is the Rājamārtaṇḍa of king Bhoja (1st half of 11th century A. D.). It mentions only a few vratas (about 24). The next important extant work is the Kștyakalpataru of Laksmidhara (1st half of 12th century A. D.) who mentions in the vratakāṇda about 175. A comparatively later work viz. the Vratakālaviveka of Śūlapāṇi (1375–1430 A. D.), which discusses the rules about the proper times for observing vratas, mentions only 11 vratas. Hemādri's is the largest published work on vratas, containing as it does about 2200 printed pages in the B. I. edition. It deals with about 700 vratas.

Works on vratas

 This shows that towards the end of the thirteenth century, when foreign invaders had seized the larger part of India and were ruthlessly razing temples to the ground and converting by force and fraud thousands to their faith, the men of the day, both learned and ignorant, were expending vast intellectual labour and huge sums of money on vratas, pilgrimages and śrāddhas, blissfully ignorant of and blind to the political and religious dangers that engulfed them all.

The vratakośa edited by M. M. Gopinath Kaviraja (in the Sarasvatibhavana series in 1929 ) lists 1622 vratas, but that list is unduly swollen and inflated for various reasons[^114]. For example, the Asṭakā-śrāddhas and Anvaśṭaka-śrāddhas are included and have nine numbers assigned to them. There are twelve numbers assigned to Anantavrata because it is performed for twelve months from Mārgaśīrṣa, but Hemādri (on vrata vol. II. pp. 667-671 ) treats it as one vrata. Upavāsavrata is given four numbers, the only reference given being Hemādri (vrata) II. p. 509 (only 11/2 lines from Matsya). Hemādri (vrata II. pp. 748-52, 757 and so on) describes _Ekabhakta_ twelve times in each month from Caitra to Phālguna and then on II. p. 863 refers to him who performs Ekabhaktavrata for one year. The Vratakośa gives 13 separate numbers (2 for Ekabhakta and 11 for Ekabhukta, for this latter form there being no authority of Hemādri who calls all the 13 Ekabhaktavrata). Grahaśānti is given five numbers. It is unnecessary to multiply examples. If properly sifted the number would be much smaller than 1000.


[^114]: It has to be remembered that several different vratas are mentioned under the same name, also that different names are given to the same vrata and that some śantis, utsavas and snānas also are described in works on vratas.






When a person undertakes a vrata he must see to it that he finishes it; for dire consequences are laid down for him who gives it up through heedlessness. Chāgaleya declares[^115] 'when a person, having first undertaken a vrata, does not carry it out, being led away by some desire, he while alive becomes (i. e. is to be treated as) a cāṇḍāla and after death becomes a dog'. In such a case where through greed, infatuation or inadvertence a man is guilty of breaking his vrata, he has to undergo three days' fast and also shave his head and then begin the vrata (the remainder acc. to Nirṇayasindhu, the whole of it acc. to Sūlapāṇi). The Varāhapurāṇa states that man who undertakes a vrata on ekādaśī day but does not, owing to foolishness, finish it, reaches a very evil state'.

Death in the midst of a vrata did not deprive the performer of the merit for which he began it. Angiras[^116] provides 'if a person that has begun some religious act for some benefit dies before the rite is finished, he secures the merit that is the reward ( of that act) after his death; Manu so declared'.

No one should undertake a vrata in the midst of _aśauca_ (impurity on birth and death ). But it is provided by the Viṣṇudharmasutra[^117] (22.49) that āśauca does not affect the king in doing his royal duties, nor those undergoing a vrata in the carrying out of the vrata. Similarly, Laghu-Viṣṇu observes: in the case of vratas, sacrifices, marriages, in śrāddha, homa, worship (of an image ), in _japa_, impurity does not affect after they are begun, but it affects before they are begun ( i.e. is an obstacle to beginning these after impurity). Yaj. III. 28-29 are similar verses.

Matters not affecting vratas

It is laid down in the śāstras[^118] that danger ( to the observer of vrata ) from all beings, disease, forgetfulness, the command of one's _guru_ do not break a vrata provided these occur only once ( during the period of the particular vrata ). It is provided by the Matsya-purāṇa, Agni and Satyavrata[^119] that in the case of women that have commenced a vrata of long duration there is no stoppage of the vrata if they have monthly illness in the midst of the vrata or they become pregnant or are delivered of a child and that they should get the rites performed by another as long as they are impure, but physical acts (such as fasting ) may be done by them. There are certain other matters that do not affect the observance of a vrata, viz. (drinking )[^120] water, (partaking of ) roots, fruits and milk and sacrificial offering, the desire ( or command) of a brahmaṇa, the order of one's guru and medicine. Hemādri remarks that the drinking of milk and the rest that follow do not affect vrata if the performer is a woman, a child or one who is in extreme pain. A person observing vrata[^121] should eschew all this, viz. anointing the body or the head with oil, chewing tāmbūla, applying sandalwood paste and whatever else would increase physical strength or passion.

What actions do not detract from the observance of upavāsa will be discussed later.

H. D. 7





A few words about homa may be said here. Women could not offer homa with mantras (Manu IX. 18). Homa could be performed for them through a priest. When no particular substance is specified the _āhuti_ (offering ) into fire is to be of clarified butter ( Karmapradipa of Gobhila I. 113)[^122] The number of āhutis may be 108, 28 or 8 or as many as are expressly specified. The Samayapradīpa ( folio 4 b) has a long discussion about the fire in which _homa_ is to be made. One who is an āhitāgni (who has established the sacred Vedic fires) should employ the fire established by him when he was married, as laid down by Yāj. (1.97). According to some, the rule of Yāj. applies only to gṛhya rites that are laid down in the Gṛhyasūtras and that oven an āhitāgni should employ ordinary fire for his vratas. One who has no _smārta_ fire should also perform vrata homas in ordinary fire by himself or through a priest.
