CHAPTER V NAMES OF ALL PRĀYAŚCITTAS


CHAPTER V NAMES OF ALL PRĀYAŚCITTAS

Now all the prāyascittas mentioned in the smrtis and digests will be arranged in alphabetical order (Sanskrit, transliterated into English), excepting mere hymns, fasts, &c. and brief explanations and references will be added to each.

AGHAMARSANA-( The hymn Rg. X.190.1-3).

This is prescribed as a penance for all sins by even the most ancient Dharmaśāstra works such as Gaut. 24.11, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 2.19-20, Vas. 26.8, Manu XI.259–260, Yāj. III.301, Vispu Dh, S. 55.7, Sankha 18.1-2 and others. They prescribe that if a man recites (for three days, according to Haradatta ) the Agharmarsana hymn thrice in the day while immersed in water for a bath, he is freed from all sins and that this penance is equal in sanctification to the bath at the end of the Asvamedha sacrifice. The Pr. Sāra p. 199 speaks of the Aghamarṣana vrata. He has to fast for three days and stand up by day and sit up by night and donate a milch cow at the end, Sankha 18.1-2 and Visṇu Dh. S.46.1-9 prescribe the details.

ATIKRCCHRA-Vide under Krcchra. Manu XI. 213 prescribes that this penance is constituted by eating only one morsel of food for three days in the morning only, for three days in the evening only, for three days eating one morsel got without asking for it and observing a complete fast for the next three days. Yāj. III.319, on the other hand, prescribes the eating of just as much food as would fill the hand (and not merely one morsel). The Mit., Pr. Sāra (p. 176 ) and others state that the rule of Manu applies to those who are able to undergo it, while that of Yāj. is meant for those who are unable (asakta). The Sāmavidhāna Br. 1.2.6-7, Gaut. 26.18-19, Visnu Dh, S.54.30, Laugāksigțhya V.12-13, Parāśara XI.54-55, Vas. 24.1-2, Baud. Dh, S. IV.5.8 also speak of this. Manu XI, 208 ( = Visnu 54,30 ) prescribes this penance for striking a brahmana with a weapon or a cudgel. Gaut. 26,22 states that this penanca purifies a man of all sins except the mahāpūtakas,

ATISANTAPANA-See under Mahā-sāntapana. This is variously defined. According to the Agnipurāṇa 171.10 and Usnu ji Dh. S. 46.21 it lasts for 18 days (3 times of the Maha-sāntapaita in which for six days one has to subsist on cow's urine and five

131 other things). The Mit on Yāj. III. 315 quotes a verse of Yama according to which this penance lasts for 12 days. 296 The Pr. M. (p. 23 ) speaks of it as lasting for 15 days.

ARDHAKROCHRA-See under Krcchra. According to the Āpastamba-smrti 9.43-44. this is constituted by taking food only once in the day for one day, only once in the evening for one day, taking food for two days without asking for it and completely fasting for two days 297 (in all six days). The Mit. quotes another variety of it, viz. subsisting for three days on food obtained without asking for it and thereafter observing a complete fast for three days.

AŚVAMEDHAVABHRTHASNANA- the ceremonial bath in the sea or a holy river at the end of an Aśvarnedha sacrifice. Visnu Dh. S. 36 (last verse) prescribes for those guilty of mahāpātakas and anupātakas the Asyamedha sacrifice. It is only an emperor or a crowned king who is entitled to perform an Aśvamedha, at the end of which comes a ceremonial bath. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II, pp. 1228-1236 for a description of the Aśvamedha. According to Pr. V. p. 65 only a ksatriya could perform Aśvamedha and so this bath was a penance for him alone. But according to Kullūka (on Manu XI. 92) and Pr. T. (both quoting a verse from Bhavisya-purāṇa) even a brāhmana could participate in the bath at the end of the Aśvamedha and become free from the sin of brālimana murder if committed unintentionally. 298

AGNEYA KRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāṇa and Vispudharmottara if a man subsists for twelve days on sesame alone that is āgneya Krcchra. 299 Vide also Pr. Pr. (folio 48 b.)

RSICANDRAYANA-According to Brhad-Visnu quoted by Pr. Prakarana p. 132 this penance requires that one should take only three mouthfuls of sacrificial food every day for a month. 300

EKABHAKTA-According to Pr. Pr. (folio 48a) if one takes for a month only one meal a day it is ekabhaktaka. 301

KRCCHRA-This is the general word for several penances. The Sāma. Br. (I.2 1) starts 302 by saying 'we shall now expound three krcchras' and adds that one should eat sacrificial food for three days only by day and eat nothing at night, then for three days more one should eat at night only, then for three more days one should not beg or ask for food from others and should then observe a complete fast for three days. If he is in a hurry to purify himself he should pass the day standing and the night in a sitting posture. Gaut. (26.2-16) describes the procedure of the first Krochra (called Prājāpatya by later writers ), then Atikrcchra (26.18-19), and then Krcchrātikrcchra (26,20). Baud. Dh. S. (II.1.91 ) speaks of Parāka as Kịcchra. Āp. Dh. S. (1.9.27.7) describes the Krcchra penance of twelve days. The Kịcchra penance described by Gaut. 26.2-16 is one for twelve days and is called Prājāpatya by Manu (XI 211), Sankha (18.3), Yaj. III 319 and others. Laugāksi Gr. (5.3-11) describes Krcchra. According to the Par. 303 M. (II. part 1 p. 30) and Pr. Pr, (folio 64a ) the word Krochra without any qualifying epithet (upapada) means Prājāpatya. The Pr. T. (p. 481 ) states that the Krcchra described by Gaut. (26.1-5) is given the name of Prājāpatya by Manu (XI. 211). Besides the rules about the intake of food, Gaut. prescribes certain other observ ances viz. speaking the truth, not holding conversation with

men and women that are anāryas (not of the three higher castes ), always singing the sāmans called 'Raurava' and

Yaudhājapa', bathing thrice in the day in the morning, the noon and the night, then performing mārjana 304 ( sprinkling of of water) with the three verses beginning with 'Apo hi stha' (Rg. X.9,1-3), with the mantras called 'pavitravati' viz. those beginning with 'pavamānaḥ suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. I 4.8.1) and the eight verses beginning with 'Hiranyavarnāh' (in Tai. S. V. 6.1), he should perform tarpıṇa with water with 13 mantras (Gaut 26.12 ); he performs the worship of Aditya (the sun) with the same mantra (i.e. after tar pana with the 13 mantras, he is to perform the worship of the sun with the same thirteen mantras ) and offers oblations of clarified butter with the same 13 mantras and then on the 13th day he cooks boiled rice and offers oblations into ordinary Agni (svāhā' added at the end of each, such as ' agnaye svāha), Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, Viśve devāḥ, Brahman, Prajāpati and Agni Sviṣtakrt and then feeds the brāhmaṇas.

Krechra-samvatsara-Ap. Dh. S. I. 9.27.8 speaks of this as a penance in which Krechras are undergone continuously in a cycle for one year.

Krcchrātikscchra-Gaut. 26.20 and Sāma. Br. I. 2.8, Vas. 24,3 define it as a krochra where only water is drunk on those days on which food is allowed and Gaut. 26.23 and Sāma. Br. I. 2. 9 state that this penance frees a man from all sins, 305 Yāi. III, 320 ( = Devala 86, first half ) and Brahmapurana q. by Pr. Pr. (folio 40 a) prescribe that in this one has to subsist on water alone for 21 days. This difference between the views of Yāj, on the one hand and of Gaut. on the other is reconciled by the digests by saying that the period depends on the capacity of the sinner. According to Pr. Pr. (folio 46b) and Aparārka p. 1238, Yama prescribed a krcchrātikrochra for 24 days.306 Vide Par.

304. For mārjana vide H. of Dh, vol. II PP 317, 812 n and for tarpana the same vol. pp. 668-9, 689-695, Raurava Sāman is sung on the rk 'punānah soma dbāraya' (Rg. IX. 107.4=Sāmaveda Nos. 511 and 675) and Yaudhājapa on 'Duhāna ūdhar' (Rg. IX. 107.5=Sāmaveda No. 676).

M. II part 1 p.179 and Madanapārijāta p.716. According to Manu XI. 208 (= Visṇu Dh. S. 54.30 ) when a person strikes a brāhmana with a weapon and draws blood, he has to undergo this penance. The Pr. Prakarana (p. 15 ) states that for those unable to undergo Krcchra, one milch cow is a substitute, for Atikịcchra two milch cows and for Kệcchrātikrcchra four.

GOMūTRA-KROCHRA–The Pr. Sāra p. 187 quotes a verse about this: one should make a cow eat to satiety grains of wheat mixed with barley and then may collect the yava grains that are to be found in her dung and then drink the gruel of those yavas cooked in cow's urine. 307

GOVRATA- Pr. Prakarapa (p. 132) quoting the Mārkandeya describes this as follows: One should bathe with cow's urine, should subsist on cow-dung, should always stand among cows, should sit down on cow dung, should drink water only when cows have drunk water; one should not eat when they have not eaten, should stand up when they stand, should sit down when they sit down. This should be continued for a month.

CANDRAYAN A-The word is derived in this way. That rite, where there is action by means of increase and decrease (in the intake of food) in imitation of the course of the phases of the moon, is cāndrāyana. 308 The word occurs in Pān. V.1. 172 (pārāyana-turāyaṇa-cāndrāyanam vartayati). From very ancient times Cāndrāyana has been divided into two varieties, called Yavamadhya 309 (lit. being large in the middle like a grain of yava, and therefore tapering or thin at the ends) and Pipilikāmadhya (lit, having a middle like that of an ant, that is, slender in the middle and large at the ends). Baud. Dh.S. III. 8. 33 names these two varieties. According to Jābāli 310 there are five

varieties of Cândrāyana viz. Yavamadhya, Pipilikāmadhya, Yaticāndrāyana, Sarvatomukha and Siśucāndrāyana. These will be described later on. Yājñavalkya says (III, 326) that where no specific penance is prescribed in the smrti texts, cândrāyaṇa effects purification and cândrāyana may be undergone not as a penance but for the purpose of accumu lating merit and that in the latter case (when performed for a year) the performer enjoys the happiness of going to the world of the moon after death. 311 Manu XI. 221 and Gaut. 27.18 state the same view about cāndrāyana for accumulating merit. When the vrata of cāndrāyana is performed for the sake of merit, there is no tonsure (vide Gaut. 27.3 'vapanam vratam caret' and Haradatta thereon). Gaut. 19.20 (= Vas. 22. 20) prescribes that Kịcchra, Atikrochra and Cāndrāyana are the same penance for all sins (collectively for grave sins, for lesser ones separately, according to Haradatta and others ). Compare Manu V. 21 and XI. 215 (=Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5. 16). Manu XI. 27, Yāj. IUI, 323, Vas, 27.21, Baud, Dh, S. IV.5.18 and others define Cândrāyana (of the Yavamadhya type ) as follows: On the first day of the bright half of a month only one morsel of food ( grāsa or pinda) is taken, on the second tithi two and so on; on the full moon (Paurnamāsi) 15 morsels are taken; then on the first of the dark half 14 morsels, one being reduced on each succeeding day. So on the 14th of the dark half only one morsel is eaten and on the Amāvāsyā there is a complete fast. Here in the middle of the month of thirty days the largest number of morsels is taken (and so this is Yavamadhya) just as on the Paurnamāsi day the moon becomes full and begins to wane from the next day. Here Paurnamāsī is in the middle of the period of the observance as Visnu Dh. S. 47.6 says. If one begins the vrata on the first tithi of the dark half, he reduces one morsel on the 1st i. e. takes 14 morsels on that day, 13 on the 2nd tithi of the dark half and so on. On the 14th of the dark half he eats one morsel and on the amāvāsyā he eats nothing. Then on the 1st of the bright half he takes one morsel and goes on increasing the intake till on the Paurnamāsi he takes 15 morsels. The month is taken in this latter case to be Pūrnimānta. Here in the middle of the observance there is no food taken and a large number of morsels is taken at the beginning and at the end. So this is called Pipilikamadhya. This latter is described by Vau3745

and Manu XI, 216. Vispu Dh. S. 47.5-6 say: Yasyāmamāvāsyā madhye bhavati sa pipilikā-madhyah yasya paurnamāsi sa yavamadhyah. If there are 14 or 16 tithis in any particular paksa (half of a month ) then the number of grāsas must be regulated accordingly. There are other descriptions of cândrāyaṇa. Vide Haradatta on Gaut. 27.12-15. The Kalpataru appears to have held ( explaining two verses of Jābāla) that on the first of the dark half of a month 15 morsels were taken, then one morsel less was taken on each succeeding tithi; so that on amāvāsyā one morsel was eaten, then on the first of the bright half two morsels were eaten and one morsel was added every day so that on the 14th of the bright half fifteen morsels were taken and there was a complete fast on Paurnamāsī. But this seems to be opposed to the very idea of increase and decrease of the intake of food on the analogy of the waxing and waning of the Moon and to several smrti texts such as Vas, 23.45 and Parāśara X. 2. Therefore the Pr. Prakāśa (folio 58b ) finds fault with it. 311a. Cândrāyana may be divided from another point of view into two varieties : (1) MUKHYA (in the primary sense, viz. following exactly the waxing and waning of the moon) and GAUNA (having a secondary or metaphorical sense ). The former is either yavamadhya or pipilikā-tanu madhya ), while the latter is of four kinds, viz, sāmānya, rsi cāndrāyana, śiśucāndrāyana and yaticandrayana. The last two will be described later. The Sāmānya (or sarvatomukha) consists in eating only 240 morsels of sacrificial food in a month of 30 days, distributing them according to one's choice (not necessarily in imitation of the phases of the moon) as stated by Manu XL220, Baud. IV.5.21, Yāj. III, 324 and the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 324), the Madana-pārijāta and other works. Here the penance, though it is not regulated by the phases of the moon, is called Candrāyana for the purpose of prescribing the same procedure and observances in it as in the Cândrāyana which follows the phases of the moon. Here the Mimānsā rule of Kupdapāyinām-ayana applies, 312 From th words of Gautama

Penance called Cāndrāyana

27.12-15 it appears that he envisaged a cāndrāyaṇa of 32 days (pipilikāmadhya) or 31 days, when he says that the performer should fast on the 14th of the bright half, eat fifteen morsels on the Full Moon day, then reduce it by one morsel, so that there is a total fast on the amāvāsyā and then on the first of the bright half one morsel is taken until on the full moon 15 morsels are taken. Thus from the 14th of the bright half ( when there is a complete fast ) to the full moon of the succeeding month there are in all 32 days and the penance is of the pipilikā-madhya type.

As regards the size of the morsels, different views are expressed. Gaut. 27.10 and Visnu Dh, S. 47.2 prescribe that the size of a morsel shall be such as not to cause a distortion of the mouth (while swallowing it). Yāj. TII, 323 allows that the morsels may be as large as the egg of a peahen, and Parāśara X.3 313 prescribes the size of a hen's egg and Sankha that of an undried āmalaka fruit ( myrobalan). The Mit. explains that Gautama's words apply to boys and young people and that the other sizes confer an option according to the capacity (sakti) of the man undergoing penance. The procedure of cāndrāyana is described in Gaut, 27.2-11, Baud. III.8, Manu XI. 221–225, Věddha-gautama chap. 16 and other works. The one given by Gautama, being pro bably the oldest among Dharmaśāstra works, is here set out.

The general rules prescribed for the Krechra penance in Gaut. 26.6-11 are applicable to Cāndrāyana also. If it is performed as a penance the performer must tonsure his hair and observe a fast on the day preceding the Full Moon. He offers libations of water, oblations of clarified butter, consecrates the sacrificial food and worships the moon, reciting apyāyasva' (Rg. I. 91, 17), ‘san te payāmsi' (Rg. I. 91.18). He shall offer clarified butter, reciting the four (ks) beginning with 'yad devā devahedanam' (Vāj. S. 20,14 or Tai. Br. II. 6. 6.1). These

four together with the preceding are seven oblations of clarified butter that have to be offered. At the end of the offering of clarified butter he shall offer pieces of sacred fuel while reciting the (eight) texts beginning with devakrtasya' (Vāj. S. VIII. 13). Each mouthful must be consecrated by (mentally ) reciting one of the 314 following words 'om bhūḥ, bhuvah, syah, tapaḥ truth, fame, prosperity, vigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, brightness, soul, dharma and siva' 315; or he may consecrate all of them at once saying 'adoration! svāhā'. The sacrificial food must be one of the following: boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley, grain separated from the husk, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, sour milk, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. Among these each succeeding one is preferable to that enumerated earlier.

JALA KRCCHRA-See under Toyakrochra,

TAPTAKRCCHRA-There is great divergence of views about this penance. Manu XI. 214, Vas. 21.21, Viṣnu Dh. S. 46. 11, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5.10, Sankha-smrti 18,4, Agnipurāṇa 171. 6-7, Atri verses 122-123, Parāśara IV.7 speak of it as of 12 days' duration comprising four periods of three days each. In this one drinks hot water, hot milk, hot ghee for three days each and then for three days there is a complete fast when he inhales hot vapour or atmosphere (acc. to Manu XI. 214). Manu adds that the performer has to bathe only once (and not thrice as in some other penances) and that he should practise self-control. Yāj. IIT, 317 (= Devala 84) speaks of this as of four days' duration, viz. he takes hot milk, hot ghee and hot water for one day each and observes a total fast on the 4th day. The Mit. on Yāj. ITI, 317 calls this mahātapta-Korcchra and also mentions a taptakrochra of two days, viz, on the first day the sipner takes all the three, viz, hot water, hot milk and hot ghee and observes a total fast on the 2nd day.

The penance Taptakrcchra

of by the Mit, has to be found out. The Pr. Prakāśa refers to a tapta-krcchra for 21 days. It may be said, as done by the Pr. Prakāśa, that the penance of tapta-krcchra for twelve days is meant for great sins and that the one for four days is meant for lesser sins. The quantity of water, milk and ghee, that was to be taken is laid down by Parāśara 316 IV. 8, Atri 123-124 and Brahmapurāṇa (q. by Pr. V. p. 511) viz. that hot water, hot milk and hot ghee should be six palas, three palas and one pala respectively. The Brahmapurāṇa adds that water, milk and ghee are to be taken respectively in the evening, morning and noon.

TULĀPURUSA KRCCHRA-Jābāli speaks 317 of the duration of this penance as eight days; Sankha (18.9-10) and Visnu Dh. S. 46.22 describe one of ten days where oil-cake, the foamy scum of cooked rice, butter-milk, water and barley meal are to be eaten, each respectively on one day, followed by a fast on the next day. Yāj. III. 322 (= Atri verses 129-130) describes one of 15 days where the above five ingredients are eaten for three days each. Yama on the other hand speaks of Tulāpurusa for 21 days, when the five things are separately eaten for three days (vide Mit on Yāj. III, 322). Aparārka pp. 1239-1241, Par. M. II. part 2 pp. 184-189, Madanapārijāta pp. 718-727, Pr. Sāra pp. 179-181 set out at length the mode of the performance of Tulāpurusa as a penance. In this penance two images of the performer made of fragrant uśīra grass were to be prepared and placed in the pan of a balance a span high made either of gold or silver or sandalwood and were to be weighed against pebbles and placed in another pan and worship was to be offered to Mahādeva and Umā and many other subordinate deities such as Agni, Vāyu, the sun.

TOYA-KRCCHRA-This is also called Varuna-krochra by Yama (q. in Pr. Prakāśa, folio 48 a) and by Sankha (q. in Pr. Sara p. 182). Visnu Dh. S. (46.14) states 318 that subsisting on nothing but ground barley mixed with water for one month is called Udakakrcchra. Since Varuṇa was regarded as the lord of waters even from the times of the Rgveda (e.g. in Rg. VII. 49. 3) and to mark the truth and falsehood among men, this Toya krochra was called Vāruṇa. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 47 b)319 quotes Jābāla to the effect 'If a sinner remains immersed in water for a whole day and night without taking food and recites mantras (addressed to Varuna) he removes by the jalakrcchra the sins which he may have committed for a year. According to Yājña valkya (q. in Pr. Sāra p. 187) this penance consists in observing a fast for a day and night standing up the whole day and passing the night without sleep in water and reciting the next day the sacred Gāyatri mantra 1008 times. According to Sankha (q. by Madana-pārijāta p. 737) this penance is constituted either by subsisting on lotus stalks grown in water or on saktus boiled in water.

DADHIKROCHRA-This is spoken of by the Pr. Prakāśa quoting from the Visnudharmottarapurāṇa as a penance in which the sinner subsists on curds alone for a month, 320

of only rice gruel, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee each for a period of three days in succession and then should observe a complete fast for three days; this is called Devakrta (performed by the gods ) penance and destroys all sins. It was practised by the Maruts, the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. By the power of this penance they became free from rajas (impurity). Thus this penance lasts for 21 days. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 48 b) refers to another variety of it and quotes a long prose passage on it, which is passed over here for want of space.

DHANADAKRCCHRA-See under Vāyavya-krochra. According to the Viṣnudharmottara 322 (q. by Pr. Prakāśa) this penance consists in subsisting for a month on food just sufficient to fill the extended but hollowed palm, mixed with gold (i. e. in which gold is rubbed or boiled).

NITYOPAVĀSA KROCHRA-The Pr. Prakāśa (p. 48 a) states that this is constituted by a man eating only twice in the day (in the morning and evening ) for six years and not drink ing even water between the two meals. 323

PANCAGAVYA-For the various details connected with pañcagavya prepared from cow's urine, dung, milk, curds and ghee, vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 773-774. Pañcagavya is to be offered into fire with the mantras 'Trāvati' (Rg. VII. 99.3), fidanı Visnur' (Rg. I. 22, 17), 'mā nastoke' (Rg. I. 114, 8), 'Sam no devir' (Rg. X. 9. 4) and then the remainder is to be drunk. It is to be drunk with the middle of a sprig of three Palāśa leaves or with a lotus leaf. Manu. XI. 165 ( = Agnipurāṇa 169. 30) prescribes this drinking of pañcagavya as the penance for petty thefts. Similarly, Yāj. III. 263 prescribes that one guilty of killing a cow should drink pañcagavya for a month. The Mit on Yāj. III. 263 quotes Viṣṇu to the effect that one who kills a cow should perform one of three penances, viz. drinking three palas of pañcagavya every day for one month or undergoing the penance of Parāka or Candrāyana, 324 Though Viṣnu 54. 7 and Atri (verse 300 ) state that a brāhmana

drinking surā and a sūdra drinking pañcagavya both went to hell (Mahāraurava, according to Visnu), yet Devala (verse 61) and Parāśara XI. 3 and 27 and medieval works like the Pr. M. (p. 13) and Sūdrakamalakara (p. 42 ) allowed śūdras to take pañcagavya without Vedic mantras. And women of all varpas, being treated like śūdras for certain purposes, were also allowed optionally to do the same.

PATRAKRCCHRA-Vide Parna-kūrca below.

PARAKA-Manu XI. 215 (= Baud. Dh. S. IV.5.16), Yāj. III. 320 (= Sankha 18.5 = Atri 128), Agnipurāṇa 171, 10, Viṣnu Dh, S. 46. 18 and Br. 325 prescribe that this penance is constituted by not taking any food for twelve days, while the performer controls his senses and remains vigilant, and that this penance removes all sins.

( PARNAKURCA-This is a more severe type of patra krochra. Yāj. III. 316 (= Devala 83) and Sankha-Likhita 326 define Parnakịcchra as one where the leaves of palāśa, udumbara, lotus, and bilva are boiled separately on each day in succession and the decoction of each is drunk on each day separately and then water in which kuśas have been dipped is drunk. Thus parnakrcchra is a penance of five days. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 316 quotes a verse of Yama to the effect that when a sinner fasts for three days and nights and thereafter he drinks together the decoctions of all the four and kusa water on the same day then the penance is called parmakūrca. The Par. M. (II, part 2 p. 181)327 regards Parnakūrca as a variety of Parna krochra. Vasistha, Jābāli and Atri (116-117) make Parṇa krcchra a penance of six days by adding the leaves of Aśvattha to the five mentioned above. Viṣnu Dh. S. 46.23 mentions another variety of Parpakrcchra for seven days. 328

PARNAKROCHRA-Vide Parpakūrca above.

PADAKRCCHRA-According to Yāj. III. 318 (=Devala 85) this is defined as a penance where a sinner takes food one day only once by day, only once by night, then once only (by day or night) but without asking for it from any one (a stranger, a servant or even his own wife) and observes a total fast for one day. Thus this penance lasts for four days. There was differ ence of view as to the number of mouthfuls to be eaten, Āpastamba (q. by Mit. on Yāj. III. 318) saying that the mouth fuls are respectively 22, 26 and 24 when food is taken only once in the evening or morning or without asking for it, while Parāśara states the number of mouthfuls to be 12, 15 or 24 respectively when food is taken only at night or in the morning or without asking for it. The Caturvimsatimata (q. by Par. M. TI part 2 p. 172) puts them as 12, 15 and 10 respectively.

PĀDONAKROCHRA--This lasts for nine days 329 only instead of the 12 days of the Prājāpatya and in it one eats by day only for three days, eats food once only for three days with out asking for it from any one and observes a complete fast for three days (i. e, three days when food is eaten by night only are omitted here).

PUSPAKRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāṇa 171. 12 and the Mit, on Yāj. III. 316 (quoting Markandeyapurāṇa) this penance is constituted by drinking for a month the decoction of flowers boiled in water, 330

PRASRTA-YĀVAKA or PRASRTIYAVAKA-- Visnu Dh. S. chap. 48 and Baud. Dh, S. III, 6 contain elaborate descrip tions (which agree with each other in many respects almost verbatim) and so does Hārīta (q. by Par. M. II. part 2 pp. 192 194) who has many sūtras and verses in common with Visnu and Baud. Prasrti means the hand with all fingers stretched out, the palm being hollowed.

out and hollowed. Some passages from Baud, who is probably the oldest of the three authors may be set out here. 331 "Now if a man feels his conscience heavy with bad actions committed by himself, let him boil for himself, when the stars have risen, a handful of barley and prepare gruel with that. Let him not perform (the Vaiśvadeva) offering with (a part of) that nor a

Bali. 332 offering. Let him consecrate the barley before it has been placed on fire, when it is being boiled and after it has been boiled with the following mantras thou art barley, the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varuna and mixed with honey, the sages have declared thee to be an expeller of all sins and a means of purification. Then there are five verses more invoking the barley grains to purify the performer from all sins whether due to deeds, words, or thoughts, to destroy distress and evil fortune, to free him from the food of ganas (guilds or multitudes of men), harlots, Sudras, or food offered at sraddhas by persons in impurity due to birth or death, food of a thief, food at navasrāddha (i. e. on 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th days after death) or from dreadful mortal sins or from guilt against children and guilt due to serving in a royal court, from sin of stealing gold, sin of the violation of a vrata or sacrificing for an unworthy person and sin of speaking ill of brāhmaṇas. Then Baud. proceeds “while the barley is being boiled he should guard it and recite Adoration to Rudra, lord of created beings; pacified

is the sky'. He should recite the text beginning with 'Krpusva pājah' (Tai. S. I. 2. 14. 1), the five sentences beginning with 'Ye devā' (Tai. S. I. 8.7. 1), the two texts 'mā nastoke' (Rg. I. 114, 8 and Tai. S. III, 4, 11, 2) and 'Brahmā devānām (Rg. IX. 96.6, Tai. S. III, 4. 11.2). “Then having sipped water he should eat a little of the boiled food after pouring it into another vessel. Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul reciting 'ye devā' (Tai. S. 1. 2. 3.1).”

Then Baud, prescribes: "one desirous of wisdom must perform this rite for three days and nights. A sinner who drinks it during six days becomes pure, he who drinks this during seven days becomes purified from the mahāpātakas, he who drinks during eleven days removes even the sins conmitted by his ancestors. But he who during 21 days drinks gruel of barley grains which have passed through a cow (i. e. cowdung) sees the Gañas, the lord of the Ganas, the goddess of learning and the lord of learning."

PRAJAPATYA-Vide under Krcchra above where it is shown that the word Krochra without any qualifying epithet means Prājāpatya. Manu XI. 211, Yāj. III. 319, Visnu Dh. S. 46. 10, Atri 119-120, Sankha 18. 3, Baud. Dh. S. IV.5.6 mention the word Prājāpatya and define it. This Prājāpatya has several varieties. The first is that described by Manu XI. 211 and Vas. 21. 20 viz. four periods of three days each following one another in which there is respectively eating once only by day, once only by night, eating once only without asking for it and complete fast. The second is that described by Vas. 23. 43. where on the first day food is taken only by day, on the 2nd only at night, on the 3rd day food got without asking for it is taken and on the 4th a complete fast is observed and where the same process is repeated for two periods of four days each. The first 333 is called Prājāpatya by 'sthānavivrddhi' and the 2nd is called 'Dandakalita'. Further, both these are said to be made kānulomyena' (by the proper and straightforward order). If the sequence described above is reversed i. e. if for three days there is first a total fast, then subsisting for 3 days on food got without asking for it, then for three days eating at night only

and for three days eating by day only, it is Prājāpatya by ‘prātilomya'. Further it may be performed with recitation of Vedic texts or without (for women and śūdras).334

PHALAKRCCHRA-Subsisting on fruits alone for a month. Vide the passage from Markandeya quoted above (n. 330). Srikịcchra mentioned below will be also phalakrcchra. The fruits of Bilva and of Amalaka and lotus seeds were the only fruits to be employed and they were to be eaten only for bare subsistence.

BALAKRCCHRA-See Siśukrcchra.

BĶHAD-YĀVAKA-The Pr. Pr. (folio 49 a) quoting Brahmapurāṇa describes it as follows:-One should feed cows on plenty of yavas anointed with clarified butter. Then he should mix water with the dung of those cows and take out the grains of barley which are voided by them after eating them. He should then dry them in the sun, should grind them on a clean stone and cook them mixed with sesame and anointed with ghee in cow's urine on a fire brought on an altar. He should place the boiled holy grains in a vessel of gold or in a cup made of palāśa leaves and present them to the gods and manes and he may eat them. He should carry this on for twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six years for the removal of all sins. This is prescribed as a penance for killing one's guru, brother, friend or a near relative &c.

BRAHMAKŪRCA-The Mit. 335 on Yājñavalkya III, 314 states that when a man fasts on one day and on the next day mixes up the ingredients of pañcagavya with Vedic mantras and drinks it with mantras it is called Brahmakurca. According to Sankha cow's urine is taken with the Gāyatri (Rg. III. 62. 10), cowdung with the mantra 'Gandhadvārām' (Tai. A. X. 1), milk with 'ā pyāyasva' (Rg. I. 91.16), curds with dadhikrāvno' (R.IV. 39. 6), ghee with Tejosi' (Vāj. S. 22. 1) and Kuģa water with devasya tvā! (Vāj. S. 22. 1, Ait. Br. 37. 3 &c.). Jābāla 336

prescribes that when a man observes a fast for the whole day and night on a day and particularly on a Full Moon day and then drinks pañcagavya the next morning this is called the rite of Brahmakūrca. Parāśara (XI. 27-28) appears to hold that Pañcagavya and Brahmakurca are synonyms. The Madana pārijāta p. 729 and Pr. Sāra. p. 189 state that the Sāntapana described by Yāj. (III. 314) is styled Brahmakūrca.337

MAHEŚVARA KRCCHRA - Vide Hemādri (on Prāyaścitta ) p. 961, which sets out a passage from Devala, that states that Brahmā prescribed it for Maheśvara on the burning of Madana, In this penance in the after-noon one should carry a broken jar (kapāla) and beg at three houses of learned brāhmanas for vegetables, offer them to God and eat them and should sleep in the evening near an idol. After getting up the next day he should donate a cow and drink pañcagavya.

MULAKRCCHRA-Visṇu Dh. S. 46. 15 340 states that it is so called when one subsists on lotus stalks alone and the Mit. on Yāj. III, 316 quotes Mārkandeya to the effect that one must subsist on mulas (edible roots) alone.

MAITRAKĶCCHRA-The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 341 53 a) mentions it. Its peculiarity is that in the Sāntapana on the third day milk of a kapilā (tawny) cow is to be partaken of. The same work notes that the Kalpataru states that this is a sāntapana in which on the first day all the six ingredients (cow's urine &c.) are taken followed by two days of fasting.

YAJŇAKRCCHRA-This is a penance for one day laid down by Angiras (q. by Pr, Sāra p. 183, Smrti-muktāphala p. 939) as follows: The sinner should bathe thrice, should be self controlled and silent; and after the morning bath he should recite the sacred Gāyatri 1008 times together with om and the Vyāhrtis at the beginning. When reciting he should be in the Virāsana 342 posture. He should drink cow's milk only once either sitting down or standing or curds of cow's milk (if he cannot secure cow's milk) or butter-milk or barley gruel mixed with cow's urine (in the absence of milk, curds or butter milk). This one-day penance called Yajña-krechra removes all sins.

YATISANTAPANA-When the ingredients 344 of Pañca gavya are mixed together (with kusa water) and drunk for three consecutive days it is Yati-santapana according to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 314. The Pr. Prakarana p. 128 adds that the three days must be followed by a fast for one day.

YAMYA.-According to Visnudharmottara-purana quoted by Pr. Prakāśa (folio 48 b) this consists in subsisting for a month on saktu grains found in cowdung.

YAVAKA-Sankha 345 (18.10-11) states that partaking of boiled yavas obtained from cowdung for a month is the Yāvaka penance for destroying all sins. The Par. M. and Pr. Prakasa quote a prose passage from Devala, 346 according to which the penance may last for seven days, a fortnight or a month and which states that the procedure of Prājāpatya will apply to this penance.

VAJRA-Atri 164 defines 347 it as a penance, where barley grains fried in clarified butter and mixed with cow's urine are partaken of.

VAYAVYA-KRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāṇa 318 and Visnudharmottara this penance consists in subsisting for a month every day on food that will just fill the extended palm.

VRDDHAKROCHRA-VRDDHI-KROCHRA-This is a penance for eight days, according to Sankha-Likhita 319 and Yama, in which one takes food only by day for two days, only by night for two days, without asking for food for two days and fasts for two days.

VYASAKROCHRA-This is the same as Maitra krochra, 350 for which see above p. 148.

SISUK RCC HRA-also called Bālakrochra by Sankha Likhita and Pādakrochra by Devala and Prāyascittamuktavali (folio 10 a) and is the same as Laghu-krcchra,351 It lasts for four days, eating once only in the day, eating once only by night, eating food got without asking for it only once on one day and fast on one day. Vide Vas. 23,43 (q. by Haradatta on Gaut. 26.5), Baud. Dh, S. II. 1. 92. Yāj. III. 318.

ŚIŚU-CĀNDRĀYAN A-Manu XI, 219, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5.19, Agnipurāṇa 171.5 state that when a brāhmana eats (for a month) four mouthfuls in the morning and four after sun-set, that is Sisu-cāndrāyana (cāndrāyaṇa for boys, old men &c.).

STTAKROCHRA-This is the reverse of Taptakrochra, as here all the articles are to be taken when they are cold 351a and not hot (as in Tapta-krcchra ). Vide Visnu Dh, S. 46.12, Agni purāṇa 171. 7 and Mit. on Yāj. III. 317. According to Visnu quoted by Pr. Sāra (p. 185) and Madana-pārijāta (p. 736) this is a penance for 10 days (and not for twelve days as the Mit. states), viz. cold water, cold milk and cold ghee are drunk three days each and there is a total fast for one day.

ŚRĪKRCCHRA-According to Visnu Dh. S. 46.16, Agni purāṇa 352 171.12 and Mit, on Yāj. III. 316 (quoting Mārkandeya) this is constituted by subsisting on Bilva fruit or lotus seeds or āmalaka fruit for a month. The Madanapārijāta (p. 737) quotes a verse of Sankha to the same effect.

SANTAPANA-Vide Mahāsāntapana and Atisāntapana above. It is of five kinds, viz, the first for two days, the 2nd for seven days, the third for twelve (Atisāntapana), the 4th for 15 days and the fifth for 21 days.

SURACANDRAYAN A--The Agnipurāṇa defines it as one where somehow or other (and not in a rising or falling scale) a man partakes of 240 morsels of food in a month. Yāj. III. 324 speaks of it as a variety of Cāndrāyana. Viṣnu. Dh. S. (47, 9) calls it'sāmānyacāndrāyana'.353

SUVARN A-KRCCHRA-Vide Hemādri on Prāyaścitta pp. 969-972 quoting Devala and Mārkandeyapurāṇa, in which a varāha or a half of it or quarter of it had to be donated. A Varāha was equal to nine rūpakas and a rūpaka was one māṣa of five guñjas (of silver it seems). For killing a brahmana secretly or for the guilt of incest one had to perform ten thousand or 40 thousand suvarna-krcchras and a lesser number for various other lapses.

SOMAYANA-According to the Madanapārijāta pp. 744 746 (quoting Hārītadharmasūtra and Mārkandeya) and Pr. Prakāśa (folio 60b) the penance lasts for thirty days divided into five periods of 7,7,7,6, 3 days, in which the milk, of all the four udders of a cow, of three udders, of two udders and of one udder is respectively drunk and for the last three days there is a complete fast. There is another variety which lasts for 24 days from the 4th tithi of the dark half of a month to the 12th of the bright half of the next fort-night; the 24 days are divided into eight periods of three days each; in the first four

periods of three days each the milk of a cow's four udders, three udders, two udders and one udder is respectively drunk and then in the next four periods of three days each the milk of one udder, two, three and four udders is respectively drunk, Vide also Prāyaścittendu-sekhara p. 12.

SAUMYAK RCCRA-According to Yāj. III. 321 this penance lasts for six days, in the first five of which one sub sists in succession upon oilcake alone, foamy scum of boiled rice alone, butter-milk alone, water alone and saktus (barley ) alone and on the last day a total fast is observed. The Mit., Madanapārijāta p. 717, Pr. Sāra p. 178 and other digests state that one has to partake of the five ingredients in quantities just sufficient to keep body and soul together. Jābāla (quoted by the Mit., Par. M. II part 2 p. 183 and others) makes it a penance of four days' duration, in the first three of which one partakes successively of oilcake, saktus and butter-milk and observes a fast on the 4th day. Atri (128-129) also mentions it. The Pr. Prakāśa (quoting Brahmapurāṇa) speaks 354 of another variety of six days' duration, on the first of which there is a complete fast and on the last of which the sinner subsists on saktus alone and in the intervening four days he subsists on the thick gruel of barley cooked in cow's urine,
