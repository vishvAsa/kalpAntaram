CHAPTER XII omodoro

THE GANGES

Since the Ganges is the holiest of rivers and since such highly esteemed tirthas as Kanakhala, Haridvāra, Prayāga and Kāśi are situated on it, it would be most proper to begin the treatment of individual tirthas with the Ganges.

1. It has been already seen (p. 556) how the Ganges is the first among the many rivers invoked in the famous Nadāstuti hymn (Rg. X.75.5-6). In Rg.1323 VI. 45.31 we have the word 'Gāngyah' which most probably means 'growing on the Ganges'. In the Satapatha Brāhmana XIII. 5.4.11 and 13 and Ait. Br. 39. 9 the victories and sacrifices of Bharata Daussanti on the Ganga and Yamunā are mentioned. In Sat. Br. XIII. 5.4.11 and 13 an ancient gātha is quoted 'At Nadapit the Apsaras Sakuntala conceived Bharata who after conquering the whole earth brought to Indra more than 1000 horses meet for sacrifice.' The Mahābhārata (Anuśāsana 26. 26-103) and the Purāṇas (such as Nāradiya, Uttarārdha, chap. 38-45 and 51. 1-48, Padma V. 60. 1-127, Agni chap. 110, Matsya chap. 180-185, Padma, Adikhanda. chap. 33-37) contain hundreds of verses eulogising the greatness and the sanctifying activity of the Ganges. The Skandapurāṇa, Kāśikhanda, chap. 29 (verses 17-168) contains one thousand names of the Ganges. It is not possible to reproduce here even a small fraction of what is said in these works about the Ganges. To most men in India great rivers like the Ganges great mountains like the Himālaya present a double aspect, viz, the physical aspect and the spiritual aspect. A great river apart from its volume of water is deemed to have a spiri tual or divine life which animates it. Tylor (in 'Primitive Culture', 2nd ed.p 477) observes 'What we call inanimate objects rivers, stones, trees, weapons and so forth-are treated as living intelligent beings, talked to, propitiated, punished for the harm they do.' There are separate treatises devoted to the glorifica tion of the Ganges and the pilgrimage to it such as the

The Vanaparva, chap. 85, has a grand eulogy of Gangā in verses 88-97, some of which may be translated here 1324. "The Ganges is equal to Kuruksetra wherever one may take a bath in it, but there is a speciality about Kanakhala and in Prayāga there is the greatest and highest (holiness). If a person, after committing a hundred bad deeds, sprinkles him self with Ganges (water), the waters of the Ganges burn all of them as fire burns fuel. In the Krta age all (places ) were holy, in Tretā age Puṣkara was (the holiest place), in Dvāpara Kuruksetra and in the Kali age the Ganges. The Ganges, when its name is uttered, purifies a sinner, when seen it yields good fortune, when a bath is taken in it or its water is drunk, it sanctifies the family up to the seventh ancestor. As long as (a particle of) the bones of a man touches Ganges water (i. e. lies inside it), so long does the man remain happy (or honoured) in heaven. There is no holy place equal to the Ganges, there is no god higher than Keśava. That country and that penance-grove where the Ganges flows should be known as the sacred spot of success (or perfection) since it attaches itself to the Ganges." The Anuśāsana (26.26, 30-31) asserts 'those dis tricts and countries, those hermitages and mountains, in the midst of which the Ganges flows are pre-eminent in punya (religious merit). Even those men who, after committing sinful acts in the first part of their lives, resort afterwards to the Ganges reach the highest world (or goal). That increase in merit) which comes to men that bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges and that then become pure in spirit, cannot be secured

In the Bhagavadgitā (X, 31) Lord Krsna says that among streams he is the Ganges (srotasāmasmi Jāhnavi). The Manusmệti setting out an exordium to a witness to tell the truth indicates that the Ganges and Kuruksetra were the most sacred spots in the age of the Manusmrti.1326 Some of the Purāṇas describe the Ganges as flowing in Heaven (as Mandākini), on the earth (as Gangā) and in the nether regions or Pātāla (as Bhogavati). Vide Padma VI. 267. 47. The Viṣnupurāṇa 1327 and other Purāṇas state that the Ganges springs from the toe-nail of the left foot of Visṇu. In some Purānas it is said that Siva let off from his matted hair the Ganges in seven streams, three flowing towards the east (Nalini, Hlādini, Pāvanī), three to the west (Sitā, Cakṣus and Sindhu) and Bhāgirathi (vide Matsya 121. 38-41, Brahmānda IL 18. 39-41, Padma I. 3. 65-66). The Kurmapurana (L.46.30-31) and Varāha (chap. 82 in prose) state that the Ganges flows first in four different streams, Sita, Alakananda, Sucaksu and Bhadrā and that the Alakanandā flows towards the south, comes to Bhāratavarṣa and falls into the sea with seven

mouths.1328 In the Brahmapurana (73. 68-69) the Ganges is described as sprung from the foot of Visṇu and as established in the matted hair of Mahesvara (Siva).

The Vispupurāṇa eulogises 1329 the Ganges as follows: The Ganges purifies all beings from day to day when its name is

heard, when one desires to see (it), when it is seen or touched or when its waters are drunk or when one plunges into it or when one takes (or sings) its name; when people utter the name 'Ganges' even though living at a distance of hundreds of yojanas, their sins accumulated in three births are destroyed.' The Bhavisyapurāṇa 1330 has a similar verse 'one becomes free from sins at once by seeing the Ganges or touching it or drink. ing its water and by uttering the name Gangā and also by remembering it.'1331 The Matsya, Kūrma, Garuda and Padma remark that the Ganges is easy of access everywhere but is difficult to reach at three places viz. at Gangādvāra (Haridvāra), at Prayāga and where it joins the sea and that those who bathe therein reach heaven and that those who die there are not born again. The Nāradiyapurāṇa, on the other hand, says that the Ganges is difficult of access everywhere, but much more so at three places. The man, whether desiring it or not, who draws near the Ganges and dies (near it) secures heaven and does not see hell (Matsya 107.4).1332 The Kūrmapurāṇa represents that the Ganges 1333 is equal to all the 35 millions of holy places declared by Vāyu in the heaven, in mid region and on the earth and that all of them are represented by the Ganges. The Padmapurāṇa asks what is the use of sacrifices rich in large wealth, what is the use of very difficult austerities when there is the Ganges honoured easily and gracefully that yields Heaven and mokṣa'? A. similar verse occurs in the Nāradiya-purāṇa 'what is the use of Yoga with its eight angas, of austerities, of solemn (Vedic) sacrifices? Residence

on the Ganges alone is superior to all these' 1334. Two verses of the Matsya-purāṇa 1335 deserve mention here even a man of sinful deeds, on remembering the Ganges even at a dis tance of thousands of yojanas, attains the highest goal. A person is delivered from sin by uttering the name (of the Ganges), on seeing it a person sees happiness; by bathing in the Ganges and drinking its water he purifies his family up to the seventh ancestor'. It is stated in the Kāśikhanda that on the banks of the glorious Ganges all times are auspicious as well as all countries, and all men are fit for receiving gifts.

In the Varahapurana (chap. 82) the name 'Ganga' is deri ved as 'gām gatā' (that has gone to the earth). The Padma purāṇa (Srstikhanda 60. 64-65) specifies the mūlamantra about the Ganges as follows : 'Om namo Gangayai, visvarupinyai nārāyaṇyai namo namah'. Koth The Padmapurana (srsti 60.35) holds that Visnu repre sents all the gods and the Ganges represents Visnu. It eulo gises the Ganges as follows: Sons abandon their fathers, wives their husbands, friends and relatives abandon a friend or a rela tive if any one of these is adulterous, or patita, or wicked or becomes a cāndāla or kills his guru, or is full of all kinds of sins and hatreds; but the Ganges does not forsake such

persons 1336

The extent of the holy region of the Ganges is laid down in some purāṇas. The Nāradiya 1337 states: the region

within one gavyūti from the banks of the Ganges is called ksetra; one should reside within the ksetra limits, but not on the bank itself; residence on the bank of the Ganges ) is not desired. The limits of the kṣetra are of the extent of one yojana between both the banks' i. e. the kṣetra extends for two krosas from each bank. The general rule is stated by Yama that forests, mountains, holy rivers and tirthas are without an owner; these cannot be possessed (by a person as owner). The Brahmapurāṇa 1338 says that measur ing from the flowing waters for a distance of four hastas, God Nārāyaṇa is the Lord (or owner) and no one should accept a gift in that strip even if he be on the point of death. A differ ence is made between the garbha (the inner circle) of the Gangākṣetra, the tīra and the kṣetra. "Garbha' extends up to that portion of the river stream which is reached on the 14th of the dark half of Bhadrapada; beyond that is the tira (bank). which extends upto 150 hastas from garbha and kṣetra extends up to two krosas from each bank.

Let us suppose that the pilgrim has come to the Ganges. Then the question is, how is he to proceed about a bath in the Ganges. Many of the digests contain several alternate forms of the sankalpa to be made at the time of Gangā-snāna. For example, the Prāyaścittatattva (pp. 497-498) contains a very elaborate sankalpa. A simple one is quoted below from the Gangāvākyāvali.1339 The mode of bathing prescribed in the

Procedure of bath in the Ganges Matsyapurāṇa 102 is common to people of all varṇas and students of all the different recensions of the Veda. The Matsyapurāṇa, chap. 102, which contains one of the earliest procedure of a reli gious bath, and which has been taken over by several digests such as the Gangāvākyāvali (pp. 148–152) is summarised here. Cleanliness (of the body) and clean thoughts do not exist without a bath; therefore bathing is first prescribed for making the mind pure. One may bathe with water drawn (in a vessel from a well or stream) or with water not so drawn. A wise man should fix upon a holy spot after repeating the funda mental mantra 'namo Nārāyaṇāya' (reverent bow to Nārāyaṇa). A man holding darbha grass in his hand and being clean and pure should perform ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water). He should select a spot four hastas square on all sides and invoke the Ganges (to come or be present there) with the following mantras 'you are sprung from the foot of Viṣṇu, you are a devotee of Viṣṇu, you worship Viṣnu; therefore save us from sins committed from birth to death. Vāyu declared that there are three and a half crores (35 millions) of holy places in heaven, on the earth and in mid air; all these, O Ganges (daughter of Jahnu), belong to you. Your name among the gods is Nandini (the joy-giving) and also Nalini and there are other names of yours viz. Dakṣā, Prthvi, Vihagā, Visva kāyā, Amộtā, Sivā, Vidyādhari, Supraśāntā, Viśva-prasādini, Kṣemā, Jāhnavi, śāntā, śāntipradāyinī. 1339a One should utter these holy names at the time of bathing; then the Ganges flowing in the three worlds would be near (even if a man bath ed at home). He should, after folding his hands, cast on his head thrice, four times, five times or seven times water on which he has muttered the mantras seven times. After having invoked the clay (in the river bed) with the mantras "O earth! Oh clay! you are crossed over by horses and chariots, by Viṣnu, remove my sin which I may have committed by my evil deeds; you were brought up (from the depths of the sea) by the Boar incarnation of Krona with his hundred hands. O clayl you are given (to the world) by Brahmā and you had mantras repeated over you by Kāśyapa. Occupying my limbs may you drive away all my sin! Oh clay! Give us

prosperity; everything is centered in you; a bow to you, that are virtuous and the source of all worlds'. Having thus bathed and having sipped water (ācamana) according to the procedure prescribed, he should get out of the Ganges and should put on two white and pure garments. Then he should perform tarpana 1340 for the satisfaction of the three worlds. (He should say) 'This water is being offered by me for satiating gods, yaksas, nāgas, gandharvas, apsarases, asuras, cruel snakes, eagles, trees, jackals, birds, creatures that sustain themselves on air and water or that move in the sky, all beings that are without support and those that are devoted to the dictates of dharma'. The person (performing tarpaṇa) should wear the sacred thread in the upavita form (when satiating gods) and then wear it in the

1340. Tarpana (satiating with the offering of water ) is of two kinds viz, principal (pradhana) and subsidiary (anga). The first has to be performed every day by a twice-born person (who has finished his studies) for the gods, sages and pitrs in that order. The 2nd is performed as an anga of snāna. Para a TATTCH Grau farnagai avui a liga Jaaaall g rup q. by THT p 162. agor is an anga of bath as well as of brahma-yajña. Tarpana has been described at great length in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 668-669 and pp. 689-695. Therefore it is not necessary to make any lengthy remarks on tarpana here. A few matters that deserve attention are mentioned, One rule is that one has to perform tarpana according to the provisions of his own recension of the Veda. The persons to whom water is to be offered and the manner in which it is to be offered are set out on p. 692 of vol. II of H. of Dh. Another rule is that tarpana has to be done (even if the day is not auspicious) at a tirtha, in Gayā, in pitrpaksa (i. e. the dark half of Bhādrapada) with water mixed with sesame 'तीर्थे तिथिप्रवेशे (तिथिविशेषे?) च गयायां प्रेतपक्षके। निषिद्धपि दिने कुर्यात्तर्पणं Tadla n. A widow also has to perform tarpana for her husband and his relatives at a sacred place. An ascetic (sannyāsin) has not to do it. A person whose father is living has not to perform tarpana, but acc. to Viṣnupurana he offers three handfuls to gods, three to the sages and one to Prajāpati (in the form devās-trpyantām'). Another rule is the one makes an offering in sraddba or into fire with one hand only (the right hand) but in tarpana water is poured into the stream in which one is bathing or on land with both hands.

Having thus bowed to the Sun and having circumambulated thrice (the lotus drawn for representing the sun) and touching a brāhmana, gold and a cow, the person (bather) should go to a temple of Visnu (or to his own house, according to another reading). 1344

It may be noted that the verses of the Matsyapurāṇa (102.2-31) summarised above occur (with slight variations of a word here and there) in Padma (Pātāla-khanda 89. 12-42) and Srsti-khanda, chap. 20. 145-176.

The Sm, C. and Raghunandana in his Prayascittatattva (p. 502 ) lay down two mantras to be recited at the time of taking a bath in the Ganges 1345 'O Ganges, daughter of Jahnu! That flowest in three worlds, that art sprung from the lotus-like feet of Visnu, that are far-famed as devoted to (the spread of) dharma, remove my sin; O divine mother, O Bhagirathi! purify with your immortal waters me who am full of faith and devotion'. The mantra to be repeated at the time of the bath at the place where the Ganges falls into the ocean according to the same two works is "O god that art the lord of rivers ! O goddess that art the best among rivers ! Having bathed at the confluence of both I shall cast off my sins".

On pp. 243-244 above it has been stated that the Visnu Dh. S, and other works recommend the casting of the ashes or charred bones of a cremated body in the Ganges at Prayaga, Kāśi or other holy place and the rites accompanying the cast ing of ashes have been there set out.

Casting ashes in the Ganges

595

ashes in the Ganges occurs in several works. The Agnipurāṇa observes the deceased man benefits if his bones are thrown into the Ganges; a man stays in heaven as long as (even a particle of) his bone remains in the waters of the Ganges. No rites for the dead are performed for those who commit suicide or who are patita; but even in their case the fall of their bones in Ganges water is beneficial to them.' The Tir, C. and Tir. Pr. quote two verses and a half from the Brahma purāṇa 1347 which set out a briefer rite of throwing ashes than the one in the Nirnayasindhu. The verses mean:"The man carrying the ashes should take a bath, sprinkle pañcagavya over the ashes, should place on them a piece of gold, honey, ghee and sesame; then he should deposit them in an earthen vessel; he should then look in the southern direction, say "salutation to Dharma,' enter the waters (of the Ganges), utter, may he (Dharma or Viṣnu?) be pleased with me and then cast the ashes in the water; then he should bathe in the river, come out of it, cast a look at the Sun and then give a present (daksinā) to a brāhmaṇa; if he does so, then the state of the deceased person will be like Indra.' Vide Skanda, Kāśī-khanda 30. 42-46 where a little more elaborate procedure is prescribed. The importance of casting ashes in the Ganges probably owes its origin to the story of king Sagara's sons who were reduced to ashes by the wrath of the sage Kapila and who were saved by the ashes being washed in the waters of the Ganges brought down from heaven by Bhagiratha. Vide Vanaparya chap. 107 109, Visnupurāṇa II. 8-10 for the story. The Nāradiya makes not only the throwing of calcined bones a source of benefit to the departed but even his nails and hair when cast in the Ganges confer the same benefit. It is stated in the Kāśikhanda that those who, while standing on the banks of the Ganges, praise another tirtha or do not think very highly of the Ganges go to hell.1347a The Kāśikhanda further provides that there is special and

The three great tirthas of Prayāga, Kāśi and Gayā are referred to as Tristhali and the great scholar, Nārāyaṇabhatta (born in 1513 A, D.), wrote (about 1580 A, D.) in Benares a famous work called Tristhalīsetu (a bridge to the Tristhali) wherein he gives a thorough and exhaustive treatment of the pilgrimage to these three holy places 1348a alone. Prayāga is assigned pp. 1-72, Kāsi pp. 72-316 and Gayā pp. 316-379 (of the Anandāśrama edition). Following with all humility the footsteps of such an illustrious and venerable scholar I shall deal with the three tirthas in the same order.

PRAYAGA

One of the most ancient reference to the greatness of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā occurs in a khila 1349 verse which is usually placed in Rg. X. 75 and may be rendered as follows: "Those who take a bath at the place where the

The त्रिस्थली. p.3 says it is a supplementary sruti text of the Asvalayana school, while the Tir. C. p. 47 quotes it as a verse of the Rgveda. It is quite possible to hold that the verse does not encourage religious suicide but only makes this distinction that by a bath only once a man goes to heaven and that if he dies at Prayaga he attains moksa even without correct metaphysical knowledge.

two rivers, white and dark, meet together, rise up (fly up) to heaven; those determined men who abandon their body there (i. e, commit suicide by drowning themselves) secure immor tality (or moksa)". This must have been a comparatively early verse. The Skandapurāṇa referes to it as śruti. The greatness of Prayāga is dwelt upon in the Mahābhārata (Vana parva 85. 69-97, 87. 18-20, Anuśāsana 25. 36-38) 1350 and in many purāṇas such as the Matsya (chapters 103-112, in all 260 verses), Kurma I. 36-39 (verses 121), Padma (I. chap. 40-49), Skanda, Kasi-Khanda, chap. 7. 45-65). Only a few out of the hundreds of verses on Prayāga can be cited here by way of sample. One remarkable fact is that the Rāmāyana does not say much about Prayāga. The confluence of the two rivers is no doubt referred to (Rām. II. 54.6) but from the des cription it appears that there was a forest at what is now Prayāga. Prayāga is called Tirtharaja (the prince among tirthas) in the Matsya 109. 15, Skanda (Kāśi 7. 45), Padma VI. 23. 27-35 (where the refrain at the end of each verse is 'sa tirtharājo jayati prayāgah) and elsewhere. The legend runs that Prajapati or Pitamaha (Brahma) performed a sacrifice here and Prayāga is the middle one of the vedis of Brahmā, the others being Kuruksetra in the north (uttaravedi) and Gaya in the east. It is believed that three rivers meet at Prayāga viz, Ganga, Yamunā and Sarasvati (underground between the two). It is said in the Matsya 1351, Kūrma and other Purānas that at the very sight of Prayāga, even by taking its name or by applying its clay to one's body a man becomes free from sin. The Kūrmapurāṇa 1352 proclaims "it is the sacred spot of Prajāpati; those who bathe here go to heaven and those who die here are not born again.” That sacred spot is known as tirtharāja ; it is dear to Keśava. The same is known as Triveni.

The word Prayāga is employed in the neuter when connect ed with such words as tirtha or kṣetra, as in Matsya (111. 14 prajāpater-idam kṣetram prayāgam-iti viśrutam), but when employed along with words (in the masculine gender) such as tirtharāja, it takes the masculine gender.

The word Prayaga is derived in various ways. The Vana parva 1353 appears to suggest that the word Prayāga is derived from the root 'yaj when it says 'Brahmā who is the soul of all beings performed formerly a sacrifice here; therefore it became known as Prayāga'. In the Skanda 1354 purāṇa also it appears to be explained by taking the two parts pra and yāga separate ly. "It is mentioned as Prayāga because it is superior to all sacrifices: Prayāga was the name given to it by the gods Hari. Hara and others seeing that it is superior to all sacrifices though the latter be enriched with fees and the like." The Matsyapurāṇa 1355 appears to lay emphasis on the part 'pra' when it says 'on account of its efficacy (or power) as compared with all other tirthas it prevails (or is useful) far more'. The Brahmapurāṇa 1356 affirms “It is called prayāga on account of its eminence and it has the word 'rāja' (in Tirtharāja) applied to it on account of its being the chief".

We must distinguish between Prayāga-mandala, Prayāga and Venī or Triveni, each subsequent one being smaller and holier than each preceding one. The Matsya 1357 states that the sphere of Prayaga is five yojanas in circumference and that the moment a man enters inside this strip of land, there is an Aśva medha at every step. This has been explained by the Tristhali setu (p. 15) as follows: Regarding Brahmayūpa (the sacrificial post of Brahmā) as the spike or peg, if one measures with a rope one and one half yojana long all round, that would be the

Boundaries and extent of Prayaga

Prayagamandala of five yojanas in circumference. The bound aries of Prayāga itself are defined by Vanaparva,1358 the Matsya purāṇa (104.5 and 106. 30) and others. 'Prayāga extends from Pratisthāna up to the pool of Vāsuki and upto the two nāgas Kambala and Aśvatara and the nāga Bahumūlaka; this is known in the three worlds as the sacred spot of Prajāpati' (Matsya 104.5), while Matsya 106. 30 provides that to the east of the Ganges is the Samudrakūpa, which is the same as Prati sthāna. This is explained by the Tristhalisetu as follows: the eastern boundary is the kūpa called Pratisthāna 1359, the nor thern one is the Vasuki pool, the western limit is formed by Kambala and Aśvatara; the southern boundary is Bahumūlaka. This would be a four-cornered space which is included within Prayāga-mandala. According to the Matsyapurāṇa as quoted by the Kalpataru on tirtha p. 143 the two Nāgas are on the south bank of Yamunā while the printed text has 'vipule Yamunātate' (106, 27) 1350. The printed text of Padma I. 43. 27 supports the Kalpataru reading ('Yamunā-daksine tate). Veni-kṣetra is within the limits of Prayāga itself and is twenty bow lengths in extent, as stated in the Padma. There are three kūpas viz. Prayāga, Pratisthāna and Alarkapura, The Matsya and Agni say 'there are three fire kundas and the Ganges flows in their midst'. It should be noted that except where special reference is made in the Purānas to the sub tirthas, the reference to a bath at Prayāga in general means bath in the Veni i. e, the confluence of the two rivers, as e g in Vanaparva 85.81 and 85 and Matsya 104.16-17, 1361

[Vol. The Vanaparva 1362 and some of the Purānas represent that the country between the Ganges and the Yamunā is (like) the hips and loins of the earth (i. e. it is the most prosperous and plentiful part of the earth) and that Prayāga is like the inmost part of the hips.

The Narasimha-purāṇa says that Visnu is in the form of Yogamūrti in Prayāga (65.17). It is said in the Matsya purana 1363 (111. 4-10 ) that when Rudra dissolves the world at the end of the Kalpa, the holy place of Prayāga is not destroyed, that Brahmā, Visnu and Maheśvara (Siva) stay in Prayāga, that to the north of Pratisthāna Brahmā stays in it under guise, that Visnu stays there as Veṇi-Madhava, that Siva stays there as the Vata (banyan tree) and that therefore the gods with the Gan dharvas, the Siddhas and great sages always protect the sphere (mandala) of Prayāga by guarding it against evil actions. The Matsyapurāṇa, therefore, recommends that a pilgrim should go to Prayāga which is protected by all the gods, stay there for a month, avoid sexual intercourse, worship gods and pitrs and thereby secure his desired objects (104.18). The same Purāṇa highly eulogises the gift at Prayāga of a kapilā cow properly decked (105, 16-22) with clothes, ornaments and jewels. The Padmapurana (Adi. 42.17-24) has the same verses as the Matsya on this subject. Similarly, the marriage of a daughter in the ārsa form at Prayaga is highly spoken of in Matsya (106. 8-9). The Matsya (105. 13-14 and 106. 10) says generally that if a man makes a gift of a cow, of gold, of precious stones, of pearls and of other things that he owns his pilgrimage becomes fruit ful (saphala) and he collects religious merit (punya) and that when a man makes gifts according to his ability and wealth, the fruit of his pilgrimage increases and he remains in heaven

Rewards of gifts at Prayāga

601

Kuruksetra, Prayaga, at the mouth of the Ganges where it falls into the sea, on the Ganges, at Puskara, at Setubandha, at Gangādvāra and in Naimisa tends to confer inexhaustible rewards. In the Vanaparva 1365 it is stated that this sacrificial ground (of Brahmā) is honoured even by the gods, that even a small thing donated here assumes greatness (i. e. produces the rewards of large gifts).

The confluence of the three rivers came to be associated with omkāra, 1366 the mystic syllable that stands for Brahma. It is said in a purāṇa passage (probably Brahmapurāṇa) that the three parts of om (a um) respectively are Sarasvati, Yamunā and Gangā and that the waters of three rivers represent Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarṣaṇa Hari. 18 It may be noted that, in spite of the fact that the Matsya, Kūrma (I. 36-39), Padma (Ādi. chapters 41-49), Agni 111 and other Purāṇas contain several hundred verses on Prayāga, the Kalpataru (on tirtha), the earliest extant digest on tirthas, quotes only the Matsya (104, 1-13 and 16-20, 105. 1-22, 106. 1-48, 107.2–21, 108. 3-5, 8-17 and 23-34, 109. 10-12, 110.1-11, 111. 8-11, in all about 151 Verses) and Vanaparva chap. 85. 79-87 and 97 and does not add a single word of explanation or discussion. But the other digests profusely quoting mostly from Purāṇas discuss at some length several topics and a few words must be devoted to some of those topics.

One such topic is tonsure at Prayāga. It is stated by the Gangāvākyāvali (p. 298) and the Tir. Pr. (p. 335) that, though the author of the Kalpataru says nothing about tonsure at Prayāga, yet as ģistas (respectable and learned people) and the writers of digests accept it as necessary, certain autho rities would be set out. The two verses quoted by most 13664 writers are one should tonsure the head at Prayāga, offer pindas at Gayā, make gifts in Kuruksetra and should commit

(religious) suicide at Benares. What is the use (or necessity) of pinda offerings at Gayā or death in Kāśi, 'or gifts at Kuruk setra, if one has tonsured one's head at Prayāga?". Elaborate discussions are held by all these works about the exact inten tion of the verses, about the application of the maxim of rātrisattra 1367 to them and about the results derived from ton sure. They have to be passed over here from considerations of space. The Tristhali-setu (p. 17) holds that the verse only prai ses the rite of tonsure at Prayāga and the fruit thereof is simply the removal of sin. The Tri. S. refutes (p. 17) the application of rātrisattra-nyāya to these verses, while Tir. C. (p. 32) applies it. Some of the conclusions drawn by the Tri.

The question arises whether in the absence of an express reward, heaven should be under stood as the reward (because as explained in Jai. IV. 3. 15-16 svarga is the

ard of all sacrifices for which no express reward is mentioned) or whether gragt (stable position ) which occurs in the above arthavāda passage should be held to be the reward of : 11HET. The reply is that here the reward is grant and not f i, e, though there is no express mention of the reward in the passage about ratrisattra, the arthavada passage should be construed as laying down the reward. In the two verses, there is a vidhi in the words प्रयागे वपनं कुर्यात् and the second verse is an अर्थवाद. The question is what reward is promised in it. If XNX ty applies, then puga secures all the fruits of गयापिण्डदान, कुरुक्षेत्रदान and काशीतनुत्याग. If it does not apply then the only fruit is पापाभाव.

Tonsure of women at Prayāga

603

relying on passages that aver that all sins cling to the roots of a person's hair, say that cutting two or three tresses would be merely kartana and not vapana (tonsure), that even women whose husbands are alive must shave themselves at Prayāga, that such women should make a braid of all their hair, should deck the braid with saffron and other auspicious materials, bow to their husbands and with the husband's permission have the head tonsured, that then they should place the cut hair in their joined hands, place thereon a golden or silver veni and pearls and coral and should cast all these into the confluence (Veni) of the Ganges and Jumnā after repeating the mantra ‘May all my sins be destroyed by this offering of my braided hair into the Veṇi! may my blessedness (the auspicious state of wifehood) always increase in the lives to come.' The Tri. S. states that women do not tonsure their head at any tirtha except at Prayāga and the only reason for this is that it is the practice of sistas. Vide above pp. 122-124 for tonsure as expiation for sins. The Nāradiya (Uttara) 63. 106 provides the same rule as Parāśara (in note 278 above) for women. The Prāyascittatattva of Raghunandana prescribes the complete tonsure of the head for women at Prayāga.

It appears probable that the provision for the casting of veṇi (braided hair) on the part of women whose husbands were alive was suggested by the word Venī applied to the confluence of the two rivers, where the river Ganges appears to make a bend or curve for some distance 1369

One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieval Indian writers was whether and when suicide, particularly at sacred spots like the confluence of the Ganges and Jumnā or at the foot of the Akṣaya Vata at Prayāga, would involve no sin 1370 This matter has already been

dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 924-928 and vol. TII. pp. 939, 948-949. Only a brief treatment by way of a summary of the pages and a few notes will be added here. The general sentiment of Dharmaśāstra works is to condemn suicide or an attempt to commit suicide as a great sin (vide H. of Dh, vol. II. page 924 for texts). The Ap. Dh. S. (I. 10. 28. 15-17) mentions the view of Hārīta which condemns suicide even as prāya Ścitta for committing a mahāpātaka (like incest) and puts kill ing another or killing oneself on the same footing. Manu V. 89 and Yāj. III. 154 condemn suicide by denying after-death rites to those who commit it, but Manu allowed suicide in various ways as prāyaścitta for mahāpātakas (vide Manu XI. 73, 90-91, 103-104). But exceptions to the condemnation of suicide are found in the smrtis, epics and purāṇas. They may be grouped under several heads. (1) Suicide as an exception in various ways by those guilty of mahāpātakas (viz, brāhmana murder, drinking of surā, theft of brāhmaṇa's gold and incest); vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 924–925 for smrti and other texts. (2) Starting on the Great Journey (mahāprasthāna-gamana or mahāpathayātrā) by a forest hermit (Manu VI, 31, Yāj. III. 55) suffering from incurable diseases and unable to perform the duties of his order. (3) An old man or one who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or who is so ill as to be beyond medical skill may kill himself by throwing himself from a precipice or by fire or by drowning or fasting or start on the Great Journey into the Himālaya or by jumping from the bran ches of the Vata tree at Prayāga (Apararka p. 877 quoting Adi-purāṇa and Atri-smrti verses 218-219 q. by Medhātithi on Manu V. 88 and Mit. on Yāj. III. 6). (4) Even a house holder, otherwise all right, may resort to suicide by the means stated (in No. 3) if his life's work is done, if he has no desire for the pleasures of the world and does not desire to live, or if he is a Vedāntin1371 and convinced of the ephemeral nature of life and may kill himself by fast in Himālaya. (5) Religious suicide

· was allowed at the confluence of the two great rivers Gangā and Yamunā, at the Vata there and at some other tirthas. (6) A wife dying by sahagamana or anumarana. As to Sati, the Nāradiya (pārvārdha 7. 52-53) provides that a woman should not burn herself on the funeral pyre of her husband if she has alus

Not only did common men believe in the pro. mise of the Purāṇas that those who killed themselves at Prayaga (at the sangama or near Vata) secured mokṣa ( freedom from the everlasting cycle of births and deaths ) which was the highest of the four puruṣārathas (goals of human existence ), but even great poets like Kālidāsa held the view that, though moksa or kaivalya or apavarga requires correct knowledge and realisation of the Supreme Spirit according to the Vedānta, Sānkhya and Nyāya systems, death at the sacred sangama led to mokṣa even without

tattvajñāna.' In H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 925-927, historical ex amples of kings such as Yasah-karnadeva, Candella Dhangadev and Cālukya Someśvara committing suicide at Prayāga or the Tungabhadrā have been given. The king Kumāragupta of Magadha is said to have entered the fire of dry cow-dung cakes. This is in accordance with the prescriptions in the Matsya purāṇa 107. 9-10 (Padma, Adi-khanda 44.3) which states 1372 "the man who, suffering from no diseases, having no deficiency as to his limbs and being in full possession of his five senses, encompasses (his death) in cowdung fire remains honoured in heaven for as many years as there are pores on the whole of his body.' 1373 The Rājatarangiṇi VI. 14 refers to officers entrusted with the duty of supervising suicide by fast (prāyopaveśa). . 1372.

(1) starving; (2) covering himself with cowdung and setting iton fire and consuming himself therein; (3) burying himself in snowu ti to plunge into water at the Gangasagara-sangama, enumerate one's sins and pray till alligators come and devour the man; (5) cut his throat Allahabad at the confluence of the Ganges and the Tumnā.

The important verse on which reliance is placed for sanctioning religious suicide at Prayāga may be translated 1374 as follows: 'You should not set aside (pass over) your wish about dying at Prayāga on account of the words of the Veda or the words of the people. The words of the Veda1375 are Vāj. S. 40. 3 (=Iśāvāsyopaniṣad 3) which literally translated means 'there are worlds of Asuras enveloped in blinding darkness; those who have killed themselves repair after death to those worlds.' This verse does not in the context appear to refer to a person committing suicide, but rather to a person who kills his soul by remaining in ignorance of the true Self. But even learned writers and poets took it to refer to suicide ( vide Uttara rāmacarita, Act IV after verse 3). Another passage of the Veda on which reliance may be placed is the one in the Satapatha Brahmana X.2.6. 7 'one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass away before the full extent of life, for it (such. shortening of full life) does not make for the (heavenly) world'. By the words of the people' are meant smrti passages con demning suicide such as Gaut. 14. 12, Vas.1375a 23. 14-15, Manu V. 88 (which says that no water is to be offered to those who kill themselves), Visnu Dh.

Suicide at Prayāga There is no doubt that some of the smrtis, the Maha bhārata 1376 itself and some puranas do recommend (or at least do not condemn) suicide in certain circumstances. A few purāṇa passages may be quoted here. Two verses of the Kūrma state 'That goal (or state), which a wise man that is devoted to Yoga and that has become an ascetic (or has forsaken "all actions) reaches, is secured by him who gives up life at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamunā. Whoever dies in the Gangā whether wilfully or unintentionally is born after death in heaven and does not see hell'.1377 The Kūrma is quite clear

Moksa may be secured or not after a thousand births else where but in Benarés moksa can be secured in a single birth' (1. 32. 22). The Padma 1378 is quite emphatic "a man who, knowingly or unknowingly, wilfully or unintentionally, dies in the Ganges secures on death heaven and mokṣa'. A verse of the Skanda asserts "He who abandons his life in this sacred place in some way or other does not incur the sin of suicide but secures his desired objects.' The Kūrma (1. 38. 3-12) refers to four modes of suicide and promises residence in heaven and various other rewards for thousands of years, viz. by (1) burn ing oneself in the slow fire of dry cowdung cakes, (2) by enter ing the water at the confluence of Gangā and Yamunā, (3) by hanging with head down in the stream and feet up and drinking

the waters of the Ganges, (4) by cutting off his own flesh and giving it as food to birds. The famous Chinese traveller Hiouen Thgang (about 629-645 A. D.) clearly refers to this practice of religious suicide (vide Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Wes tern world,' vol. I. pp. 232–234). The Kalpataru on Tirtha (composed about 1110-1120 A, D.) devotes a special section to Mahāpathayātrā (pp. 258–265). Gradually, the idea of secur ing heaven and moksa by committing suicide at Prayāga or Benares appears to have spread to other tirthas. Vanaparva 1379 speaks of suicide at Pșthūdaka (Pehova in the Karnal district of Punjab, 14 miles from Thanesar). The Brahmapurāṇa 1380 calls upon dvijas who are intent on securing mokṣa to commit suicide at Purusottama-kṣetra. The Lingapurāṇa 1381 says 'if a brāhmaṇa kills himself on Śrīśaila he destroys his sins and attains mokṣa as at Avimukta (Benares); there is no doubt about this'. The Padma promises 1382 a similar reward for suicide by fire or by fast at the confluence of Narmada and Kāverī (a small river, not the great South Indian river). dod

Gradually there was a revulsion of feeling against suicide at Prayāga or Kasi or starting on the Great Journey. Among the actions forbidden in the Kali age are included 'starting on the Great Journey' and 'suicide of old people jumping from a precipice or by fire' (vide H. of Dh, vol. III, pp. 939, 958-59). Some of the later medieval writers try very hard to combat the view that religious suicide is permitted 1383 Nilakantha, the commentator of the Mahābhārata, holds that Vanaparva 85. 83 (na vedavacanāt &c.) refers to natural death at Prayāga and not to wilful death and that the Khila verse ("Sitāsite' quoted above on p. 596) has the same meaning. Then he propounds two alternative interpretations of Vanaparva 85.

83, viz. that this passage allows those who are suffering from an incurable disease to commit suicide at Prayāga instead of dying by falling from a precipice and the like or that this verse does not apply to brāhmaṇas but only to the other three varṇas. 1384

Both the Gangāvākyāvali (pp. 304–310) and the Tīr, C. (pp. 47-52) hold that all varnas have the authority to resort to suicide at Prayaga. The Tir. Pr. holds a long, learned and highly polemic discussion on the subject of religious suicide at Prayaga (pp.346-355). Its own view appears to be that a brāhmana should not commit this suicide at Prayaga on account of the prohibition contained in Kalivarjya verses and that members of the other varnas may do so. The Tristhalisetu algo enters upon a long discussion (pp. 47-55) and its conclu sions are that in suicide at Prayāga for the attainment of moksa or other rewards (such as heaven) there is no sin, that this suicide at Prayāga is not forbidden 1384a to brāhmanas as some think (since Agni 111. 8 reads 'na vedavacanād vipra'), that persons whether seriously ill or in good health 1385 may resort to suicide at Prayāga, that no one has authority to commit suicide at Prayāga after abandoning to their fate one's old parents, young wife and children that require support, nor should a woman who is pregnant or who has young children or who has no permission from her husband, commit suicide at Prayaga.1386 It is refreshing to find Narayanabhatta, perhaps

the most learned and renowned Pandit of his age steeped in all the lore of ancient India, make, in spite of the overwhelming weight of śāstric authority in favour of suicide at Prayāga, exceptions that surely appeal to reason, sentiment and common. sense.1387 Nārāyanabhatta probably followed traditions several hundred years older than his times. Alberuni in his work on India composed about 1030 A. D. says about religious suicide that it was resorted to by those who are tired of life, who are distressed over some incurable disease, some irremovable bodily defect or old age or infirmity. This however no man of distinction does, but only vaiśyas and sūdras. Burning oneself is forbidden to brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas by a special law. Therefore these if they want to kill themselves do so at the time of an eclipse in some other manner or they hire somebody to drown them in the Ganges.' (tr. by Sachau, vol. II, p. 170). The Tri. S. S. provides that a man desirous of committing religious suicide at Prayāga should first perform a prāyaścitta,

should perform his own grāddha upto the offering of pinda if he has no relative entitled to perform it, should fast that day, should make a sankalpa next day preceded by a writing (to inform people of his desire to die in that way) and enter the holy waters contemplating on Viṣnu. On his death, his relatives have to observe āśauca only for three days and not for ten) and on the 4th day the śrāddhas of the 11th day are to be performed for him.1388 Jom The psychological background behind the religious suicide at Prayāga and other places is not difficult to realise. Centuries of philosophical thought had made a very deep impression on the minds of all people that the soul has to subniit to a never-ending cycle of births and deaths. Ancient scriptures had offered a release in two ways viz. by tattvajñāna and by suicide at a tirtha. Death had no great terror for the pilgrim who submitted to various inconveniences and priva tions ungrudgingly. If one is determined to put an end to samsāra by taking one's life, what nobler environment could have been imagined or indicated than at Prayāga, where two mighty rivers flowing from the sacred Himalaya unite and carry on unceasingly their work of fertilizing the land and bringing prosperity and solace to millions of needy and anxious people ?

While on this topic of religious suicide, it would not be out of place to briefly refer to the discussion in the digests about the meaning of the statement in the purāṇas that those who die at Prayaga are not born again (e. g. Matsya 180.71 and 74). The answer is foreshadowed in the Matsyapurāṇa itself (182. 22-25) which 1389 says: At the time of death, when the vital

parts of the human body are being shattered, memory must fail a human being that is about to be pushed on (to another body) by the vital breath (when it leaves the mortal coil). But at the time of death in Avimukta (Vārāṇasī) Lord (Śiva) himself whispers (higher knowledge in the ears of his devotees that are about to be pushed into new bodies) by (accumulations of their actions). A man dying near Manikarnikā pool reaches the desired goal; he being guided by the Lord reaches the goal which is difficult of attainment by those whose minds are not pure.' In the Kāśikhapda it is expressly stated that mokṣa does not directly result in these cities (viz. Kaśī &c.). But in spite of these warnings the popular belief fostered by the literal mean ing of hundreds of Purāṇa passages is that moksa results from dying at Prayāga or in Kāśiksetra.

The practice of religious suicide has a very respectable antiquity. In the 4th century B. C. Kalanos, the Indian Gymnosophist from Taxila who had accompanied Alexander from India, burnt himself alive on a funeral pyre at Sousa, when being over 70 years old, he was afflicted with a malady that made life more and more burdensome. Vide J. W. McCrindle's 'Invasion of India by Alexander the Great' (New Edition 1896) pp. 46, 301, 386-392. Strabo informs us of a gymnosophist from India named Zarmanochegas of Broach who accompanied an embassy to Augustus Caesar at Athens and consigned himself to flames (vide 'Invasion of India by Alexander' p. 389). Hiouen Thsang (Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Western World' vol. I. pp. 232-234) refers to suicide at Prayāga. The Jains, while on the one hand they laid the greatest emphasis on 'ahimsā' (non-injury), encouraged reli gious suicide (called 'Sallekhana') in certain cases 1390.

Some of the works, viz. the Kasimrti-mokṣa-vicāra of Sureśvara (pp. 2-9), the Tristhalisetu (pp. 50-55) and the Tirthaprakāśa (pp. 313-318) discuss at some length how mere death (either involuntary or voluntary) in Vārānasi or Prayaga would lead to mokṣa. Considerations of space prevent a complete statement of their views. Their arguments are briefly as follows:Karma is of three kinds, viz. sancita (col lected in former births), prārabdha (that has begun to

operate by giving the soul the present body) and kriyamana (to be done in this body and in future). The Upaniṣads and the Gita,1391 declare that, just as waters do not stick to a lotus leaf, so evil deeds do not cling to a man who knows this (knowledge of brahma), that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all karma and that mokṣa results from the realization of the Supreme Spirit (Vedānta-sūtra IV. 1. 13). From this it follows that a man who has realized the Highest Reality will not be affected by the acts done by him after realiza tion and his accumulated actions (sañcita) will be des troyed by that realization. The present body in which the soul realizes brahma was due to that part of his karma which had begun to operate. When the present body perishes in the case of a man who has realized brahma he attains final release, since no actions remain for producing effects. To the man who dies a natural death in Benares is given at the time of death the Taraka (saving) mantra.i-The Matsyapurana says:1392 those who enter fire according to the rules in Avimukta (i.e. Benares) enter the mouth of Siva and so also those determined devotees of Siva who die by fast in Benares do not return (to this world) even after millions of kalpas. Therefore all those who die in any way at 1393 Benares receive Grace from Siva after their death. That leads to tattvajñāna (correct spiritual knowledge) which leads to moksa. In rare passages it is expressly stated that mokṣa cannot 1394 be immediately secured

(by dying) in these cities. The Tāraka-mantra is variously explained. According to Sureśvara, Tāraka-mantra is the mystic syllable om which is a symbol of brahma as stated in the Tai. Up. (I. 1.8 Om-iti brahma) and the Gītā (8. 13 Om ityekākṣaram brahma). The Tri. S. gives another explanation besides this. According to Rāmatāpaniya Upaniṣad and 1395 the Padmapurāṇa the mantra is 'sri-Rama-Rāma-Rāmeti.'

There are several sub-tirthas that fall under Prayaga. The most important of them is the famous Vata (banyan tree) called Akṣaya-Vata (the imperishable Vata). The Agni (111. 13) states 'if a man dies at the foot of the Vata and in the Sangama he goes to the city of Viṣnu'. Special reference is made to abandoning one's life at the foot of the Vața. The Kūrma1396 says 'He, who abandons life at the foot of the Vata, passes beyond heavenly worlds and goes to the world of Rudra'. The following are the sub tirthas of Prayāga and only references are given to the works in which they are described : (1) the two Nāgas called Kambala and Aśvatara which according to some are on the spacious (vipula) bank of the Jumnā and according to others on the southern bank of the Jumnā (Vanaparva 85.77, Matsya 106. 27, Padma, Adi 39. 69, Agni 111.5, Kūrma I. 37. 19), (2) Pratisthāna on the eastern side of the Ganges, being the same as the Sāmudra-kūpa (Vana parva 85.77, Matsya 106. 30, Kūrma I. 37.22, Padma, Adi. 43, 30; Vanaparva 85.114 appears to suggest that Pratisthāna is another name of Prayāga; (3) Sandhyāvata (Matsya 106.43, Kūrma I. 37.28, Agni 111. 13); (4) Hamsaprapatana to the north of Pratisthāna and to the east of the Ganges (Matsya 106.32, Kūrma I. 37, 24, Agni 111.10, Padma, Ādi 39.80 and 43.32; (5) Koțitirtha (Matsya 106. 44, Kūrma I. 37.29, Agni 111. 14, Padma, Adi 43.44; (6) Bhogavati, the Vedi of Prajāpati to the north of Vāsuki (Vanaparva 85.77, Matsya 106.46, Agni 111. 5, Padma, Adi 39. 79 and 43,46; (7) Daśāśvamedhaka (Matsya 106.46, Padma, Adi 39.80); (8) Urvaśīpulina, suicide at which

Padma, Adi 43. 34-43, Agni 111. 13, Kurma I. 37.: 26-27);: (9) Rṇapramocana, on the northern bank of Yamunā and to the south of Prayaga (Kurma I. 38. 14, Padma, Adi 44.20); (10) Mānasa on the north bank of the Ganges (Matsya 107.9, Padma, Adi 44.2, Agni 111.14); (11) Agnitirtha on the southern bank of the Jumnā (Matsya 108. 27, Kūrma I. 39.4, Padma, Adi 45. 27); (12) Viraja on the north bank of Yamuna (Padma, Adi 45.29); (13) Anaraka 1399 to the west of Dharmarāja (Kūrma I. 39.5).

The Puranas lay down that if a man starts on a pilgrim age, but dies on the way to Prayāga he reaps great benefits even without reaching it, provided he dies remembering

Prayaga. The Matsyapurana (105.8-12) asserts : 1400 A man whether in his own country or house or after leaving his country dies in a forest, while remembering Prayāga, he still secures the world of Brahma; he reaches a world where the

trees yield all desires, where the earth is full of gold and where there are sages and munis and siddhas; he dwells on the bank of the Ganges full of thousands of women and enjoys the company of sages; when he comes down from heaven he becomes the lord of Jambūdvīpa.

At most famous tirthas the pilgrim has to perform śrāddha, The Visnu Dh. S. (chap. 85) mentions about fifty-five sacred places which are fittest for śrāddha. The Kalpataru (on tirtha), the Gangāvākyāvali, Tir. C. and other digests quote several verses from the Devipurāṇa, the gist of which is as follows : Srāddha should be performed at tirthas, but there is no offering of arghya and no āvāhana (since pitrs are deemed to be always present at tīrthas, as the Kāśikhanda says) nor is the entering of the thumb of the invited brāhmaṇa into the food served done, nor is there the question about the brāhmaṇas being satiated, nor vikira 1401 If one is unable to follow the complete procedure of śrāddha one should merely offer pindas made from barley meal or may offer samyāva (cake of wheat flour fried with ghee and milk), rice boiled in milk, the cake of sesame (after the oil is extracted) or jaggery.1402 It should not be allowed to be seen by dogs, crows and vultures, it may be offered at any time after the pilgrim reaches the holy place. A śrāddha performed at a holy place gives great satisfaction to pitrs. Some of the works such as the Tristhalīsetusārasangraha of Bhattoji provide that after performing a pārvanaśrāddha at a tirtha and after making offerings of pindas to one's ancestors one should offer a single piṇda to one's other relatives with the following mantra : "Here I offer pinda to deceased persons of my father's family, and of my mother's family and to the deceased relatives of my guru and of my father-in-law, to those men of my family

who were devoid of sons or wives and so who would lose the benefit of the pinda (to be offered by the son or wife) and in the case of whom all rites after death have ceased, those who were blind from birth or were cripples, those who were mal formed or died in the womb; to all these, whether known or unknown to me, may this (pinda) reach inexhaustively'! (Vāyu 110. 51-52). After this he should offer another pinda for his servants, slaves, friends, dependents, pupils, persons who conferred obligations on him, cattle, trees and those with whom he came in contact in other lives (Vāyu 110. 54-55). If a person is ill or has not the time to go through this elaborate pro cedure, then he should make a sankalpa that he would perform śrāddha and should offer a single pinda with the mantra (in Vāyu 110. 23-24) 'I offer this pinda to my father, grand-father, great-grand-father, to my mother, father's mother, grandfather's mother, to my maternal grandfather and to the latter's father and grandfather. May it reach them inexhaustively'!

The Anuśāsana-parva, the Kūrmapurāṇa, Nāradiya (uttara) 63. 19-20 and 36-38 and others highly praise bathing at the sangama in the month of Māgha 1403 Men of all castes, women and those born of mixed unions can take this bath; sūdras, women and men of 'mixed castes should not repeat any mantra but should bathe silently or with the word 'namah' (Tri. S. p. 39). Similarly, the Padma, Kūrma, Agni and other Purānas wax eloquent over a bath for three days in Māgha saying that it is equal to the gift of three crores of cows. 1404 There is great divergence as to exactly what three days are meant, as pointed out by the Tri. S. p. 33. The various views are: the three days are the passage of the sun into Capricornus, Rathasaptami and the full moon day of Māgha; the three consecutive days including the 10th of the bright half of Māgha; the first three days of Māgha; the three consecutive days from the 13th day of the bright half of Māgha; any three days in Māgha.
