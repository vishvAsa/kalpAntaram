16. Atri That Atri was an ancient writer on hurma follows from & reference to him in Manu (III. 16 ) as holding the view that a crijati taking as wife a sūdra woman became fallen (patita). In the Deccan College collection there are several mss. ( Nos. 185-187 of A 1881-82 ) of the Atreyadharmaśāstra in nine adhyayas. They trent of gifts, prayers (japya ) and tupus by which men are free from all sins. Some of the chapters are in mixed prose and verse. The first three chapters are entirely in verse and some of the verses (such as ekāksaram param brabma) occur in the Manusmști. The fourth opens with a long sūtra, which, in style, resembles later bbāsyas and com mentaries, 320 The 5th also is in verse and contains several verses found in Viisistha ( Dh. S. 28. 1, 4, 6). The sixth speaks of the specially boly hymns and verses of the Veda. Some of the verses here are the same as Vasistha ( 28. 10–11). "The seventh refers to secret prayascittas and the very first sūtra after the opening words sj.eaks of several non-Aryan tribes 230 such as the Sakas, Yavanas, kambhojus, Balbikas, Khusus, Vangus aud Pārasu ( Persians ? ) &c. It is to be noted that the saine sutra ( with slight variations ) is quoted as Atri's by Apariirka (on Ynj. III. 266 p. 1123). The 7th aud 8th chapters are in inixed prose and verse. The 9th is in verse and speaks of Yoya and its unyus. It refers to the fact that Sisupūlu, son of Damaghosa, because in his hatred of Govinda he always thought of the latter, went to heaven. The same sutra work is noticed in I. O. Cat., pp. 380-81, Nos. 1305 and 1306.

There are several works styled Atri-smrti or samhitā in the mss. One of them is in six chapters on secret prāyścittas, gifts, pitṛmedha and ācāra ( vide I. O. Cat., p. 381, No. 1308). There is another work styled Atrisaṁhitā printed in Jivanau da's collection (part I. pp. 13-46). It contains about 400 verses and deals with the following topics :- importance of honouring guru; duties of four castes; purifications of seveaal mnulus ; virtues of Brāhmanas such as saucu, anusīyā; defini tion of iṣta and pūrta, ten yamas and niyamas; importance of sons; adopted sons; prāyaścittas for taking forbidden food or drink and for other transgressions ; impurity on birth and death; cāndrāyana, Kłchra, Sānta pana ; gifts ; purifications from avoidable contacts with rajasvalā &c. ; Srāddha and the brābmaṇas to be invited for it. 

In this work Atri is himself cited as an authority. Other authors and works quoted are: Apastam ba ( p. 30), Yama (p. 41 ), Vyāsa ( p. 24 ), Saṅkha ( pp. 22, 35), Śatātapa (p. 35). The Vedānta, Sārikhya, Yoga, Puraụas, Bhagavatāḥ (p. 45 ) are mentioned. It contains (on p. 14) the verse 'sadyaḥ patati mānsena' which is found in Vasistha Dh. S. (2.27) with the words 'athāpyudābaranti'. There are other verses also which occur elsewhere e. g.'atha cen-mantravid' occurs in Vasistha 11. 20, 'tryaham prātah' (p.23 ) is ulso Manu XI. 211. On p. 26 occur the words 'utrāpyudāharanti’and so what follows is a quotation. On p. 32 there are three verses in another metre. 

Atri’s verse about adoption 31 is quoted as the first autho rity on adoption in the Dattakamimāinsa. He mentions the seven urtyajas to be the washerman, the shoemaker, natu, buruda, kaivarta (fisherman ), meda and bhilla (p. 29). He further says232 that there is no question of untouchability in fairs, marriage seasons, in Vedic sacrifices and in all festivals. He says that Brāhmaṇas from Magadha, Mathurā and three other places are not honoured ( at a śrāddha) though as lear ned as Bṛhaspati.283 231 zgatal adem: gaasaiara: Ti frost. ETHITH Ra: 11

The work mentions the signs of the Zodiac, Kanyā and the Scorpiou (1"43 ), and hence was not composed before the first centuries of the Christian era. 

In Jivananda there is a Laghu-Atri (part I, pp. 1-12 ) in 6 chapters and about 120 verses, dealing with the means of being freed from gins (such as prānīyāma, sucred formula, gifts &c. ), with purifications from impurity on death and birth, with gifts. It mentions Manu. In the fourth chapter there are about ten lines in proge. There are numerous verses that occur also in the Vasistha-dharmasūtra, e. g. Vas. 26. 8-9 and 16-18 occur on p. 3 ; Vas. 28. 11.16 occur on pp. 4-5. It is difficult to say who the borrower is. 

There is a Vrddhatreyasmrti in Jivananda (part I. pp. 47-59 ) in five chapters and about 140 verses. This closely resembles the Laghu-Atri-smrti described above. In the commencement both have the same six verses beginning with 

bhagavan kena dānena' and the works have many verses in common. In the fourth chapter of both the same prose passa ges occur. 

Viśvarūpa on Yāj. (III. 257 ) quotes two verses from Atri on prāyaścitta which are found in none of the three works described above. 234 

In the Mahabharata (Anuśāsana 65. 1 ) Atri is credited with the view that those who make a gift of gold give (prac tically) all objects. This bears a close resemblance to two verses that occur in Laghvatri (Jivananda part I. p. 5) and Vṭddhātri (part I. p. 51 ).235
