CHAPTER XXIV 

Influence of Purāṇas on Dharmasastra 

Literary works and society act and re-act on each other. The state of Indian society & few centuries before and after Christ, riven as it was by the growing strength and onslaught of Buddhism, Jainism and other dissenting sects and disturbed by invasions of the Greeks, Sakas, Pahlavas, Hūpas and other foreign tribes, gave much food for thought to those who were devoted to the Vedic religion and induced them to write works setting forth new ideologies and practices and effecting a re statement of the ancient Vedic and Smrti religion. When these works attained a position of authority and eminence, the endea vour of the followers of the Veda was to follow them as far as possible and to adapt their practices and religious rites to the requirements of the Purāṇas. We have to see how the Purāṇas Bet about their task of re-orientation. We must note that current Hindu religious practices, judging from the saṅkalpa made at the beginning of every rite, are meant to confer upon the per former the rewards declared by Śruti (Veda), Smrti and Purāpas (Sruti-smrti-purāpokta-phalaprāptyartham). The task was two fold, viz. (1) to undermine the power and prestige of Buddhism and Jainism and the influence of the numerous philosophical 1447 schools that had sprung up and (2) to wean away large sections of the masses from the attractive features of Buddhism and to convince them that they could secure in the re-orientated Hindu faith the same benefits, social and spiritual, as Buddhism promised and that the religious principles of the followers of Veda coincided with many of the teachings of Buddhism and were borrowed by Buddhism from Vedic practices. Ultimately Buddhism vanished from the land of its origin. The main causes of this disappearance of Buddhism from Bhārata will be stated at the end of this section, but this much may be said here at once that the Purāpas played a substantial role in bring 

1447. It is stated in the Mabāvagga (part of Suttanipāta) that there were 63 philosophical schools at the time of Buddba (vide SBE vol. X. part 2 p. 92).

ing about the decline and disappearance of Buddhism by emphasizing and assimilating some of the principles and doctrines of Buddha 1448 such as ahiṁsā, by accepting Buddha himself as an avatāra of Viṣṇu, by adopting vegetarianism as a high form of austerity, by making use of monasteries and asceticism as stated in such smṛtis as those of Magu and Yāj. 

The Purāṇas set about their task by saying that for the proper understanding of the Veda, knowledge of Itihāga and Purāṇa was essential. A famous verse says 1449 'one should strongthen the Veda by (the study and application of) Itihāsa and Purāṇa; the Veda is afraid of the person of little learning (with the thought) that he (the man of small learning) may harm it'. Manu states 1450 that those brāhmaṇas that have learnt according to the rules (of Veda study) the Veda together with the works that strengthen it are to be understood as sistas and are instrumental in making (the meaning of) the Veda clearly perceptible. The Vayu 1451 emphasizes in this connection that that brāhmaṇa who knows the four Vedas together with (the six ) ancillary lores and the Upaniṣads would not be a wise man if he did not know Purāṇas. The Upaniṣads drop brief hints about the creation of ākāśa from the one brahma (in Tai. Up. II, 1), of tejas (Chān. Up. VI. 2. 3), of waters (Chān. Up. VI. 2.4).

Naciketas that ocour in the Ait. Br. and the Kathopadiṣad are explained at length in Brahmapurāṇa (chap. 104 and 150 about Hariscandra), in Sabhāparva chap. 12 (for Hariscandra) and in Anuśāsana chap. 91 (for Naciketas). The famous dialogue of Yama and Yami (Rg. X. 10) is expanded in the Narasimha purāpa (chap. 13. 6-36). The Viṣṇupurāṇa 1452 (IV. 6. 34 ff) sets out the story of Purūravas and Urvaśī, refers to the hymn in the Rg. X. 95 for that story and quotes the first verse of the hymn in a somewhat corrupt form. 

But the claims of the extant Purāṇas go far beyond the above viz. as strengtheners of the Veda. The Kūrma 1453 states: '(put) on one side all the Purāṇas together with Itihasa (Maha bhārata) and on another the highest Veda; it is this (Puranas) that surpasses (the other viz. Veda)'. The Mahābhārata also makes a similar claim. The Purāpas appear to claim priority (and even equality ) with the Veda. In note 1349 passages from the Matsya and other Purāṇas have been cited, stating that Brahma first thought of the Purāpas before all other śāstras and then the Vedas sprang forth from his lips. Several Purāṇas ara spoken of as equal to the Veda (Vedasammita) as in 1154 Vāyu I. 11, 4. 12, Brahma 1. 29, 245, 4 and 21, Viṣṇu I. 1. 13, VI. 8.1%, Padma VI. 282. 116. Further, several Purāṇas claim to have been delivered by some God such as Brahma (Brahmapurāṇa I. 30) or by the Wind-god (Vāyu I. 196 )1455 or by the avatāras of Viśṇu as in the case of Matsya-purāṇa (I. 26 ) or Varāha (2. 1 3). The japa of Vedic texts was deemed to destroy all sins as shown in H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 45-50. The Purāṇas also say that reading the Purāpas or listening to a recitation of them

Some of the Purāṇas indulge in extravagant praise of themselves, e.g. the Varāha-purana ( 217. 12-13, 217.15-16) states that reading ten chaptors of that Purāṇa confers the merit secured by the performance of Agnistoma and Atirātra sacrifices. Vide Brahma 254, 34-35, Agni 384. 13-30, Devi-Bhāgavata XII. 13. 11-17 in a similar strain. Moreover, the Purāṇas dwell upon the superior value and officacy, as compared with the Vedic sacrifices, of some of the institutions on which they lay emphasis, such as pilgrimages,1357 vratas, bhakti. The Padma states (I. 38.2 and 18) that by merely going to Gayā or by taking a bath in the Phalgu river one secures the reward that the performance of Aśvamedha confers. The Skanda proclaimg 1-458 'I have no use for sacrificial rites that are declared by the Veda, that have no life in them, that are within the domain of ignorance and that ontail injury (to animals). If (a sacrifice) is performed with such inanimate things as fuel-sticks, flowers and kusa grass, the result must be similar (inanimate), since the effect is like the cause'. Vide Santiparva 337 for a story on the discussion between sages and gods about offering in sacrifices merely pro ducts of grains or goat-flesh. Offerings of flesh in sacrifices to gods were made in the Rgvedic period. But even in the Rgveda there are a few verses that indicate that offerings of gheo and fuel-sticks were declared to be able to win the favour of gods as much as animal sacrifices might do. Whoever 1159 offers to (or worships) Agni with a fuel-stick or with an oblation of ghee or

with (the study of) the Veda or who performs a good sacrifice with prostrations, for him alone run fleet horses and his is most brilliant fame; and no ovil whether brought about by gods or by men might reach him from any side'. Another mantra 1960 gays 'O Agni! we bring to you an offering accompanied by a śkmantra fashioned (or produced) by our heart. May those mantras be oxen, bulls and cows from you'. 

The Purāpas only pursue an attitude to Veda and sacrifices that is found in some of the Upaniṣads. The Mundakopaniṣad1461 says: 'one should know two vidyās (lores ), parā (the higher) and apara (the lower); the latter comprehends the four Vedas and Phonetics, aphorisms about solemn saorifices, grammar, Nirukta (derivation of words), metres, astronomy; while the highest lore is that whereby the Imperishable (Reality) is known'. The same Upaniṣad condemns aparā-vidyā when it says "These sacrifices are infirm (leaky ) boats constituted by eighteen ( persons) depending on which are declared actions that are inferior; those foolish people who welcome these actions as the highest good become subject again to old age and death'. The Kathopaniṣad 1462 states that what are known as avidya and vidyā are far apart from each other, are contradictory and lead to different results. When Nārada approached Sanatkumāra and requested the latter to teach him, the latter said to him 'tell me what you know and then I shall tell you what is beyond that.' Then Nārada stated that he know all the four Vedas, Itihasa-purāṇa the fifth Veda and several other loros, whereupon Sanat-kumāra told him that the four Vedas and the other lores he had learned were merely a name and then he led Nārada gradually to the understanding of the Highest Self. The Bṛ. Up. I, 4, 10 condemns him, who worships & deity thinking he is different from the devatā, that he does not know the truth, that he is like & ( sacrificial) animal to the gods. Similarly, in

History of Dharmadāstra (Soc. V, Ch. XXIV 

several passages of the Upaniṣads austerities, liberality, straight forwardness, ahimsā and truthfulness are put forward as equal to or superior to the actual performance of the ceremonial of sacrifice (yajna); vide Chāndogya III. 17. 4, Praśna I. 15, Muṇdaka I. 2. 11. 

Though in a few passages of the Upaniṣads the knowledge of the Highest Self is put higher than the four Vedas, the Upa niṣads generally treat the Vedas as authoritative and quote Vedic verses in support of their statements. For example, the 

Ait. Up. II. 5 quotes Rgveda IV, 27. 1 (taduktam-sșiṇā-Garbhe : nu &c.), Praśnop. I. 11 quotes Rg. I. 164, 12 (pañcapadam 

pitaram), Bș. Up. II. 5. 15, 17 and 19 quote respectively Rg. I. 116. 12, I. 117. 22, VI. 47.18 (rūpam rūpam pratirūpo). The Upaniṣads further emphasize 1463 that brahmavidyā is to be imparted only to those who are śrotriya ( who have studied the Veda), who engage in their duties and who bave properly per formed Sirovrata. The Bp. 1464 Up. shows that Veda study, sacrifices, charity &c. are preparations for the knowledge of brahma: 'Brāhmaṇas (and others ) desire to know this ( great Self) by study of the Veda, by sacrifices, gifts, tapas, fasting'. These passages make it clear that study of the Veda and per formance of sacrifices enjoined by it are accepted by the Upa niṣads as preparatory and as cleansing the mind of its lower passions and as making a person worthy of receiving the know ledge of the highest truth about the One Supreme Spirit and that the Upaniṣads do not altogether condemn and give up the Vodas and sacrifices, 

The Puranas adopt, in spite of the claims made by them here and there about their priority to the Vedas, about their own value and efficacy, the same attitude towards the Veda as the Upaniṣads do. They treat the Vedas as authoritative and enjoin

the employment of Vedic mantras in many rites. The author contributed a paper to the Dr. Kunhan Raja Presentation volume pp. 5-8 on the Vedic mantras and legends employed in Purāṇas' citing illustrations from the Brahmapurāṇa. A few illustrations from other Purāṇas may be set out here. The Matayapurāṇa (chap. 93) when describing the procedure of the homa to the nine planets prescribes nine Vedic mantras, five of which are different from those provided by Yāj. (I. 300-301). Vide p. 750 above for a comparative table of the two sets of mantras. In the Udvahatattva 1465 Raghunandana remarks that the mantras 'ā krspeda' and others are common to persons following the four Vedas and that Bhavadevabhatta held the same view. Matsya prescribes that when inauspicious birds (like an owl) or animals cry near a house or enter it, a homa should be performed, or five brāhmaṇas should engage in a japa 1466 of the hymn beginning with 'Duvāḥ kapota'(Rg. X. 165. 1-5). In describing the whole procedure of the establishment of images of gods or the linga (of Śiva), the Matsya (chapter 265 ) prescribes numerous Vedic verses and hymna for the different parts of the ceremony. For example, for bringing about the purification of the image four mantras are presoribed viz. Rg. VII49. 1-3 and X. 9.1; in providing for the placing of a jar full of water near the head of the bed on which the image is to be placed, two mantras Āpo devi' (Vāj. S. 12.35, Tai. S. IV. 2.32 ) andāpo asmān mātarah' (Rg. X. 17.10 ) are to be recited. Matsya ( 265.24–29) prescribes for the japa of several sūktas (hymns) by four door-keepers learned in the Vedas that are to stand in the four main direo tions. The Agnipurāṇa (41.6-8) providing for the laying down of baked brick or stones in building a temple proscribes the Tecital of many Vedic mantras, viz. Kg. X. 9.1-3, Rg. X. 9.4, Rg. IX. 58. 1-4, Pāvamāni veraes (either Rg. IX. 1. 1-10 or verses from Rg. IX), Rg. I. 24. 15, Rg. IV. 31. 1, Vāj. S. IV. 36 (Varupasya), Rg. IV. 40.5 and the Srīgākta (of 29 Verses

beginning with 'Hiraṇyavarṇam harinim'). The Nāradiya purāṇa ( II. 73. 83-90) contains at end of each of the verses parts of vedio prayer, which ooour in Rg. VII. 66. 16, Tai. Ār. IV. 4. 2-5 and Vaj. S. 36. 24; Bhāgavata I. 2. 21 (bhidyate &c.) is taken from Mundaka Up. II, 2.8. 

The Purāṇas not only prescribe Vedic mantras for various purposes, but suggest the employment of numerous Paurāṇika mantras. It appears that Paurāpika mantras came to be employed along with Vedic mantras in religious rites even of Brāhmaṇas at the beginning of the Christian era or within & few centuries after Christ. Yāj. I, 229 prescribes that the Visve Deyas should be invited to come to a sraddha with the çk, 'O Visve-Devas! Come, listen to this my call, sit down on these kuśas' (Rg. II, 41. 13). On this the Mitākṣarā (about 1100 A. D.) remarks that along with the Vedic mantra mentioned by Yāj. & smārta mantra should also be employed viz. the mantra1467 'āgacobantu mahābhāgā,' which occurs in Skanda and Garuḍa purāpa. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 440 note 984 for the ascrip tion of this verse to various authorities. The Vayupurāṇa 1468 prescribes that the mantra' adoration to the devatūs, to pits, to the great Yogins, to stadha and svāhā; they are always present' should be recited thrice at the beginning and at the end of brāddha and at the time of offering pindus; the pitļa quiokly come when the mantra is repeated and goblins run away; this mantra protects the pitrs in all three worlds'. This mantra is styled "Saptārcis' (having seven flames) in Vāyu 74. 20, Brah mānda 111. 11. 30 and in Viṣṇudharmottara I, 140. 68 and by Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1079 and 1208, who notes that it occurs in seven Puranas. In chap. 206 of the Agni in the procedure of offering arghya to the star Agastya (Canopus) Rg. I 179. 6 has been adopted as verse 13.

Not only are mantras from Vedic Samhitay prescribed by the Purāṇas for certain rites, but Upaniṣad passages also some times with slight variance are bodily transferred into some of the Purāṇas. For example, Kūrma II. 9. 12, 13 and 18 embody Tai. Up. II. 4 (yato vāco nivartante ), Syetāśvataropa, III, 8 (vedāham-etam puruṣam) and VI. 11 eko devaḥ'. The Vigpu purāṇa VI. 5. 65 is 'dve vidye veditavye iti catharyani śrutih' and contains a passage of the Mundaka Up. 1.1.4 (vide note 1461 above). The Vāyu 20.5 (prapavo dhanuḥ) and 20.28 (Ajām ekām) are respectively Mupdakopa. II, 2.4 and Svetāśvatara-up. IV. 5. Vāyu 14. 13 (sarvataḥ pāṇipādāntam) is almost the same as Svetaśyatara Up. III. 16 and Vāmana 47, 64-65 has the same verse. Vamana 47.67 is almost the game as Rg. I. 10.1. 

This gives rise to interesting questions. The sūdras had no right to study the Veda. But as a matter of fact the Purāṇas contain as exemplified above a good many Vedic mantras. It is stated in the Bhāgavata 14682 women, sūdras and brāhmaṇas in name only are beyond the pale of the three Vedas; therefore the sage (Vyāsa) composed through compassion for them the Bharata tale'. The Devibhagavata states 'study of the Voda

But he does not deny to the sūdras the knowledge of the Self altogether. He refers to the instances of Vidura and Dharmavyādha that were possessed of the knowledge of brahma due to the effects of their former lives, states that they would secure the result of brabma jñāna (viz. mokṣa, fipal liberation from samsāra ), that sūdras have the right to learn from the Mahabbārata and Purāṇas as stated in "he should read to the four varṇas' and that in that way they might secure knowledge of brahma and mokṣa, " pat ga: attitainetega rad स्तेषां न शक्यते फलमातिः भतिषेद्धं ज्ञानस्यैकान्तिकफलसात् । 'श्रावयेच्चतुरो वर्णान! इति चेतिहासपुराणाधिगमे चातुर्वर्ण्यस्याधिकारस्मरणात् । वेदपूर्वकस्ख नास्त्यधिकारः बाणामिति Rua Oy on a.

is not accepted for women, tūdras and brahmanas in name only and Puranas are compiled for the purpose of benefitting them'. From this it follows that in the case of gūdras the listening to the Bharata was deemed to bring about the same results that the Veda does for drijas and that even the sūdra may acquire the knowledge of the Self (and mokṣa) from the Bharata. 

Though the brāhmapas in the 5th and following centuries A. D. wanted to placate the sūdras who were probably a majority of the whole people and to wean them away from Buddhism, they still kept a distinction between dvijas and sūdras and the only concessions made wore that the sūdras could worship in the same way as dvijas did and that they could have mantras (Paurāṇika) in their rites and ceremonies. For example, in allowing bhasma-snāna (smoaring ashes on the body ) the Padma (IV. 110. 236-289) provides Vedic mantras for men of the three varṇas but Paurāṇika mantras only (Padma IV. 110. 290-293) for sūdras. The Padma 1469 further provides that sūdras could not perform prāṇāyāma or utter the sacred syllable 'om' but that they should substitute dhyāna in place of prāṇāyāma and 'Śiva' in place of 'om'. 

Gradually in some matters the procedure provided in the Purāpas came to supersede the ancient Vodic procedure pre scribed for them. Aparārka states (on p. 14) that in Devapūjā one should follow the procedure prescribed in the Narasimha purāṇa 1470 and the like and not the procedure of the Pasupatas or Pancarātras and (on p. 15) he says the same about the con secration of temples, 1471 images and the like, 

The Narasimhapurāṇa (chap. 63.5-6) says that the mantra *om namo Nārāyaṇāya' enables one to secure all objects and japa of it frees a man from all sing and leads him to absorption into Viṣṇu.1972

Procedure of ng's coronation in Puranas

The Agnipurāṇa (chap, 818) destribes the procedure of the king's coronation and (chapter 219) sets out the Pauranika mantras (about 70) employed at the coronation. Similarly, the Vigṇudharmottara (II. 21) describes the procedure of coronation with Vedic mantras and (in II. 22 ) with 184 Paurānika Verses invoking various gods, minor deities, sages, rivers &o. Medieval digests like the Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 49–83), Nītimayūkha (pp. 1-4), Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 318-363) describe the combined coronation procedure of Vedic and Paurāpika mantras from the Viṣṇu-dharmottara (vide pp. 78-79 of the H. of Dh, vol. III. for details). The Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 430-433) prescribes numerous mantras derived from the Visaudharmottara as prayers and as blessings. 

The Padmapurāṇa 1473 narrates the interesting story of a person called Dhanaśarmā whose father followed only the Vedic path (śrauta-raārga), who did not engage in such Paurāṇika prescriptions as Vaiśākhasnāna and who therefore became a horrible and distressed preta. Some of the verses are very inter esting. 'I performed in my ignorance only Vedic rites and I never observed Vaisakhasnāna in honour of God Madhava (Vispu), nor observed a single Vaiśākha Full Moon vrata which is like an axe for cutting the tree of sins that afflicts one like a conflagration fed by the fuel of sinful deeds &c.; to one who studies many śāstras and several Vedas with their extensive ancillary Literature, learning does not come, if he has not studied Purāṇas'. This shows what importance came to be attached to Purāṇas not only for sūdras but even for brāhmaṇas who performed the Vedic rites prescribed for them. 

The influence of the Puranas went on increasing gradually. At first it was said 1194 that the dharma understood from the Veda was the highest, while the dharma declared in the Purāṇas

and the like was inferior. This gradually changed and dharma was said to be of three kinds, Vaidika, Tantrika and Mista and it was said in the Bhagavata 1475 and the Padma that one may worship god Vispu in any one of the three ways that one desired. The Padma adds that the Vaidika and Miśraka methods are declared to be proper for brāhmanas and the like, while the Tantrika method of worship is meant for a devotee of Viṣṇu and also for sūdras. The Devibhāgavata (XI. 1.21–23) states that Sruti (Veda) and Smrti are the eyes of dharma and Purāṇa its heart, and that that is dharma which is declared by these three and that dharma oan be found nowhere else than in these, that in Purāpas sometimes what is found in Tantras is put forward &8 dharma, but one should not accept that. 

The Bhaviṣya (Brāhmaparya I, 43-47) in a dialogue between Satānika and Sumantu) first enumerates the 18 dharma-śāstras from Manu to Atri, states that the Vedas, the śāstras of Manu and otbers and the angas are promulgated for the three varpas and not for the benefit of sūdras, that sūdras appear to be very much helpless; how can they be able to secure the four puruṣārthas? They are devoid of agama (traditional loro); what traditional lore was declared for them by the wise among the brāhmaṇas for enabling them to secure the three viz. dharma, artha and kama? Sumantu replies:1176 listen to the Dharma Śāstras that were declared by wise mon for the benefit of all four Varpas and specially for Śūdras viz. the 18 Purāṇas, the life of Rāma of the Raghu race (i. e. the Rāmāyaṇa) and the Bhārata

declared by Parāśara's son (Vyasa); the compassionate Vyasa composed a śāstra for the benefit of all four Varnas in which he comprehended the entire meaning of the Veda and the Dharmen sāstras; it is an unparalleled boat for all that are engulfed in samsāra. This makes it clear that the Purāṇas, the Mahābhā. rata and the Rāmāyaṇa embody pristine traditions and thoughts: and were deemed to have been composed as the instruments of the education and enlightenment of the common people. As & matter of fact we find that some Purāṇas like Agni, Matsya, Viṣṇudharmottara are encyclopaedio and include treatises on politics and government, on law, medicine, astronomy, astro logy, poetry, music, soulpture &o. They illustrate India's life and character as a country and exemplify Bharata's achievements, weaknesses and shortcomings. Two questions that arise are: (1) could the Pusāpas including the Vedic mantras quoted therein be read by the sūdras themselves; (%) supposing that Vedic mantras could not be read by the sūdras, could they, it' they were able to do so, by themselves read the purāṇas without a brāhmana's help. All writers of digests and commentarios were agreed that sūdras could not read or listen to the Vedic mantras contained in the Purāṇas (which being meant for the benefit of all yarpas contained Vedic mantras also), but only those that belonged to the three upper classes. Some writers, however, were agreeable to sūdras reciting Paurāṇika mantras in religious rites, relying on a passage of the Padmapurāṇa. But others like Kamalakarabhatta, author of the Nirnayasindhu and Sūdrakamalakara, held relying on verses of the Bhaviṣya that Paurāṇika mantras alone were to be used by a brāhmaṇa in a, religious rite for a sūdra, that the sūdra was only to listen to the reading of a purāṇa by a brahmana reader. There was a third view held by Sridatta and others that a sūdra could recite a paurāṇika mantra, but he should not himself read the Puranas and should only listen to the reading of Purāṇas by a brāhmane In the times of the Dharmasūtras the only mantras employed were mostly Vedic and therefore in the case of sūdras Gautama 1477 provided that the sūdras were allowed the alter native of saying 'namaḥ' in place of a Vedic mantra. In the centuries preceding Christ the sūdras would naturally have been attracted to Buddha's teaching as it was addressed to all including śūdras. Comparatively early orthodox writers like

Kumārila know that the sūdras formed the largest number of professed Buddhists when he says 1478 'the dicta of Sakya and others were all opposed, except a fow relating to self-restraint, charity and the like, to all the fourteen gources of learning, were promulgated by Buddha and others that bad strayed from the path of the three Vedas and did acts contrary (to the Veda) and that those dicta were presented by them to those who were deluded, who were outside the pale of the three Vedas, who mostly comprised the 4th varṇa (i. e. sudra) and those that had lost caste'. Therefore, the learned brāhmaṇas who wanted to wean sections of the masses (including śūdras) away from Buddhist teachings composed now Paurāṇika mantras by the thousand and employed them in all religious rites like śrāddhas, vratas &c. It was, therefore, that earlier nibandha writers like Śridatta were prepared to allow sūdras to recite Paurāṇika 1479 mantras. But when centuries had elapsed after Buddhism had disappeared from India, orthodox brābmana writers like Kamalakara1180 (who wrote his N. S. in 1612 A.D.) showed a stiffer attitude by confining śūdras merely to the listening to Purāṇas read by a brāhmaṇa and by not allowing them even to recite a Paurāṇika mantra. It may be noted that the Nara simhapurāṇa in laying down the duties of sūdras provides that they should listen to the reading of purāṇas by a brābmapa

Relation of Bruti, Smrti and Purūnas 

(reader) and should worship Narasimha (avatara of Viṣṇu), The relation of Sruti, smrti and Puranas and their spheros of application are summed up in the Naradiyapurāṇa as follows: "The Veda exists in different forms; there is the Veda which has the performance of sacrificial rites (as its sphere); smrtis ara the Veda for the householder's stage; both those are centered in (or supported by) the Puranas. Just as this wonderful world sprang from the ancient Being (God), there is no doubt that all this literature arose from the Purāṇag. I hold that the meaning (or purpose) of the Purāṇas is more extensive (or superior to) than the meaning (or purpose) of the Veda. All the Vedai always rest on the Purāṇas; the Veda is afraid of the man of little learning (with the thought that) that man may harm it. The Veda does not deal with the movements of the planeta, nor does it contain correct calculations about the proper times ( for religious acts), nor does it deal with the tithivrddhi or tithikaya, nor with the determination of the partans (amāvāsya, pūrnima &c.) or eclipses. Determinations about these were formerly made in Itihāsa and Purāṇas. What is not seen in the Vedas is all noticed in the Smstis; what is nog geen in both is declared in the Puranas. What is declared by the Vedas and what is declared by the auxiliary lores -- it is Voda that is declared by Smśtis and Purāpas. The person who looks upon Puranas in any other light would be born as a lower animal', 1481 The Nāradiyapurāṇa 1492 further states 'the merit acquired by those wicked men who speak about Purāṇas as arthavādas (more laudatory 1183 or condemnatory statements) are destroyed and

the wicked man who regards as arthavādas the Puranas that are the means of uprooting ( the evil effects of) all acta, reaches Hell'. 

The Purāṇas introduced several striking changes in the religious rites, practices and ideals of the people. The most characteristic thought and the keynote of the Purāṇas ia to declare how great rewards and results could be secured with little effort. The Viṣṇupurāṇa (VI. 2) narrates how sages approached Vyāga with the question in what age does a little ilharma yield very great rewards'? Vyāsa was bathing in the Ganges; he came out, uttered 'sūdra is good and Kali is good' and then again plunged into the river; then he again came out and said 'well done, O Śūdra! you are blessed'; he again plunged into the river, came out and said 'women are good and blessed; who is more blessed than they'. When he finished his bath and performed his morning rites, the sages asked him to explain what he meant by calling Kali, sūdras and women good and blessed. He replied: 'a man secures in a sipgle day and night in Kali age as much reward of lapus, celibacy and japa as is obtained in ten years in Kr̥ta age, in one year in Tretā and in a month in Dyāpara; therefore, I spoke of Kali as good; in Kali age a man secures merely by the glorification or incessant repetition of the name of Keśava what he would secure by deep meditation in Kṛta, by sacrifices in Tretā, and by worship in Dvāpara; I am pleased with Kali because a man secures great eminence of dharma with a little effort. Persons of the three higher varṇas have to study the Vedas after observing many atrict rules, then they have to perform sacrifices which require wealth; they incur sin if they do not perform their duties properly; they cannot eat and drink as they please, but are dependent on the observance of many rules as to food &o.; dvijas secure higher worlds after great trouble; the sūdra secures his worlds by serving the thres Varnas, he has the right to offer the pākayajñas (without mantras) and therefore he is more blessed than a dvija. He has not to observe strict rules about proper and disallowed food or drink and therefore he wag

declared 'good' by me. A woman by serving her husband in thought, word, and deed secures with legs trouble the same worlds that her husband secures with great effort and trouble and therefore I said a third time about women that they were blessed. The acquistion of dharma is secured with small trouble in Kali age by men who wash off all their sins by the water in the form of the qualities of their soul; sūdras do the same by being intent on service to dvijas and women also secure the Bame without trouble by service to their husbands. Therefore all these three are regarded by me as most blessed. '1984 The Brahmapurana chapter 229 verses 62-80 are identical with Viṣṇu purana VI. 2. 15-30 and 34-36. The Viṣṇupurana emphasizes that each one must do one's duty in the society in which one is born or one's duty which one has undertaken, that, if a person does this, he reaches the game higher worlds, whether he be a brāhmana or a gūdra. This doctrine is the same as taught in the Bhagavadgita 185 18.45 and 46 'a person secures the highest perfection (final emancipation) by being intent on carrying out the duties appropriate to him; man secures perfection (or bllag) by worshipping with the performance of his peculiar duties ( not with flowers and the like or by words) Him from whom all beings proceed and by whom all this (world) is enveloped'. Ancient works like the Vedas, Jaimini's sutras on Mimānsā and the Vedantagutras did not consider or discuss how women or sūdras were to secure higher spiritual life and final Beatitude. The Vedantasutra (I 3. 34-38) denies to the sūdra the right to study the Veda and the Upaniṣads. Buddha's teaching held out the same promise of liberation from suffering

to all men irrespective of class or oaste and was therefore most attractive to sūdras. The Bhagavadgitā and the Puranas changed the whole outlook of Indian society, high or low, and promised the same higher spiritual life or worlds to all who dia their work under a senge of social duty, did not hanker after mundane rewards and brought all their actions, in whatever avocation they might be ongaged, as an offering to God. In the Padmapurāpa 1486 Vyāsa is made to say to Yudhisthira: "It is not possible to observe in the Kali age the rules of Dharma laid down by Manu and by the Vedas; the one thing which one should do is to observe a fast on Ekādaśī in both fortnights (of a month ), which is an easy means (that) requires little wealth, that entails little trouble, but yields great rewards, that is the very essence (of the teachings) of all Purāṇas; he should be pure and on Dyādaśī after worshipping Keśava with flowers be should first feed brāhmanas and then himself take his meal; those who desire to secure heaven should perform this vrata throughout their lives; even persons of evil conduct, the greatest sinners devoid of dharma, do not go to Yama ( do not fall into hell) if they fast on Ekādasi." The Sūtasarhitā states 'effort for acquiring true knowledge (of the Self) is meant for all (for persons even lower than śūdras), that effort made by explaining in a different language (than Sanskrit) and by the lapse of enough time will tend to the good ( of the lowest). This clearly shows how the Purāṇas put before all people easy ways whereby they could attain bliss in the Hereafter, 

The Baud.1487 Dh. S., Manu and Vasistha emphasize that one should not invite a large company of brāhmaṇas at a srāddha, because a large company destroys these five (advan tages) viz. showing proper respect to invitees, propriety of place and time, cleanliness and the securing of worthy brāhmaṇas and

It was further provided by the Anusagana-parva 1488 and others that one should not go deep into examining the learning, family and character of brāhmaṇas in a rite for the gods, but in rites for the Manog close examination as to these matters is proper (or justified). The Purāṇas went against both those prescrip tions. They are not tired of recommending again and again profuse expense in grāddhas and condemaning stinginess (lit. roguishness in spending money) in śrāddhas and also in such other matters as the observances of Ekādasi. For example, the Viṣṇupurāṇa 1989 quotes nine verses (III. 14. 22-30) as uttered by the pitrs, two of which may be translated here 'Would that & wise and blessed person be born in our family who not indulg ing in stinginess in spending wealth will offer pindas to us and who would donate to brāhmanas for our sake jewels, clothes, a large conveyance, wealth and all enjoyments if he has riches'! Padma 1490 recommends that avoiding stinginoss brings pleasure to the pitys. The Matsya (56. 11) prescribes that one should not show stinginess in the Kļspāstamivrata. The Padma says that that bad man who being possessed of wealth celebrates the jāgara on Ekādaśī in a close-fisted way loses his soul. The Brahmapurāṇa 1491 says in a general way that whoever does a religious act with stinginess is a sinner. 

Manu (III. 149) provides that 'in rites in honour of gods one who knows dharma should not oritically examine the brāhmapas to be invited for dinner, but in a rite for ancestors one should carefully investigate the fitness of) brāhmadas'. This does not mean that in rites for gods any one may be invited. We have to observe the general rule of Manu (II. 128) that donors should give only to a man who has studied the Veda

dinger in rites for gods or pitra. So what Manu III. 149 means is that deep investigation of ancestry &o, is not necessary in rites for gods, 

It is provided by the Vayu 1492 that there is to be no exami. nation of the qualities and character of the brāhmaṇas at Gayā, and the Varāhapurāṇa provides that all brāhmanas of Mathurā are like gods and that a brāhmana of Mathurā not knowing even a k verse is superior to a brāhmaṇa of another place that has atudied the four Vedas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 579, 670 for details of Gaya and Mathurā brāhmanas. The Padmapurāṇa and the Skands (Kāśikhanda 6.56-57 ) recommend that at tirthas (Sacred places) one should not engage in investigation of the worth) of brāhmapas, and that Manu declares that brāhmanas appearing (at a tirtha) and desiring food should be fed. 1993 

It is not unlikely that the above passages from the Vayu, Varāba and Padma are later interpolations. When Buddhism was flourishing large companies of Buddhist monks were fod by the people. When Buddhism declined and disappeared from India after the 12th or 13th century A. D. people came to believe that there was great merit in feeding poor brāhmaṇas just as in former times people fed monks and the Puranas might have only echoed and emphasized the general sentiments of the people. If the people in general had not come to believe in this, the author feels that no amount of interpolations or insistence by the so called crafty brāhmaṇas would have been effective, Writers, Western or Indian, that, relying on the notions current in the 19th and 20th centuries, pass severe and unmeasured strictures on the provisions for brāhmaṇas in the Purāṇas do great injustice to the authors of Purāṇas that flourished about a thousand years ago or more. Such writers should compare Indian medieval conditions, ideas and doings of brahmanas with the claims of the Popes, Christian priests, Inquisitions and the state of monastic Orders in Europe from about the 10th century A. D. to the 15th century. In comparison it would be

As a consequence of the abovementioned dominating prinoiple the Purāṇas strongly recommend dāna ( gifts, parti oularly of food), pilgrimages and baths in sacred waters, vratas, ahimsa, bhakti, repetition of the name of god, srāddhas &o. These will be briefly illustrated below, 

The Purāṇas institute a comparison between solemn Vedic Haorifices on the one hand and pilgrimages and baths at sacred places on the other. The Vanaparva 1495 contrasts the two 29 follows, " the solemn saorificos promulgated by the sages cannot be accomplished by a poor man; sacrifices require many imple. ments and a collection of various materials, which are secured by kings or sometimes by rich men, but not by poor men who have to rely on themselves alone, who have no helpers and who do not possess means. Going to holy places conters merit and Burpasses sacrifices. One does not secure that reward by such sacrifices as Agniṣtoma, in which profuse fees are distributed, which is secured by repairing to sacred places. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 561–564 for further encomiums of sacred places and the virtues to be cultivated for reaping the full merit of pilgrimages,

parva 14% (127. 5-6 ) remarks that fasts are equal to sacrifices in the matter of rewards. They are put forward as superior to sacrifices in Padma.1497 It says: Viṣṇuvrata is super-eminent; a hundred Vedic sacrifices are not equal to it; by performing a Bacrifice one may go to heaven, but one who observes the Kārti kavrata goes to Vaikuntha (the world of Viṣṇu). For the exaggerated importance attached to fasts and vratas, vide pp. 43-45 above. 

First dāna. High eulogies of gifts have been sung from the Rgveda downwards. The subject of dāna (gifts) in all its aspects has been dealt with in the H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 837-888, The Mahābhārata in numerous places (particularly in the whole of Anuśāsana-parva) and the Purāṇas such as Matsya chap. 82 92 and 274–289, Agni chap. 208–213, Varāha 99-111, Padma V. 21. 81-213 (which agree almost verbatim with Matsya 83-92), Padma II, 39-40 and 94, III, 24, Kūrma II. 26 devote a great deal of space to the subject of dānns. But here only two topics in relation to gifts will be dealt with, viz. .gifts of food and gifts to brāhmaṇas. The Rgveda condemns the person as merely a sinful one who does not offer food to the gods nor to his friends and uses it only to fill his own belly, 1199 The Ait. Br. and the Tai.1999 Br, speak of food' asprāna'(life). The Baud. 1500 Dh. S. states" all beings depend on food, the Veda says 'food is life,' therefore food should be given to others), food is the highest offering". Manu 1501 and Viṣṇu Dh. S. state the man who cooks food only for his own sake (and not for offering to gods and mon) eats merely sin'. The Bhagavadgitā carries the same message those who eat food loft after offering in sacrifice are frood from all sids, but those who cook food for their sake alone eat sin'. The Padma has a fine passage 'those who always feed the cripple, the blind, children, old men, persons that are dis

ogsed, helpless and pinched by penury, always enjoy bliss in heaven; there is no end to the merit (accumulated) by con structing wells and tanks, where aquatio animals and others moving on land drink water when they desire, for water is the life of living beings and life is centred in water. The distribu tion of food particularly to learned brāhmaṇas is highly praised in Brahma-parāpa 1502 218. 10-32, Padma V. 19. 289-307m, agai 211. 44-46. The gift of food is superior to all gifts; food is the Tife of men, from food spring all beings; the worlds are depen dent on food, therefore food is praised; man secures heaven by the gift of food; a person who joyfully gives food acquired by just means to brāhmaṇas deeply learned in the Veda ia released from all sids' says Brahma. The Agnipurāṇa says "The gifts of elephants, horses, chariots, male and female slaves and houses do not come up even to a sixteenth part of the gift of food (in merit); a person who committing & great sin afterwards distributes food becomes free from all sins and secures everlast ing worlds' (211. 44-46). The Kūrma 1503 prescribes a man should give to a brahmavārin (Vedic student) food every day (i. e. when he comes begging); thereby he becomes free from all sins and reaches the abode of Brahma'. Similarly, Padma oalls upon house-holders to give as much cooked food to ascetics as would fill the begging bowl From very ancient times a house holder was called upon to perform five Yajñas ( sacrifices) daily, two of which were Balıharana and honouring a guest (Mazu III, 70) and he was to place food on the ground for persons who had lost caste, who suffered from loathsome diseases, to dāṇdālas, dogs, crows and even insects 1504 (Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 9.5, Mam III. 92). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 745-747 on Vaiśvadoya and Baliharana. Underlying these provisions was the noble senti ment of universal kindliness and charity, the persistent ides that, in spite of social gradations, rules and prejudices dividing

men from each other, one Supreme Light poryades and illumi. nates the meanest of creatures and makes the whole world kin. This spirit of a householder to regard it as his duty to offor food to all needy persons and particularly to poor and deserving students and brāhmaṇas has prevailed almost to the present day, though during the last few years shortage of food, high prices and rationing have undermined it a great deal. 

Then as to gifts to brāhmanas. In the first place, it must be remembered that all brāhmapas were not priests and are not priests in modern timos. Similarly, all priests in all Indian temples and shrines are not brāhmaṇas. Temple priests are comparatively a later institution and in olden times they were looked down upon and are regarded as inferior brāhmaṇas oven in modern times. Manu (III. 152) states that a devalaka (a brāhmaṇa who performed for remuneration service before the image in a temple) was unfit to be invited at a śrāddha or to officiate in a sacrifice to gods, if he continuously served for three years in that capacity. The ideal set before brāhmaṇas from Yery ancient times was of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of abandoning the active pursuit of riches, of devotion to the study of the Veda and śāstras, of cherishing a high culture and of handing down literature and cultural outlook. Smrtis like Yāj. I, 213 recommend that even if a brābmaṇa be fit for receiving a religious gift he should refuse gifts and thereby he-secures the same worlds that habitual donors secure. It was for preserving such high ideals among brāhmaṇas that Yaj. I. 333 prescribes that a king should make gifts of cows, gold and land and should bestow on learned brāhmaṇas houses and requisites for marriage (maidens, expenses of marriages &c.). Vide H. of Dh. VOL. II. Pp. 856-858 where references are given to inscriptions containing donations to brābmanas of houses and marriage expenses. In these days every body talks of the high culture and literary traditions of ancient India. But who cultivated the vast Vedic and other Sanskrit literature, presoryad it and propagated it for several millenia? The answer would have to be that it was mostly due to some of the brahınanas who stuck to the ancient ideal for thousands of years. If the Rgveda can be put forward in these days as the most ancient of the literary monuments in any Aryan language, who preserved its more than ten thousand verses with unparallelled care by oral transmission without hardly any variant readings. The reply will again have to be that the brābmanas did it by a 

Self-denial by many brahmanas 

937 

self-denying ordinance. The Brābmanas had to study the Veda with auxiliary lores without 1505 an eye to any ulterior motive, but simply as a duty and to understand the meaning thereof, they were to teach the Veda and other lores without demanding beforehand a fee, they had to bring up their own families, per form sacrifices and make gifts themselves. The only substantial Bources of income were officiating at sacrifices and religious rites and receiving gifts. These sources must always have been variable, fitful and precarious. The brāhmaṇas had no power to tax people as in the case of tithes in the West. Nor had they a regularly paid hierarchy of deacons, priests, bishops and archbishops as in the Anglican Church Therefore, the brahmanas are advised to approach the king or a rich person for their livelihood (vide Gautama IX.63 'Yogakṣemārtham-Isvaram adhigaccet). It should be noted that before Buddhism spread far and wide the sūtras and smstis emphasized that religious gifts should be made only to a worthy brāhmana, learned and well-conducted. For example, Āpastamba 1506 prescribes 'one should invite for dinner in all religious acts brāhmaṇas that are pure, that have studied the Veda and that one should distribute gifts at a proper time and place, ori occasions of purificatory rites and when there is a worthy recipient.' To the same effect are Vas. Dh. S. III. 8, VI. 30, Manu (III. 128, 132, IV, 31), Yaj. (1. 201), Daksa (IL. 26 and 31). Not every brāhmaṇa was in those ancient times a proper recipient for a gift, but he had to possess qualities of what is called 'pātra'. A few definitions of pātra may with advantage be cited here. The Anugāgar parva 1507 has a long passage emphasizing the qualities of deserving brāhmaṇa : 'gifts made to good brāhmaṇas that are free from anger, that are intent on dharma, are devoted to truth and self

control yield great rewards; the sages regard that brahmana as pātra who studies the four Vedas with their argas (auxiliary lores like phonetics, grammar &o.), who is active in doing six acts (viz, abstaining from wine and meat, observing the bounds of morality, purity, study of the Veda, sacrifices, making gifts). Even a single eminent brāhmaṇa endowed with intellect, Vedic learning, good conduot and character saves the whole family; one should bring from afar a brāhmaṇa on hearing that he is possessed of good qualities and is approved by good men and should welcome him and honour him in all ways'. Yaj. furni shes 1506 a brief but striking definition of a worthy brāhmaṇa not by Vedic learning alone nor by tapas (austere life) alone worthiness arises; that person is declared to be pātra (worthy recipient for a religious gift) where both these (i. e. Vedic learning and tapas) and good conduct exist. Manu provides that religious gifts given to a brāhmaṇa who has not studied the Veda or who is avaricious or deceitful are fruitlegs and lead the donor to hell (IV. 192-194). The Bhagavadgitā also (17.22) condemns & gift given to an unworthy person as tāmasa ( affected by tamas, arising from ignorance or delusion). 

As Buddhism grow in popularity and secured algo royal support, the brāhmaṇas had to tackle several tasks. They had to keep the number of brāhmaṇas at a high level, they had to find maintenance for those devoted to the deep study of the Veda and they had to make accommodation with provalent Buddhist thoughts by assimilating as many of them as possible in their owa writings. Every brāhmaṇa could not possess the memory, the intelligence and the persistent endeavour for long years required for memorizing and mastering even his own Voda and its subsidiary Literature. If one bundred brāhmaṇa families were patronized, hardly ten percent of them could have been masters of their own Veda, but there was always the possibility that those who were not themselves good Vedic scholars might have sons, some of whom might turn out to be profound students of the Voda. Therefore, the number of brāhmapas was to be increased and they had to be fed and not to be allowed to fritter away energy and time in working for their bread. It is mainly due to these factors that some of the Purīnas contain incassant end frantic appeals for gifts to brahmanas,

At the time when most of the Purāṇas were composed, the brāhmaṇas were hemmed in by great dificulties and hostile forces. From about the 3rd century B.O. to the 7th century A. D. Buddhism enjoyed royal patronage under such great kings as Asoka, Kaniska and Harga. Buddhism was not really a revolt against caste, but against the sacrificial system, against the Veda and its authority to show the way to salvation, Buddha did not found a new religion, but he was a great re former of Hinduism. He laid sole stress on moral effort, ahinsa, satya &c. which had already been integrated into Hinduism and were part of it and which continue to this day to be part of Hinduism. Buddha in his first sermon in the deer-park near Banaras preached that one who renounced the world should shun two extremes 1509 viz. the pursuit of pleasures and the practice of useless austerities, that it is the course discovered by him that led to wisdom and nirvāna. He expounded the four noble Axioms or Truths (Aryasatyāni) viz. suffering ( duḥkha), the cause of suffering 1510 viz. tanha i.e. traṇā (duḥkha-samudaya), the suppression of suffering ( duḥkha-nirodha), and the way that leads to the suppression of suffering (duḥkha-nirodhagamini patipada). This last is the Noble Eight-fold path (agtangiko 1514

History of Dharmatõstra (Seo. V, C., XXIV mārgaḥ) viz. right views, right thoughts or aspirations, right speech, right actions, right living, right exertion, right recollec tion (or mindfulness), right meditation (i.e. briefly leading a virtuous life). These doctrines preached to all by the noble Buddha and his disciples were attractive as remarked by Rhys Davida, 1511 particularly to the śūdras whose social position was low in the Vedic times and also in the days of the smṛtis. No one could study the Veda in the presence of a śūdra, a sūdra could not parform sacrifices and had to serve the three higher varṇas in very ancient times. Almost the same position was assigned to him by Manu (VIII. 413) viz. that he was created by God for serving the brāhmana, though it is doubtful whether this could be or was enforced. Vide H. of Dn. vol. II, pp. 33-36 and pp. 154-164 for the position and disabilities of śūdras from the Vedic times up to the days of the Smortis. It should not, however, be supposed that all India had become Buddhist. Millions still remained Hindus. There was the danger and fear that with royal patron age and the attractive features of Buddha's teachings large masses might forsake their ancient faith. 

The brāhmaṇas of the times when Buddhism was at its peak had to strive to keep the banner of the Vedic religion flying, to deprive Buddhism of its bold on the masses of the people and even on the intelligentsia and to make them stick to the old fold. Buddhism itself had changed a great deal in its ideals, dootrinos sometime before the beginning of the Christian era and for centuries thereafter. Buddha's original doctrines were aimed at individual effort and salvation of the individual by his own effort and self-culture. Early Buddhist texts deny the existence of anything like a soul 1512 and find no place for 

1511. Vide his eloquent Intro to S. B. E, vol. XI. p. 142 Never in the history of the world had a scheme of salvation beco pat forth 60 simple in its datore, so free from any superhuman agency, so independent of, 80 even antagonistic to the belief in a soul, tbe belief in God, the hope for a future life. Buddba pat forth deliberately the doctrine of a galva. tion to be found here in this life in a laward change of beart to be brought about by perseverance in a mere system of self.culture and of self control.

the idea of God. Though Buddha spoke of Nirvana he did not clearly define it nor does he specify the condition of the indivi dual when he enters nirvāṇa. Aśvaghoṣa compares nirvana to the extinction of a flame (Saundarananda, chap. XVI, 28-29). Bocanse the doctrine of karma was deeply rooted in the popular mind at the time of Buddha, Buddhism took over that dootrine, which, to men who are not Buddhists, appears to be contradio tory of the denial of the existence of a soul. The word 'Dhamma' is used in three senses in the Pāli Dhammapada' (which being mentioned in the questions of Milinda is earlier than the 2nd century B. C.) viz. (1) the truth or law preached by Buddha, (2) thing or form, (3) way or mode of life. 

As stated above, the original Buddhism preached by the Buddha and his followers in the first century or two after his parinirvana was more or less a strict ethical code for individuals who sought salvation from the misery of the world. The three central conceptions of very early Buddhism wore the three refuges (or rainas ) Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Gradually a new doctrine was evolved.1513 It came to be thought that to care for one's own deliverance and spend all efforts thereon was rather selfish, that as the Buddha himself out of compassion for suffering humanity worked for forty-five years to lead men to salvation by his exhortations and sermons, so a Buddhist should prefer tor put off his own deliverance, should work for the deliverance of his fellowmen out of compassion (karuna) for their miserable lot and in doing so should be ready to be born again and again, should not care for his own salvation and should not be afraid of satnsāra. Those holding these latter views deified Buddha, taught that Buddhahood was attained by Siddhārtha after under going numerous births in doing service and rendering help to others and that this was a superior code of conduct (Mahāyāna, the Great Vehicle or Way) to the selfish code of salvation for an individual himself ( which came to be called Hinayāna, the leggor Vehicle or Way). This extra-regarding gospel of Mahāyāna was very attractive and won great support in most countries of Asia, 151,

This dootrine of Bodhisattves (meaning 'beings destined to be enlightened') is not consistent with the gospel of Buddha as proached by him in his first sermon at Banaras. There is a difference of ideals between Hinayāna and Mahāyāna The original gospel relies on self-effort and moral regeneration and on the elimination of suffering and misery by the extinction of all passions and of hankerings or desires and of the desire of

R, Ambedkar (1957) in which he refrains from considering Buddhist Texts except those in Pali; 'Comparative study of Buddhism and Christianity, by Prof, F. Masutan! (Tokyo, 1957). The Mabāyāna-sūtrālankāra of Asanga (ed. by Prof. S. Levi) sommarises la two verses (I. 9-10) the points (five) on which the two schools are in conflict. It-sing's Records of the Buddhist religion translated by Dr. J. Takakasa (Oxford, 1896) surprisingly enough states (p. 15) 'These two systems are perfectly accord with the noble doctrine, Both equally conform to truth and lead us to Nirvana', Baddha at least ignored (if he did not positively deny) God, be denied the individual soul and Eternity, be did not emphasize the most vital Upa nigad teaching viz. ' anando brabmeti vyajāgāt'. He imagined salvation as & state of absolate quiescence and therefore regarded ordinary life as misery and asserted that salvation may be attained even in this very life. He did not claim to be God, but a buman being. There are various kinds of Mahāyāna doctrines and great diversity of definitions. It may generally be said that works professing to teach Mahāyāaa practically forsake the ideal of a human Buddha, preach the worsbip of Buddha and fatore Buddhas, and assert that Nirvana cannot be attained by the ancient method, that salvation cannot come in this very life but after centuries and acons of the practice of virtas and helping others. 

Mantrayāna and Vajrayana are said by some to be branches of Maba gina, about the latter of which a good deal will be said in the next section. According to Bhikṣu Rabula Sāṅktyāyada, Vajrayana ( 700-1200 A.D. ) is 2 synonym of Mabāyāna (400–700 A. D.) and werely the ulterior dopalope ment of it (vide p. 211 of the paper ‘L' Origine du Vajrayina ot Laa 84 Siddhar' io J. A. vol. 225 (1934) pp. 209-230.

life 1515 itself. Buddha's original teaching regarded it ag & Waste of time to ponder over such questions as 'Have I existed during the ages that are past or have I not? Shall I exist during the ages of the future? Do I after all exist or am I not?' The Sabbāgavasutta (9-13) says that a wise man walking in the noble eightfold path understands what things ought to be con sidered and what things ought not to be considered. Vide 8.B.E. VOL XI, pp. 298-300. Buddhism brought half of Asia under ito influence not only by its promise of salvation to all by self-help, but more so by its teachings of profound tenderness, of active charity, of goodness and gentlenesa. Mahāyāna laid great stress on doing good to all and on bhakti. Both the original teaching of Hinayāna and the Mabāyāna teaching are attractive in their own way. 

Buddhism insisted on the five silas 1516 that were binding on all Buddhists viz. prohibition of injury to and destruotion of life, of theft, of sexual impurity, of lying and of intoxioating liquors. Five more precepts ( which together with the preceding five were called Daśaśiksāpadas) were added for Buddhist priests, viz. prohibition of eating at forbidden hours, of attending wordly amusements such as dancing, song, music and shows, of the use of unguents and ornaments, of the use of a large or ornamented couch and of the receiving of gold and silver. About the silas it is clear that they were adopted from the ancient Upaniṣadio and Dharmasūtra teachings. The Chandogya narrates how Aśvapati, king of Kekaya, boasted before five great householders and theologiang'in my 1517 kingdom there ia no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without a firs-altar in his house, Do ignorant person, no adulterer, much less an adulteress'. The same Upaniṣad 1518 quotes an ancient verse a man who steals gold, who drinks liquor, who dishonours his guru's bed, who kills & brahmapathese four fall and a fifth also that associates with any one of those four.' It will be shown 

1515. That destraction of desires is nirvana is stated in Ratanaautta 14 and the similo mentioned is that of a lamp being extinguished (by lack of oli).

a little later how ahingā wag emphasized even in the Upaniṣads. Thus ahimsa, non-stealing, sexual purity, truthfulness had already been emphasized in the oldest Upanisads. That an agoetic 1519 had to give up all property and beg for keeping body and soul together is made clear by Br. Up. III. 5.1 and IV.4.22, Jabalopanisad 5. Gautama III. 10-13, Vasistha x. The other five precepts for priests such as not receiving gold or silver or giving up unguents, flowers, dancing, singing and music are laid down by Gautama 1520 II. 19 and III. 4, Vasisthax.6&c. for Vedic students and ascetics. Vide H. Kern (in 'Manual of Indian Buddhism, Grundriss p. 70) who remarks that the superior morality for monks is nothing else but the rule of life for the dirija in the 4th ūśrama, when he is a yati and all the details were taken from the Dharma-sūtras and Dharmaśāstras, 

Ahimsā -- The Mahābhārata and the Puranas lay great emphasis on abiinsā (not harming or giving pain to a living creature). The Upanisads too emphasized ahimsā. The Chandogya 1521 does so in several passages. In III. 17.4 it says 'tapas, charity, straight-forwardness, ahimsa, speaking the truth-these are the fees of this (sacrifice without ceremonial)'. While describing how the person who has attained true know ledge of the Self does not return ( to this sainsāra), the Chandogya says that he causes no pain to any creature except at tirthas'. The Br. Up. (V.2.) says how Prajapati told the gods, the asuras and men that the sound 'da da da' produced by thundering

clouds conveys to the gods the necessity of self-restraint ( dama), to theasures of compassion (daya) and to men of charity (dana). Gautama 1522 specifies eight virtues of the soul, the first of which is compassion for all beings and states that he who has the forty saīskāras performed on him but does not possong the eight virtues does not secure absorption into brahman The Adiparya provides abimsā is the highest dharma for all beings; therefore a brahmana should never harm (or give pain to ) any being'. The words 'ahirsā paramo dharmaḥ' (ahimsā is the highest dharma) ocour very frequently in the Mahābhārata 1523 (e. g. in Dropaparva 192. 38, Santi 265.6, 339. 18, Anusasana 115,25, 116. 38, Aivamedhikaparva 28. 16-18, 43. 21). Santiparva (296.22-24) enumerates thirteen virtues common to all men, of which freedom from cruelty and ahirsa are the first two. Vasistha IV.4, Manu x. 63, Yaj. I. 122 prescribe certain virtues as necessary in men of all varṇas. Vide . of Dh. vol. II. p. 10 notes 25-27. 

A few examples of emphasis on ahimsā in the Puranas may be cited here. The Vamanapurana1534 provides : ahinsa, truth

fulness, absence of stealing, charity, forbearance, self-oontrol, quiescence of senses, absence of poor spirit or weakness, purity, tapas-this is the tenfold dharma spplicable to all varṇas. The Padma says : Dot by (the study of ) the Vedas, nor by gifte nor by tapas, nor by sacrifices do men who kill creatures reach the goal of heaven; ahimsa is the highest dharma, the highest tapas and the highest charity--this is what the søges always say; mon that are compassionate treat fios, reptiles, stinging insects, lice and the like and human beings as themselves, Matsya goes so far as to state ; great sages do not commend sacrifios in which there is killing; by donating grains of corn gathered in a field, roots, fruits, vegetables, vessel for carrying water according to their ability, sages practising austorities became established in heaven; absence of hatred and greed, self-restraint, compassion towards all beings, control of senses, celibacy, tapas, tenderness, farbearance and firmness—this is the root of the ancient dharua, which is difficult to accomplish. The Brahmānda (II. 31. 35 

tagmād-ahimsa dharmasya dvāram-uktam maharṣibhiḥ' ) says that great sages have declared that ahimsā is the door of dharma. The Padma (V. 43. 38 ) says there is no dāna nor tapas equal to ahimsā'. It is interesting to note that the Mateya and Brabmāṇda regard ahimsā as 'sanātana dharma' and condemn animal sacrifices. The Kurma 1525 provides 'ahirai, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possession of wealth these are briefly declared yamas that produce purity of mind among mon, The great sagos deolare that ahinsa consists in cansing no pain to all boings at all times by thought, word or

dood. There is no dharma superior to ahimah, no happiness higher than the praotice of ) ahimsā; the injury (to life ) that ia caused socording to (Vedic) pracepts is declared to be ahirnar.' The Upaniṣads commended a qualified abimsi, while the original Pali books like the Sāmāñña-phala-gutta forbad injury to all living beings. Most of the Puranas, in order to convince the masses that they did not lag behind the Buddhist preachings, generally insist upon unqualified ahimsa. Time brings about strange changes. Professing Buddhists in Ceylon, China, Japan and many other countries have no objection to partaking of fish and meat, while following the insistent advice of the Purinas, millions of Indian people (not only brāhmaṇas but also others like vaisyas and sūdras if Vaiṣṇavas) have been striot vege tarians for centuries, though Buddhism vanished from India centuries ago. 

It may be noted, however, that some of the Puranas are against varrying the doctrine of ahimsa to extremes. The Brahmapda and Vayu both say that there is no sin, great or small, in killing a person (e. g. a tyrant or a desperado ), when many will live in happiness by his death, 1526 

Parta-The Purāṇas lay the greatest emphasis on what is called purtadharma, works of public utility, charity, soola! service and the relief of the poor and distressed. The word Istāpūrta occurs in the Rgveda once 159 May you be united in the highest heaven with your pitys ( ancestors), with Yams and with iṣtāpārta'( merit acquired by sacrifices and works of public utility ). The word ista occurs several times in Rg. (I. 162, 16 1. 164. 15, X. 11. %, X82.2), but the meaning is not certain except in Rg. X. 11. 2 where it appears to mean sacrifice'. Purta also occurs in Rg. VI. 16. 18 and VIII, 46. 21, but the meaning is not certain. "Iṣtāpūrta' occurs in several Upanigades

The Chandogya states 1528 But they who, living in a village, practise ( a life of ) sacrifions, works of public utility and alms giving reach toward smoke &c.'. Similarly, the Praśna-upaniṣad Aggerts 'those, who practise the (mode of) sacrifices and works of publio utility as aotivities to be engaged in, reach only the world of the Moon, and it is these that again return to this world'. The Mundaka says 'deluded people regarding sacrifices and works of public utility as the best do not know ( recognize) any other higher good; having enjoyed ( their reward) on the top of heaven, they again enter this world or even a lower one'. 1529 Manu speaks of 'iṣta' and 'pūrta' and recommends that one should always practise with a pleased heart sacrificial gifts and gifts of the pūrta kind according to one's ability on securing a deserving brābmapa. The Amarakośa defines "iṣta' as sacrifices and pārta' as works such as digging a well or tank. The Mārkandeya 1530 defines them as follows 'Maintaining the sacred firos, tapas, truthfulness, study. of the Voda, hogpitality and Vaiśvadova-these are called ista; digging wells and tanks and building temples and distribution of food to those that need it these are declared to be purta. The Agnipurāṇa has similar vorses. The Padma (VI. 243. 10–14) cites the following as dharmakarya (religious works); temples of Viṣṇu and Śiva, tanks, wells, lotus ponds, forest of vata, pippala, mango, kakkola, jambu and nimba trees, flower garden, distribution of food from mording to Sunset, water distribution outside towns &o. The Skanda 1531 says: the term 'pūrta' is applied in the charma sūstras to the erection of temples, construction of tanks, ponds and wells, laying out parks. Padma (VI, 244, 34-35 ) says that those who build monasteries, cow stables, houses of rest on roads,

Sometimes the Purāṇas express ideas that might strike us as rather modern, when they put forward social service and removal of suffering and distress as the highest dharma. In the Mārkandeya 1534 a king solemnly states 'men do not obtain that happiness in heaven or in the world of Brahma, which springe from giving relief to distressed beings. Sacrifices, gifts, tapas do not conduce to the relief here and in the next world of that man whose heart is not set on relieving the distressed'. The Viṣṇu recommends & wise man should say (and do ) that alone by thought, word and deed which would be for the benefit of creatures here and hereafter'. The Skanda-purana (Kasikhanda) aver 'adversities of those good men in whose heart doing good to others is awake (i.e.aotive) vanish and prosperity comes to them at every step.

others. The Brahma states the life of the man who always strives for the good of others is fruitful (blessed); fire, water, the Sun, the earth and various kinds of crops exist for the benefit of others, and particularly the good ( exist for others' benefit). 

It is surprising that the Bhagavata avers what is in advance of modern socialistio doctrines 'men have ownership over only that much as would fill their belly; he who thinks as his own what is more than that is a thief and deserves punishment (As such). 15:35 

Bhaldi-The Puranas lay very great emphasis on bhakti (religion of loving faith in God). This is not the place to dilate on the history of the cult of Bhakti from the earliest times to modern days. For that purpose there are special treatises ( some of which are noted below) that may be consulted. But a few words on bhakti in general may be said here before going into the ques tion as to what the Puranas have to say thereon. Traces of the doctrine of bhakti may be discovered even in the Rgvedio hymns and mantras, some of which are full of loving faith in God, particularly in some of the hymns and vorges addressed to Varuna and also to Indra. A few examples may be cited. All my thoughts 1536 (or hymns) praise Indra in unison, seeking light, longing for him, as wivos embrace their husband, their fat young lover, they (thoughts) embrace him (Indra), the divine giver of gifts'; 'your friendship 1537 (with your devotee) is indestructible ( everlasting); to him who desires a cow, you become a cow, to him who longs for a horse, may you be a horso;" 'O Indra, you are far better (or richer) than my father or my brother who does not feed me; (you) and my mother, O Vasu, are equal and protect (me) for (conferring) riches and favoura'; "You gave to Kaksivat, who offered a hymn and Soma libation to you and who had grown old, Vrcaya, who was a young

woman; you became the wife of Vrsañaśva; all these (tavours) of yours deserve to be loudly proclaimed during the offerings of soma libations'; 'you who, shining brilliantly, come to each house assuming the form of a small man, ( Indral) drink this Soma juice (produced) by being crushed with my teeth and mixed with fried grains, gruel, cake and laud'. Comparo Rs. III. 43. 4, X 42. 11, X. 112. 10 (in all of which Indra is called 'sakhā' friend ) and I. 104.9, VII, 32.26 (in both Indra is said to be like a father). It will be clear from these passages that the Vedic seges had reached the stage of sakhya-bhakti, that the sages believed that Indra was like a mother, that he assumed the form of a wife for the sake of a devotee, that Indra partook soma juice from a devotee who, in the absence of the proper imple ments for crushing soma stalks, extracted soma juice from soma stalks crushed with the devotee's own teeth, These stories in the far-off ages of the Rgveda remind us of the stories in the works of the medieval ages about Rama having accepted badars fruit from a Sabari (Bhil woman) devotee who first tasted them with her teeth to see whether they were sweat or sour and the story of the God Vithobā of Pandharpur, having assumed the form of & mahar (an untouchable) and paid up to the Moslom king of Bijapur the money equivalent to the price of corn which, Damaji (a great devotee), who was in charge of the royal granary, allowed people distressed by famine to take away. Some mantras addressed to Varuṇa show the same kind of sakhya-bhakti. Vasiṣtha 1537a prays 'O Varupa I what is that great offence foom mitted by me) on account of which you desire to harm me, your friend and bard; declare that to me, O invincible and self-willed God, so that ( after propitiating you) I shall be free from sin and may be able quickly to approach you with adoration '; 'whare are those friendships of ours (of you and me) which we safely enjoyed in former times, O self-willed Varuṇa?;I (then) went to your big dwelling house that has a thousand doors; whatever offence we mortals commit against the divine hosta, O Varuna, whatever laws of yours we may have violated in our ignorance (or heedlessness ), do not, O God, harm us on 80count of that sin'. It is remarkable that in the Rgveda thors is a verse in which

there is an apotheosia 1538 of .namas' (namaskāra, adoration or homage );'Adoration itself is mighty, I offer service with adora tion; adoration upholds the heaven and the earth; adoration to the gods, adoration rules these gods, whatever sin is committed ( by me) I worship it away with adoration'. 

Though the word 'bhakti' does not occur in the principal ancient Upaniṣads, the doctrine of the bhakti schools that it is God's grace alone that saves the devotee is found in the Katha and Mundaka Upanisads, viz. 'this Supreme Soul is not to be attained by expositions (of a teacher) nor by intelligence, nor by much learning; He is to be attained by him alone whom the Supreme Soul favours, to him this Supreme Soul discloses His form. "1589 This emphasizes the doctrine that God's Grace alone brings balvation to the devotee, The Svetāśvataropaniṣad employs the word bhakti in the same sense in which it is used in the Gita and 1640 other works on bhakti. These matters declared ( here) roveal themselves to that high-souled person who has the highest faith in God and the same faith in his guru as in God'. The sane Upanisad emphasizes & doctrine of the bhakti school in *I, desirous of moksa (liberation from samsāra ), surrender myself as my refuge to that God who in former times created (established) Brahmā, who transmitted to him (Brahma ) the Vedas, and who illuminates the intellect of the individual soul', 

The word prapadye' in the Svetāóvatara serves as the basis of the doctrine of prapatti' in the Vaiṣṇavite system such as that of Rāmānuja. 

But among the original sources of the Bhakti cult are the Nārā yapiya section (chapters 335-351 of Citraśala ed. = cr. ed. 322–339) of the Sāntiparva and the Bhagavadgita. For the

antiquity of Krsṇa worship (vide pp. 129-131 above). Megasthenes states that Heracles (Harikroṇa ? ) was worshipped by Soursenoi (Saurasenas ) on the banks of Jobaros (Yamunā) and had two oities Methora (Mathurā ) and Cleisbora ( Kṭspapura ? ). In the Nārāyaniya it is stated (in chap. 335, 17-24) that king Uparicara Vasu was a devotee ( bhakta ) of Nārāyaṇa, that he worshipped the Lord of Gods according to the sātivata rules that were proclaimed by the Sun, that he (Vasu) consecrated his kingdom, wealth, wife and horses to God, thinking that they all belonged to the Bhagavat (the Adorable One ) and performed sacrificial rites according to the Sāttvata rules. 

In the Sāntiparva, Satvata and Pancarātra are identified 1541 and it is said that the seven sages called 'citraśikhandin' (lit. whose top-knots on the head were bright or wonderful) viz. Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha, proclaimed the (Pāñcarātra ) śāstra and God Nārāyana told them that the śāstra would be authoritative in the world and that king Vasu would learn the sāstra from Bphaspati to whom it would come by degrees from the seven sages. Chapter 336 of Santi declares that to the north of the Milky Sea there was territory called Svetadvipa, where dwelt devotees of Nārāyana who were called 1542 • Ekāntin' and Pāñcarātra is called 'Ekānta-dharma'. À peculiar doctrine of the Pāñcarātra school is that of the four wyūhas (mūrtis or forms) viz. that the Supreme Person is Vasudeva, the individual soul is Sāṅkarṣana, Pradyuma is mind and springs from Saṅkarsana and Aniruddha is ahankāra and originates from Pradyumna. 1543 It is this doctrine of the four forms of Vāsudeva, each springing from the preceding, that is refuted according to Śhaṅkara in the Brahmasūtra II. %. 42-45. The śānti 348. 8 expressly refers to the Gitā as already declared

The Alwar literature mentions fivefold aature viz, Pars and the others. Vide K. Č. Varadachari's paper on Some contri butions of Alwars to the philosophy of bhakti' in Silver Jabilee vol. of BORI, p. 621. The Paramasa óbitā (1. 39-40 G.O. S. ed.) states that the five great Elements, the five Tanmatras, Abamkāra, Baddhi and aupakta, ( five categories or Tattvas of the Saṅkhya ) are the night ( as it were ) of the Puran and therefore this lastra (which propounds how to be free from the moshes of these five ) is called Pancarātra.

authority, while others like Apararka p. 13 and Paribhayaprakasa (p. 23 ) do not accept it as thoroughly Vodio but only partialy. 

In the Vedāntasūtra 1547 there are four sūtras dealing with the Bhagavata or Panoarātra system. The great Acāryas are not agreed upon their interpretation, Śhaṅkara saying that all the four sūtras refute some tenets of the Bhagavatas, Rāmāpnja saying that the first two sūtras ( out of four ) contain refutation of the Bhagavata doctrine and the other two do not. Saṅkard cārya makes it clear that the doctrinos of the Bhagavatag that the Supreme God Vāsudeva is the Highest Truth, that he assumes four forms, that the worship of Vāsudeva consists in continuous single-minded contemplation of Vasudeva are not the targets for attack, that what is refuted is the dootrine of the Bhāgavatas that the individual soul called Saṅkarṣana by them springs from Vāsudeva, that Pradyumna ( mind) arises from Śhaṅkarasana and that Aniruddha (ahamkāra ) arises from Pradyumna. It appears from Śhaṅkara's remarks 154 on II. 2. 45 that in his day Śāṇdilya was supposed to have promulgated the Bhāgavata or Pāncarātra śāstra, because he did not find the 

1547. The four sūtras in the Vedāntasūtra (II. 2. 42-45) are: 

para, a nd rura, ferate an aquaru:, fardura. Though Rāma puja enlarges upon the Pancarātra doctrine in his comments on the last two sūtras out of these four and quotes three passages that may be called Panca rātra, he does not avow either in his Srībbāsya or in bis Vedārtha-saigraha that he is a Sātvata or Pāñcarātra. ___1548. वेदविप्रतिषेधश्च भवति । चतुर्ष घेवेषु परं श्रेयोऽलग्या शाण्डिल्य इदं शासमाधि Taurorullarreara 1 SITE T164 on

highest blles in all the four Vedas. In the Dropaparya ( 29. 26-29) there is another and different reference to the four murtis of the Supreme for the benefit of the worlds viz. one performs tapas (asuterities) on the earth, the 2nd has an eye on the world's good and evil deeds; the third comes to the world in a human form and does such acts as men perform; the 4th alumbers for a thousand years and when it arises from slumber conferr the highest boons on those who deserve them. 

It may be noted that even in the Mahabharata Nārada'a name is connected with Pancarātra. It is said ' this very secret doctrine, connected with the four Vedas, having the benefit of Saṅkhya and Yoga and spoken of as Pañcarātra, was (originally) uttered by the lips of Nārāyaṇa and was again communicated by Narada. 1549 

Other great sources of the cult of bhakti are the Bhagavad gita, which is expressly mentioned in the Nārāyaṇiya section (348.8 %D cr.ed. 336.8), the Bhagavatapurana and the Viṣṇu purāṇa. The Gitā contains the words bhakti and bhakta several dozens of times. It may be stated here that the so-called Narada bhaktisutras, Narada-pancarātra, the Sandilya-bhakti-sutra and the several extant Palivaratra-samhitas so far published are all later than the Gita. 1550 The Agnipurana gives the names of 25 works on Pancaratra quoted in the note below.1551The Mahesvara

The reasons for this statement are not relevant to this work, but by way of example, attention may be drawn to some Sāṇdilya-rūtras : तवेव कर्मिज्ञानियोगिग्य आधिक्यशब्दात्, प्रश्ननिरूपणाम्यामाधिक्यसिद्धः (I. 2. 22-23 in Jivanand's ed. = I. 2. 15-16 in भक्तिचन्द्रिका), which clearly refer to Gita VI. 46-47 and XII, 1 and 6-7 respectively. There is one sūtra where the Gita is expressly mentioned viz. सैकान्तभावो गीतार्थप्रत्यभिज्ञानात् (II. 2. 83 in Jiva nand's ed. - II. 2.28 in भक्तिचन्द्रिका). स्वमेश्वर comments on this सा परा भक्तिरेवैकान्तभावो नान्यः कुतः। मीतार्थेन प्रत्यभिज्ञाश्रवणात्। पथा नारायणीय एव 'सहोप. निषदो"ऋषिणापि धा' (शान्ति 348. 5-6) इति प्रक्षे प्रत्युत्तरम्। 'समुपोढेष्वनीकेषु" भंगवता खयम् ।। (शान्ति 348.8) । तस्मादेकान्तिता परा भक्तिरिति ।।

There is an extensive Literature on the Bhakti cult. Only a few of the important works in Sanskrit, their translations and works in English are noted here. Barth, Hopkins, Keith, Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar and others have propounded different theories as to what Krsna represented, how he was identified with Viṣṇu who appears to be another name of the Sun in the Rgveda and came to be regarded as the highest God in Brahmana times (as in Ait. Br. 'Agnir-vai devānām avamah, Viṣṇuh paramaḥ) and came to be identified with sacrifice (Yajāo vai Viṣṇuḥ). When Kroṇa, the friend of the Pandavas was identified with the Supreme Spirit, the full-fledged doctrine of Avatāras appeared as in the Gita. The important works on bhakti are : The Narayapiya section of the Santiparya (chapters 322–351 in the Citraśālā edition and chap. 322-339 of the critical edition ); the Bhagavadgitā; several Purāṇas, the most important being Viṣṇu and Bhagavata ; 1852 the Bhaktisūtra of Sandilya with the bhāṣya of Svapneśvara (ed. by Jivananda, Calcutta 1876) and translation of both these ( in B. I. series ) by E. B. Cowell 

1532. It is remarkable that the Bhagavata, wbich is practically the most important or sole authority for all great medieval Vaigava teachers like Vallabha and Caitanya and their disciples, is not quoted anywhere by Rāmā nuja ( who was born in sake 1049 i. e. 1127 A. D.) in his bhāsya on the Brahmasūtras, when he quotes over a hundred verses from the Viṣṇupurāṇa in the same. In fact, in the Vedārthsaigraba Rāmānuja states that la the name way as the section (anuvāka) on Nārāyaṇa among all fruti texts serves to expound the special aspect of highest Brahma so the Vigopurāga also defines a special aspect of the highest Brahma and that all other Purīgas should be so interpreted as aot to be in conflict with it at hele tatt केवलपरमाखरूपविशेषगदर्शनापैव प्रात्तो नारापणादवाकस्तयेवं वैष्णवं च पुराण"परमहा स्वरूपविशेषनिर्णयायैव प्रवृत्तम् । अन्यानि सर्वाणि पुराणान्येतदविरोधेन नेयानि। पेवार्थसंग्रह para 110-111 pp. 141-142 (D.

It is donecessary in this work to refer to the numerous commentaries of the disciples and followers of Madhva and other great Valsnava ācāryas. The position of Vallabhācārya ( 1479–1531 A.

Before proceeding with the treatment of bhakti in the Purāṇas the words 'bhakti' and 'Bhagavata' must be briefly defined and explained. Sāṇdilya defines 1553a 'bhakti' as 's

paranuraktirisyare'. This may be interpreted in two ways the highest form of bhakti is affection fixed on God' or 'bhakti is the highest affection fixed on God'. Svapnegyara, the author of a bhāsya on Sandilya, prefers the first and Narada-bhakti sūtra, Tilak and others favour the second. Svapnesvara explains that in general 'bhakti' means 'affection fixed on a being that is to be won over or worshipped', but that in this sastra it means 'a particular state of the mind having the Supreme Lord as its object' and quotes & verge from the Viṣṇupurāṇa uttered by the great devotee Prahlada May that fixed (or unwavering) love, which the ignorant (or unreflecting) people feel for worldly objects, nover depart from my heart, ever remembering you'. The Gitā employs the word 'priti' (affection) and conveys that the word 'bhakti' is derived from the root 'bhaj' to resort to, 'Those whose minds are on me, whose lives are offered to me, who instruct each other, who speak of me, are always contented and happy. On these who are continuously devoted to me and serve me with affection, I bestow that knowledge by which they roach me'. Svapnośvara explains that the word 'anurakti' (with prefix 'anu') is employed to convey that the affection for God arises after the devotee secures knowledge of the greatness and other attributes of the Bhagavat (Adorable One). In the 

Viṣṇupurāṇa the word 'anurāga' is used for 'bhakti', where, after describing the ascent of Rāma and his brothers to heaven, it says that the people of the capital of Kosala who had deep affection for those incarnate parts of the Bhagavat (Viṣṇu ) having their minds fixed on them, reached the position of residence in the same world with them. Sārdilya further 1553 says that there is the teaching that there is immortality for him who abides in Him. In the Chandogya Up. it is said 'He who abides in brahman reaches immortality'. The idea is that immortality being the promise of abiding in God, there will be no indifference in the effort to know God or in the effort to

cultivate highest affection for God. It may be noticed that the sūtras of Nārada appear to be a more paraphrase of Sandilya's aphoriams. 1594 Sandilya furthor (sūtra 7) provides that bhakti, like knowledge, is not an action because it does not follow an effort of the will and that (sūtra 9) it is different from jñāna, as the Gitā refers to self-surrender being attained by one having knowledge after many births (Gitā VII 19). 

Our ancestors had a great penchant for classifications, divisions and sub-divisions. Bhakti is divided into laukiki (of the common people), Vaidiki (laid down by the Veda) and adhyatmiki (philosophical), as in Padma V. 15. 164; or mānasi (mental), vāciki (verbal) and kāyiki ( done with the body, such es fasts, vratas &c.) in Padma V. 15. 165–168; into Sāttviki, Rājasi and Tāmasi (as in Bhagavata III. 29.7–10 and Padma VI. 126. 4-11); into best, middling and inferior as in Brahmānda III.1555 34. 38-41 ). 

Prapatti (self-surrender) is distinguished from bhakti in works of the Rāmānuja and of other Vaiṣṇava schools. It consists of five points 1556 viz. resolution to yield (to God's will), the abandoning of opposition, faith that God will protect (the devotee ), praying to God to save the devotee, and a feeling of helplessness shown by casting one's soul on Him. Bhakti bas As synonyms the words' dhyāna', 'upāsanā' &o. and is subsidiary to prapatti. The Gita explicitly makes no such distinction. In Gita II. 7 Arjuna speaks of himself as 'prapanna' (who has approached or surrendered himself for salvation).

Gita on bhakti

to me, offer adoration tome; you will certainly reach me; I declare to you truly, you are dear to me. Giving up all (dharmas) duties, come to me as your (only) refuge; I shall release you from all ging; do not griove : 1557 Vide also Gita VII, 14, 15 and XV. 4 for other instances of the use of the root 'pra-pad'. The theory propounded in the Gītā and other works on bhakti was that bhakti led on to 'prasada' (favour or grace) of God which enables the devotee to attain mokṣa. 1558 The Gitā (18.56, 58, 62 ) says 'a man, though always performing all actions, but solely depending on me, obtains an imperishable and eternal place through my favour; if you fix your mind on me, you will get over all difficulties through my favour; go to Him as the refuge with all your heart, O Arjuna, through His grace you will attain the highest peace and an everlasting abode. In the Vispupurāṇa Prahlāda 1559 is told by the Adorable One as your mind is firmly and devotedly fixed on me you will by my favour attain the highest bliss'. The idea of God's grace oocurs both in the Katha and Svetāśvatara Upaniṣads : 1560. The Self, smaller than the small and greater than the great, is hidden in the heart of the creatures; a man who is free from willing anything and free from grief sees the greatness of the Self through the favour of the Creator'. 

There is a great difference between the Gita and the Nārāyaniya section. In the former, though the Supreme Soul is called Vasudeva, 1567 the doctrine of the four vyūbas, that is very

characteristic of the Nārāyaniya section, is totally absont and further even the names of Saṅkarṣana, Pradyumna and Ani ruddha do not occur in the Gita. In my opinion the Gita is the older of the two, as it propounds the general doctrine of bhakti, while the Pāñcarātra doctrine in the Nārāyaniya is only one of the several bhakti schools. Moreover, the Nārāyaplya section represents that Gita had already been proclaimed and that the knowledge brought from Śyetadvipa by Nārada is the same as that declared in the Harigita (chap. 346. 10–11, 348. 53-54). Santi ( 348. 55-57 ) mentions that there was only one vyūha or there were two, three or four and that the Ekāntins attached great importance to ahimsā. Besides, the worship of Vābudova is older than Pāṇini, since 1562 Pāṇini teaches the formation of the word Vasudevaka as meaning 'one whose object of worship is Vasudeva'. Vide Dr. Bhandarkar's Vaiṣṇavism, Saivism &c.' paragraphs 2-10 (pp. 3–19 of vol. IV of the collected works) for the antiquity of Vasudeva worship. The general view of most medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra about Pancarātra is represented by the Pārijāta quoted in the K. R. that the Panca rātra 1563 and Pāśupata śāstras are authoritative only so far as they are not opposed to the Vedas. This was the view of the Sūtasambitā also, on which a commentary was composed by the famous Madhavācārya. 

In some Purāṇas the word Vasudeva is not derived 1561 from Vasudeva ( as the son of Vasudeva) but from the root yas' to dwell.. Vāsudeva is so called because all beings dwell in the Highest Self and Vasudeva dwells in beings as the soul of all'. Compare Gitā 9. 29'I am alike to all beings; none is odious to me nor dear; but those who worship me with faith dwell in me 

and I too dwell in them'.

Meaning of bhagavat' and obhagavatā' 

Ø8$ 

The word bhagavat oalls for a brief notice. It was generally applied to Vasudeva. The Viṣṇupuriṇa says The word bhaga is applied to the six qualities collectively viz. fulness of sway, manliness (or energy), glory, auspiciousness, knowledge and indifference to wordly objects. This noble word bhagavān applies to Vasudeva who is the Highest Brahma and to no one else'. 1565 The Viṣṇupurana 1566 further states that the word + bhagavat' may be applied secondarily to others on the ground of possessing special qualities " that person may be oalled 'bhagavān', who knows about the creation and dissolution (of the world), about the origin and final destiny of beings, and knows what is vidya and avidyā ( nescience). Knowledge, strength power, sway, manliness, splendour all these in their entirety, excluding the thres guṇas (and their effects ) that are to be avoided, are expressed by the word bhagavat". Bhagavata is one who worships 'Bhagavat'(ie. Vasudeva). This is an ancient word. It ocours in the Begnagar column inscription of the 2nd century BC.) of Heliodora, a Greek of Takṣaśila and ambassador of Antalikita, who calls himself a bhagavata (adevotee of Vasudeva); vide above p. 516 n. 742 and 'Indo-Greeks' by Prof. A. K, Narain (1957), where at end hegives the full Besnagara Ins. of nine lines and its reading (Plate VI.). It appears that 'bhagayat' was rarely applied to Siya also. The Svetāśvatara Upaniṣad speaks 1547 of Sive as 'bhagavan'. Patanjali in his bhasya on Panini V.2.76 speaks of Śivabhagavata. 156s In the Ghostindi stone

Inscription 1569 in Sanskrit ( near Nagari in the Chitorgadh District of Rajputana ) there is a reference to both Saṅkarṣaṇa and Vasudeva as bhagarat and it calls them Sarveśvara (about 200 B. C.), while the Besnagara inscription speaks of Vāsudova alone and Heliodora calls himself bbāgavata. In some early records such as the Pikira grant of Simbavarman ( E. I. vol. VII. p. 161 ) and in Gupta Inscription No. 4 (at p. 27) Simbavarinen and Candragupta (II) son of Samudragupta are called 

paramabhāgauna'. Akrūra is styled mahābhāgavata in Brahma purāṇa 190, 20; Padma VI. 280. 27 defines a Mahabhāgavata as noted below. 1570 

Three mārgas ( paths) are spoken of in ancient works viz. karmamārga, bhaktimārga and jñānamārga. It is necessary to say here something about the path of bhakli and that of jñana. Both these paths are deemed to lead to the same goal, viz mokṣa. The mode of approach in the two is, however, different, In the path of knowledge (or ayaktajāsanā) it is not bare book knowledge of brahman as the Supreme Soul and as nirguna that will lead to mokṣa; for that purpose wbat is required is the brāhmi-sthiti (state of identifying oneself with brahma) men. tioned in Gitā II. 72. This condition can be secured only by great efforts and long practice as described in Gitā II. 55 and the following verses. In the path of knowledge whatever actions the person concerned may do are brahmārpana, as described in Gita IV. 18–24. In the path of bhakti the bhakta resigns him self to God's grace and whatever be does Le consigos to the God worshipped by him such as Vasudeva (saguna and vyakla). Arjuna asks the Lord a question in Gitā XII, 1 of the worship pers who thus constantly devoted meditate on you and those wbo (meditate ) on the Unparceived and Indestructible, which

best know devotion'. The reply given in XII. 2-7 is those who, being constantly devoted and possogged of the highest devotion, worship me with a mind fixed on me are regarded by me as the most devoted. But those who, restraining the group of the senses, and with a mind equable to all, meditate on the indes cribable, indestructible, udperceived (Principle), which is all pervading, inconceivable, unconcerned, immoveable, and constant, they, devoted to the good of all beings, certainly attain to me. In the case of those whose minds are attached to the unperceived ( Principle or Spirit) the trouble is much greater, since the unperceived goal is attained by embodied beings with difficulty. In the case of those, however, who dedicating all their actions to me and regarding me as their highest goal worship me, meditating on me with a devotion towards none beside me and whose minds are placed on me, I, without delay, become their deliverer from the ocean of saṁsāra and death'. In chapter 9 the path of bhakti is spoken of in these terms it is the chief among vidyās (lores), chief among mysteries; it is the best means of sanctification; it can be directly apprehended, it is in accordance with dharma, imperishable and easy to practise'. According to the Gitā, therefore, the path of bhakti is easier than the path of knowledge. 

The Bhagavata says that bhakti is ninefold 1571 viz, hearing about Viṣṇu, repeating his name, remembering him, worshipping the feet (of the image of Viṣṇu), offering pūja, bowing (or homage), treating oneself as the slave of Viṣṇu, treating Him as a friend and surrendering one's soul to Him. According 1572 to Narada-bhakti-sūtra it is elevenfold (as noted below). It is

not to be supposed that all these nine methods have to be pra otised at the same time. A devotee practising any one of these, vir, remembering or reciting His name, may thereby become & true bhakta, and may win God's favour and secure liberation (Sandilyasūtra 73). The Gitā (VII. 16-17) states 'four classes of men, who are (all) fortunate, worship me viz. one who is in distress, the seeker after knowledge, one who seeks some desired object (or seeks wealth), one who is possessed of knowledge; of these he who is possessed of knowledge, who is always devoted and who worships One (Being) only is distinguished (above others ), for to the man of knowledge I am extremely dear and he is dear to me'. Sāedilya provides that the four aspects (out of nine) viz. remembering God, reciting His name, Darrating stories about Him and bowing to Him (His imago), find their place in the bhakti of those who are distressed, for these are said to be the means of expiation of sins, as the Viṣṇupurāṇa says (II. 6. 39) that remembering Krsna is superior to all praya ścittas. Sandilya further says that those guilty of mortal (grave) sins are only entitled to the bbakti of the distressed; but when their sins have been wiped off they would be entitled to the other forms of bhakti. 

Gitā does not expressly enumerato all thega nine modes of bhakti, but most of them can be gathered from various passages of the Gitā such as IX. 14, 26, 27 and from passages in other Purāṇas. For example, the Viṣṇupurāṇa 1573 says 'whatever be the expiatory rites, consisting of austerities, deeds of charity &o., to romembor Krṣna is superior to them all' and 'that repetition of His name with bhakti is the best solvent of all sins, as fire is of metals'. In the Bhagavata "571 it is said 'whatever the devotee does by his body, speech, mind, organs of sense, by his intelleot or by his soul or by the force of temperament that he follow all that he should offer to Nārāyaṇa who is highest'. This is entirely in line with Gitā IX. 27 and may be called *dāsya-bhakti'; while Arjuna's bhakti is 'sakhya-bhakti', 28 Lord Krspa himselt speaks of him as 'my devotee and a friend' (Gita

The position of the Guta as to worship and one's duties 967 

IV.3). It appears that the Gits regards the performance t575 of the duties of his station in life by a bhakta as worship (arcana or pūja) of God 'worshipping by the performance of one's duties (without an eye to the fruit or towards of them ) God from whom the world springs and by whom all this world is permeated, a man obtains perfection (and not only by offering flowers or by reciting the name of God). 

This central doctrine of the Gitā of what is called 'niskām karma' was accepted by the Purāṇas, The Viṣṇu II, 3.25 adopts it. The Agnipurāṇa in chapter 381 gives a summary of the . Gitā in 58 verses which are mostly made up of passages from the Gitā. It winds up the summary with the verse quoted in note 1575 and emphasizes bhakti in the last verse. 1576 The Garuḍa-purāṇa summarises the Gītā in 28 verses (I. 237-238). The Padma (in VI. 171-188) contains the mahatmya of each of the 18 chapters of the Gitā interspersed with legends about the fruit of reading each Gitā chapter (1005 verses in all). A few further examples may be cited. The Kūrma saya 1577 'therefore even & man not possessed of (high) wisdom should perform all his duties (or actions ) abandoning with all efforts the fruit (or roward) of actions; he obtains (high) abode after some time'; *actions done after offering them to me do not tend to bind down the door but tend to mukti (liberation). The Mārkandeya also refers to 'niskāma-karma'. The Bhagavata-purāña provides ‘a man performing (the rites) proscribed by the Veda but with out attachment (not caring for the reward) and surrendering them to God Secures freedom from the bondage of karma and the deolaration of the roward (in the Veda) is only meant for stimulating effort.'

about God or the ultimate destiny of man or the way to God and did not solve the common man's problems. The Gita took up the problems of the common man; it shows to the lowliest of the lowly that there is hope for him, that the One and the True Being can enter into his life, if he consecrates all the daily duties and Botions of his station in life to God and that salvation will come to every one if one has loving faith in God and surrenders him. self entirely to his Grace. The Gita proclaims (IX. 30-32) 'If even a man that has been very badly conducted worships me without worshipping any one else he should be regarded as a good man, since he has resolved upon the right course; he quickly becomes a righteous soul and reaches everlasting peace: O Arjuna! you may affirm that my devotee is never ruined. By taking refuge with me even those that are born in despised castes, also women, vaiśyas and sūdras reach the highest goal'. The Sandilya-bhakti-sūtra provides 1578 that all down to persons of the despised castos are entitled (to follow the path of bhakti) as they are capable of learning bhakti at second hand just ag they can learn the common rules (of ahimsā, truthfulness &o.). The Puranas speak in the same strain as the Gita and are some times even more explicit and emphatic. The Brahma-purāṇa paraphrases Gita IX, 32 and proceeds 'my devotee even if he be & candāla attains the desired beatitude, if he be endowed with the right faith; what need be said about others?' The Padma 1579 states A Pulkasa or even a svāpaka and other persons belong. ing to Mleccha tribes become eminent and worthy of being honoured, if they are solely devoted to the worship of the feet of Hari'; ' Even a śvapāka is a Vaiṣṇava if on his lips there is the name of Hari, in whose heart there is Visgu and in whose stomach goes food offered to Viṣṇu'.

These sentiments were not mere platitudes, but had been very largely acted upon. Even in the medieval ages in India we have women saints like Mirabai and Āṇdāļ (in South India), untouchables as saints like Nanda, Cokhāmeļā (in Mahārāṣtra), Rai Das (a chāmār disciple of Rāmānanda), sinners like Ajāmila honoured as saints, Saints like Kabir 1582 (a Moslem weaver) and Tukārām.had probably not much book learning, but their hymns are recited by Hindus including orthodox brāhmaṇas. 

The invasions and gradual conquest of India by Moslem in vaders from the Northwest throw down a challenge to Hindus from 11th century A.D. onwards. It was met in various ways. The first was the composition of comprehensive digests of amstis of which the earliest extant one is the Kștyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara (about 1110-1130 A.D.) in the North and Hemādri in the Docoan (third quarter of 13th century). The second and the most important way was on the spiritual front. From the 13th to the 17th century there was a great revival of spirituality on an unprecedented scale which produced saints and mystios in all parts of India such as Jõāneśvara, Nāmadeva, Rāmānanda, Kabir, 1582 Caitanya, 

1581, Palkasas and Svapākas were degraded and untouchable castes, Vide H. of Dh, vol. II pp. 88-89 for Pulkasa and p. 97 for Svapāka (lit. who subsists on dog-ment). Pulkasa occurs in Vāj. S. 30. 17. Kirātas are assigned to caves in vaj. S. 30. 16. The Abbīras are described as dasyus and mlecchas in Mausala-parva 7. 46-63, they are said to have attacked Arjuna in Pañcanada when he was taking women with him after Krona's passing away and to have carried away Vrani women (Mausala 8. 16-17). Vide also the same account in Vinnupurāṇa V, 38. 12-28, Matsya 273, 18 speaks of ten Abhira kings. The Khasa tribe had the custom of a brother war- . rying his deceased brother's widow.

He preached, ā doctrine of theism that did not tolerate polytheism, incarnations and idols. Kabir is said to have been a disciple of Rāmāpanda (who lived about 1400-1470 A. D.), an ascetic who preached at Benares that God should be worshiped under the name of Rāma. Kabir beld to the doctrines of Karma and Transmigration. He believed in the unity of God, but makes use of many names such as Rāma, Khudā, Allah, Sakti lo speaking of Him. :!:

Dadu (in Rajasthan), Nanak, Vallabhacārya, Ekanātha, Tukārām, Rāmadāsa ( and many others of lesser famo) who all agreed on fundamentals viz. unity of God, the need of self-purification, com demnation of the pride of caste and of formalities of worship, and Surrender to the Deity for salvation. The third was the creation of such independent kingdoms as that of Vijayanagara (1330 1565 A. D.), of Mahārāstra (under Shivaji and the Peshwas) and of the Sikhs in Punjab. This last cannot be dealt with way in this work. The doctrine of bhakti had a great appeal to all sections of the Hindu community and its propagation by the Purāṇas went a long away in weaning away Hindus from Buddhism. Not only so, Mahāyāna Buddhism took over the doctrine of bhakti and works like the Questions of Milinda' and the Saddharmapuṇdarika 1583 contain passages which agree closely with the Gita. The Gitā exhibits a wonderful spirit of tolerance and accommodation, not found in the scriptures of other religions which were founded by great prophets. It says 1584 even those, who are devotees of other deities and worship them with faith, ( indirectly) worship me only but with a pon-śāstric (or irregular ) procedure.' The Bhāgavata-purāṇa elaborates the same idea; O Adorable One! others worship you alone in the form of Śiva while following the path promulgated by Śiva and propounded in different ways by several acūryas, all worship you who are Lord and who comprehend in yourself all gods; those also who are devotees of other deities and appear to have different ideas do in the end reach you, just as all rivers rising in mountains and flooded by rains enter the ocean from all sides'. The Santiparva 1585 also contains a similar idea Those who worship Brahma, Śiva or other deities and whose conduct (or practice ) is intelligent will (ultimately ) come to me, who am the Highest'. This doctrine has ita gorms in the Roveda 1586

itself where it is said the One Reality the Bages speak of under Various names; they call it Agni, Yama, Matari van (wind-god )'. This work cannot afford, for reasons of space, to go into the several bhakti schools such as those of Rāmānuja, Madhya (who postulated five eternal bhedas), Caitanya and Vallabha ( that gave rise to an erotico-mystical brand of bhakti ) and others. 

In their zoal for the spread of the oult of bhakti the Purāṇas are sometimes guilty of gross exaggeration. The Brahma purāṇa 1587 says 'mon even after having committed many sins under the influence of error (or delusion ), do not go to Hell, if they worship Hari who removes all sing; those men also who always remember Janārdana, though they may be guilty of roguery, reach, after they die, the happy world of Viṣṇu. Even a man who is habituated to flying into extreme rage, if he recites the name of Hari, has his faults destroyed and attains mukti (liberation ) as the king of Cedi country did'. The Vāmana purāṇa 1588 observes “what has that person got to do with many mantras (i, e, he has no use for those), who is a bhakta of Viṣṇu ? The mantra 'namo Nārāyaṇāya' is able to accomplish all objects. Success is for those who have bhakti for Viṣṇu; how can there be failure for them in whose heart is enthroned Janārdana dark like a blue lotus ?" The Vamana and Padma Purāṇas say that a man secures the same results by repeating the names of Viṣğu that he would secure by visiting all the tirthas ( sacred places) and holy shrinos 1589 in the world. 

Many Purāṇas, particularly the Viṣṇu and the Bhāgavata, · are replete with the eulogies, the theory and practice of bhakti

and illustrative stories about it. For reasons of space it is not possible to go into this matter at any length. A fow noteworthy points alone will be touched. A few versos eulogising the Bhagavatapurāpa may be cited as samples of extreme exaggera tion. Thousands 1590 of Aśvamedhas and hundreds of Vājapoya sacrifices are not equal to even the 16th part of the story narrated by Suka; he who always recitos a half or a quarter verse of the Bhagavata secure the merit of Rajasūya and Aśvamedha; he who listens to the words of the śāstra of Suka ( i.e. Bhagavata ) at the time of death, Govinda being pleased with him confers on him Vaikuntha; this is a good expiation for all sinners viz. uttering the name of Viṣṇu, since ( at that time) their mind has Viṣpu as the only object of thought'. 1591 Another point is the story of Ajāmila in the Bhāgavata (VI. 1. 20 ff and VI. 2), Padma( L 31. 109 and VI. 87.7 ) and other Purāṇas. Ajāmila 1592 ( who aban doned his brāhmana wife and kept a mistress) was a moral wreck addicted to gambling and thieving. When on his death bed at the age of 80 he loudly called upon his youngest son named Nārāyana (out of ten sons born of the mistress ) with affection and recited that name and thought of that alone, he became free from his sing and attained a high position difficult to attain'. Such stories have given rise to the common belief that the last thought at one's death leads to a new birth appro priate to that thought (unte matih sā gatih). The Upaniṣads contain the germ of the idea of the last thought; vide, Chān. Up. III, 14, 1, VIII. 2. 10, Bļ. Up. IV. 4. 5. In the 'Questions of Milinda' (SBE vol. 35 pp. 123–124) this idea of the importance of the last thought is taken up. It may be that a single heart-felt invocation of the name of God, a single act of faith after

The idea of the last thought 

repentance and complete surrender to God's will, cancels the result of a whole life of crime and sin. This is the moral of Ajāmila's atory, but it is liable to be grossly misapprehended and might create a complacent belief that a man may commit as many sins in his life as possible, but if he remembers God at his death and repeats His name then, all sins of his are cleared away and wiped out. This is a rather dangerous doctrine. The Gita ( VIII. 5-7) puts the matter in a clear light. "That person, who remembers me at the time of death and passes from the world leaving the body, attains my essence, there is no doubt about that. Whatever form a man remembers when he leaves the body, to that he goes, because he was always engrossed in that form. Therefore remem ber me at all times and engage in battle; there is no doubt that having fixed your mind and intellect on me you will attain to me'. This passage of the Gṛtā suggests that a person will remember the name of God at the time of his death only if he had been 80 doing all his life, while engaged in actively performing all his duties and not caring for the rewards thereof and that it is extremely rare or almost impossible for a man to remember God at the last moment when throughout his life he had been ungodly and a great sinner. The above idea is again emphasized in verses 10-13 of chap. VIII (of the Gitā) and in chap. XIII, 3 (yo yac-chraddhaḥ sa ova saḥ). 

In spite of the doctrine that God is one 1593 and the doctrine that whatever form of the deity one may worship, the worship reaches the Supreme Being, Vaiṣṇavas and Śaivas have been wrangling and abusing one another. For example, the Varāha 

1590. The proposition that God is only one, that He is worshipped under various perceptible forms for concentrating the mind on Him, worship or contemplation of a formless object being difficult, are doctrines taught in the Purāgas in spite of the fact that tbey preach worship of Viṣaa, Kroa, Śiva, Devi and others. Vide H, of Dh, vol. II pp. 714-715 and pp. 118-119 above. The facusema I. 65. 32 states: Firehta शक्रोति चिन्तितुम् । अन्यथा तु सुकट स्यानिरालम्बस्य चिन्तनम् । ride also विष्णुधर्मोचर III. 108, 23 ff, particularly the verse Aral T AERUM FIT uta ta: Haut wala man TIE \# 26. Indian theologians and philosophers deliberately spared lower forms of worship with the thought that it was better to begin at a lower rung of the ladder to the highest goal than not to have a footing at all.

purana makos Rudra declare the supremaoy of Viṣṇu (obap. 15% 70.14 Narayanah paro devah), denounce Śaiva-siddhantas that are outside the pale of the Vedas and put forward the outstanding view 'that such non-Vedic views were promulgated by Śiva himself at the request of Viṣṇu in order to delude people. Some Purāṇas started by saying that the Bauddhas and Jainas 1595 were asuras and enemies of gods that were purposely deluded by god. For example, the Matsya (24. 43-49) says that the sons of Raji deprived Indra of his kingdom and share in sacrifices, that Brhaspati, at Indra's request, deluded the sons of Raji by composing a treatise of Jina-dharma which was opposed to the Veda and then Indra killed them. Vāyu 96. 230-32, Matsya 47. 11-12, Bhagavata I. 3. 24 appear to suggest that Viṣṇu himself deluded the people. The Agni (16. 1-4) also says with reference to the Bauddhas that Viṣṇu deluded them. The Viṣṇu purana 1536 (III. 17-18) narrates that when the gods were

Asuras in the form of heretics purposely misled by Viṣṇu 975 

defeated by the asuras (who also practised tapas and studied the Veda) they approached Viṣṇu and prayed to him to help them and to destroy the asuras and that then Viṣṇu produoed from his body Māyā-moha (lit. who causes delusion by wiles) and made him over to the gods. Māyāmoha, who was naked, had shaved his head and held a bunch of peacock feathers in his hand, went to the asuras that were practising tapas on the banks of the Narmadā (III. 18. 1-2) and told them that if they followed his words they would secure mukti, led them away from the path of the Voda, taught them formulas of sceptical reasoning and weaned them away from their dharma. Then he approached other asuras and taught them that sacri ficing animals was sinful, taught them nirvāṇa and the doctrines of vijnanavāda. Some of the passages are very striking 'In a short time the asuras were deluded by Māyāmoha and abandoned all concern with the path depending on the three Vedas. Some condemned the Vedas, some condemned the gods, while others condemned the body of sacrificial rites and brāhmaṇas. (They thought or said) The statement that killing an animal (in sacrifices) is desirable for the sake of Dharma (for accumulating merit) does not stand to reason; to say that offerings burnt by fire would conduce to reward (in the next world) is childish talk; ( if it be said that ) Indra attained the position of God by means of many sacrifices and enjoys the fuel-sticks of the sami tree, then an animal ( that subsists on leaves) is superior to Indra (who enjoys hard and thorny sami samidhs). If it is desired (by the Veda) that the animal killed in & sacrifice attains heaven, then why does not the sacrificer kill his own father in & sacrifice (and send him to heaven)? If one (the son) performs śrāddha (with the thought) that what is eaten by one (brāhmaṇa diner at śrāddha) tends to give satisfaction to another (i, e. the deceased father of the offeror of śrāddha), then travellers would not carry food ( on their baoka) which causes weariness to them.' These are the arguments used by atheists (oārvākas). It is remarkable that even tāntrik works like the Kulārṇavatantra make Śiva say that he declared certain sāstras purely for deluding certain bad people who did not know the Kaula dharma.1597

proceeded so far as to say 153 that a brāhmapa who is not a Valspava is a heretic, that Vispu himself assuming the form of Buddha proclaimed a false sastra, and that all sastras such as the Pasupata, Vaibeṣika of Kanāda, Nyāya of Gautama, Saṅkhya of Kapila, Carvaka of Bṛbaspati are tāmgan; that the māyāvāda (of Śhaṅkara) is a false sastra and is disguised Bauddha (doctrine) and the extensive śāstra (Pūrvamlmā gā) of Jaimini is con demned, since it made gods as of no use ( in his system ). The words of the Padma-purāṇa are ; 'Listen O Goddess, while I declare to you in order the tā masa śāstras, by merely remembering which even wise men become singers.

Kaṇāda proclaimed the great Vaiśeṣika system, the Nyāya and Saṅkhya systems were declared respectively by Gautama and Kapila : the much despised Carpāka doctrine was declared by Bphaspati, while Viṣṇu, assuming the form of Buddha, promulgated, for bringing about the destruction of dailyas, the false doctrine of Bauddbas that go about naked or dressed in blue garments; I myself, O goddess, assuming the form of a brahmapa declared in the Kali age the false gāstras of the doctrine of Māyā which is bauddha in disguise. The brāhmaṇa Jaimini composed the great system of Pūrvamimāṁsa, which is unmeaning on account of its atheistic discourse'. Vijñāna-bhikṣu in his Saṅkhya-pravacanabhāsya ( who flourished about 1550 A. D.) quotes eleven verges from the Padma VI. 263 and holds the peculiar view that no śāstra that is ūstika (admits & soul ) is unauthoritative nor is there any contradiction, each śāstra being of full force and true in its own sphere. The original Saṅkhya sūtra, on which he comments, tries to establish the impossible thesis that the teachings of the Saṅkhya are not in real or irreconcilable contradiction with the doctrine of all-pervading oneness of brahma or with the doctrine that brahma is bliss (ānanda) or the system of theism (i. e. a personal God ). Sectarian exclusiveness and bigotry went 80 far that the Brabmanda 1599 contains a dialogue between sage Agastya and

The Viṣṇu and Padma do not stand alone in this strango story of Viṣṇu himself or through Rudra teaching false doctrines for deluding the ungodly or those that dissented from or reviled the Vedas. There were other Purāṇas that sing the same tune; for example, the Kūrma-purāpa indulges in a vendetta against many śāstras and systems in several places. A few passages are set out here. (Devi says) * the various 1601 sastras that are found in this world and are opposed to the Vedas and smrtis are based on tamas (ignorance), viz. Kapāla, Bhairava, Yamala (a class of Tantra works), Vāma (left-hand practices of a class of Tantras), Arbata (Jain doctrines ), these and others are meant for deluding (persons ); I produced these sāstras in another birth for deluding people'; 'therefore in order to protect (people) against those who were beyond the pale of the Vedas and for the destruction of sinners we shall, O Śiva, compose sastras for deluding then%B Rudra being thus advised by Madhava (Viṣṇu) composed śāstras that delude and Viṣṇu also urged on by Rudra did the same;

The Gītā (in chapter 16 ) speaks of two classes of people, viz. those born to godlike endowments and those born with demoniac qualities and describes the latter in verses 7-20. Some of the verses probably indicate that the reference is to atheists and the like; for verse 8 states they say that the world is devoid of truth

The Vayapurāña (chap. 23. 221-224 ) mentions in a prophetic voin Nakuli ( Lakoli) as the founder of a Śaiva sect and Kayārobaṇa ( modero Karavan in Dabhoi Taloka of former Baroda State ) as its sacred place ( siddha-kṣetra). The Mathurā Ins. of Candragupta II dated in Gapta era 61 (380 A, D.) in E, I. vol. XXI pp. 1 ff shows that Lakuli, the founder of the Pasopata sect, floorished about the first century A. D.

(1. o. contains nothing that one can believe ), devoid of any fixed principle (such as virtue and vice ), devoid of a Ruler, and is produced by union brought about by lust and nothing else'. After describing their thoughts and aspirations the Gita winds up these perform sacrifices which are so in name only with hypocrisy and against the prescribed procedure; they hate me in their own bodies and in those of others; these impure and cruel enemies I continually throw down in demoniac wombs; coming into demoniac wombs and being deluded, in each birth they go to vilest states without ever coming to me'. This is entirely different from what the Padma and other Purāṇas say about Pāśupatas, Pāñcarātras and about non-Vaiṣṇavas. 

Both the Bhagavata and the Padma say that 1604 (the cult of) bhakti first arose in Dravida country, it progressed or prosperad in the Karnātaka, it was found in only a few places in Maha rastra and declined in the Gurjara country; it was, on account of the terrible Kaliyuga, broken up by heresies and remained weak for a long time; but having reached Vṛndāvana ( near Mathurā ) it got a fresh start and assumed fine form. In book XI. the Bhāgavata again reverts to this assertion that in Kali people are solely devoted to Nārāyaṇa only in a few places but to the greatest extent in the Dravida country where flow the rivers Tāmraparpi, Kștamālā, Kaveri and Mahānadi flowing to the west and states that those who drink the waters of these rivers are generally devotees of Vasudeva. 

Most great moral and spiritual upheavals have a tendency to reach & very low level in course of time. That appears to have happened in the case of bhāgavatas. The Atri-smrti has & verse containing a sarcastio reference to bhāgavatas 1605 : Those who are devoid of Vedic studies learn sāstras ( such as grammar, Vedānta, logic &o.), those who are wanting in śāstrio lore become readers of Purāṇas for others; those who cannot be readers of Purāṇas become tillers; but those who are broken down even

thore, become bhāgavatas'. Atri appears to say that bhāgavatas are idlers, who do not study Veda or śāstra or who cannot even read Puranas to othera for their livelihood or do not engage in agriculture and who pretend to be worshippers (or bhaktas ) of Viṣṇu or Krspa and fatten on what is given by others that are deluded into thinking that they have forsaken everything for the sake of their love of God. They become what are called ' buwās' in Marāthi and other modern Indian languages. 

Another striking development of the bhakti cult is the Erotic Mysticism (madhurā bhakti) associated with the worship of Kṭspa and of Rādha in that form of Vaiṣṇavism established by Caitanya and Vallabhācārya. For the Vaiṣṇava movement inspired by Caitanya, vide Dr. S. K. Do's work on the Vaiṣṇava faith and movement in Bengal' (Calcutta 1942) and the author's 'History of Sanskrit Poetics' (1951) about Ujjvala nilamapi of Rūpa-gosyamin pp. 298-302. In the bhakti cult established by Vallabhācārya great importance is attached to the guru, who is one of the descendants of Vallabhācārya and to whom almost divine honours are paid. A wonderful develop mont of bhakti towards Rāma, regarded in the Rāmāyana and in popular tradition as a paragon of restraint and all manly virtues, culminated in an erotic mysticism about Rama and Sitā also. The devotees of this mystic cult have to consider themselves as brides of Rāma or the female friends of Sitā, they are supposed to seek Lord Rāma's favour through Sita, who graciously intercedes with the Lord for the devotees. Among the followers of Vallabhācārya the guru tells the devotee to look upon him the guru) as Krsna and upon himself or herself ag Rādhikā. 

For want of space further details about these bhakti culte have to be passed over. 

Supreme importance is attached to Vedic mantras and also Paurāṇika mantras. They will have to be dealt with at some length in the sections on Tantras and on Pūrvamimāngā. But some treatment of mantras, particularly vedic, may be given here as well. The word mantra occurs about twenty-five times in the Rgveda. Only once does the word mantrakt occur in the Rgveda 1606 (IX. 114, 2) 'O sage Kaśyapal offer obeisance

to king Soma Lord of plants with the chants of the composers (or authors) of mantras, thereby sending forth your own voice &o.' Mr. Kapali Sastry is inaccurate when he states (on p. 67 of the translation of his 'Rgbhāsya-bhūmikā in English) 'wo see frequent mention made in the Rik Samhita of the rishi as the author of the mantra' and he cites only Rg. IX. 114. % and I. 67. 2. The latter contains no word like mantrakst. Rg. I. 67. 2 (addressed to Agni) ning 'holding in his hand all powers (or riches), sitting in a cave (i. e. concealed) he placed the gods in fright; heroes (men or gods ) that place (offor) prayers know him (Agni) to be here when they recite mantras formed in the heart.' There is no direct reference to psis here (but to narah) and what is emphasized is that mantras already extant as the heart's outpourings enable the reciters of the mantras to find him (Agni). There is nothing to show that the mantras referred to in the verse are meant to be impromptu; the idea is rather that mantras that already existed and conveyed heartfelt devotion have to be employed to find Agni. The very next verse makes the position clear when it says, 'like the unborn (Sun) he ( Agni) supports the wide earth and fixes in its place the sky on account of the mantras that turn out true'. This clarifies two things, viz. that when this mantra (I. 67. 3) was recited there already existed a host of mantras 1607 and secondly, that the mantras that existed long before were deemed to have helped in supporting the earth and the sky. The ancient mantras were supposed to bring Indra to attend thrice in the day for a short time to the sacrifices of devotees when invoked with mantras addressed to him (Rg. III. 53. 8); similarly, mantras when recited by wise man bring Yama to receive offerings ( Rg. X. 14, 4); Rg. X. 88. 14 states we raise our voices with mantras towards Vaiśvānara Agni, who is wise and who shines brilliantly all days'. The word mantra 1608 is

also employed in the singular several times. A few striking passages are set out here. 'Indeed, God Brahmanaspati (Lord of Prayer) proclaims the mantra fit for recitation (by the mouth of the hotr ), in which the gods Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman make their abode, O Gods !'; 'We utter that very mantra ( in which Indra and other gods are praised together) in our sacrifices, the mantra being one that produces bliss and being free from all blemishes (or is incomparable ); Do place among the Gods a mantra that is not short, that is well-arranged and that is well ornamented; ancient fetters do not reach him who is in ( the good grace of) Indra by the sacrifice ( or praise ); 'I address the same mantra for you (all) and offer for you ( all) one offering (into fire)'. From these passages it appears that when these verses were recited there was a body of already existing mantras; which were supposed to be inspired by the Lord of prayers (or speech) and from which the choice of a long and well-formed one was to be made. Apart from the above passages the word mantra occurs in Rg. 1. 31. 13, 1. 74 1. 1. 147, 4, I. 152. 2, II. 35. 2, VI, 50. 14, VII. 7.6, X. 50. 4 and 6, X. 106. 11, in only one of which (Rg. II. 35.2), apart from Rg. I, 67.2 already quoted, the words 'hṣda ā sutaztam mantram'(mantra well chiselled from the heart) ara used and in another verse more simply the word 'atakṣan' (in VII. 7.6 mantram ye vāram naryā atakṣan) alone is used. In two passages (Rg. X. 95.1 and X. 191, 3 first half) the word 'mantra' appears to mean 'consultations, holding counsel together'. In Rg. I. 20.4, Rbhus are called 'satyamantrāḥ' and are said to have made their parents young. There are controversies about what the Rbbus stand for and it is difficult to say what is meant by 'satyamantrāḥ' in relation to Rbhus. Rg. VII. 76. 4. is a 1609 somewhat enigmatic verse. It means they (Aogirases) alone, (our) ancient pitṛs, learned (or wise) and following the right path, enjoyed companionship among gods and they found out the Light (the Sun) concealed (by Svarbhānu, eclipse); they, whose mantras were true, brought forth Uṣas.' In some passages where other words like sloma or brahma are used, there is 

1603. That FTATE Tara: 677: qayih: 1 T ata: foarte fara TETAPET 373 T HEN. VII. 76. 4. Angirases are spoken of de Pitps in Rg. X. 14. 6 (HETHI a: Tati 74791: ) and in Rg. V, 40. 9 Atris are said to have found out the Sun afflicted with darkness by Svarbbānu, an Asura and no one else was able to do so (de pierreur: I अत्रयस्तमन्वाविन्दन् नान्ये अशक्नुवन् ॥). This last is a reference to a total eclipse of the Sun, on the occurrence of which the Atris probably assured frightened people that the sun would shine forth in a short time. 

Other Rgveda words for prayer like brahma, stoma 

983 

mention of the stoma or brahma being made and polished by the devotee (0.g. X. 39. 14 'etam vām stomam-Aéyināvakar mātakṣāma bhrgavo na ratham'). Vide Rg. I. 62.13 for navyam ataksad brahma', Rg. V. 29.15 (Indra brahma kriyamāṇā juṣa81% saviṣtha yā te navyā akarma); brahmakstaḥ (composers of prayers or praises) are mentioned in Rg. VII. 32.2 and X. 50.7. Other words like gir (several hundred times), dhiti (about 100 times); brahma (over a hundred times) mati (about 100 times), maniṣā (over 60 times), vacas and vacasyā (over 100 times), stoma (about 200 times), sukirti (five times), sūkta (four times) are employed in the sense of thought, word or thought out hymn or verse of praise' and in several cases the sages of the Rgveda state that it is a new verse or hymn of praise that they employ. Vide 'Davyasibhir-girbhiḥ' and 'giram bhare navyasim jāya mānām' in Rg. V. 42. 13., in Rg. VI. 49. 1, VII. 53.2; Pra tavyasīm navyasim dhitimagnaye' in Rg. I. 143. 1; 'vaiśvānaraya matir-navyasi suciḥ soma iva pavato' (Rg. VI. 8. 1) and 'iyam 

to navyast matir agne adhāyyasmada' (Rg. VIII. 74. 7); iyam te agne navyasi manīgā' Rg. X. 4.6; "tā valgū 1610 Dasrā purusa katamā pratnā navyasā vacasā vivāso' ( Rg. VI. 62,5); 'Davyasi sukirtiḥ' ip Rg. I. 60.3; 'sa pratnavat navyase visvavāra sūktāya pathah krnuhi' in Rg. IX. 91. 5; 'nū navyase naviyase sūktāya sādhayā pathah' in Rg. LX. 9. 8. It is a remarkable fact that when words like 'sukirtiḥ' and 'sūkta' that occur only four or five times in the whole of the Rgveda are qualified by the word 'new or fresh', the word 'mantra' occurring so many times does not even once bear the adjective 'new'. This emphasizes the conclusion stated above that in the times of many of the extant Rgvedic versos mantras were a large group already existing, from which prayers were drawn as occasion required, though now and then new verses were added to those already existing. It may here be stated that in some places the Rgveda looks upon prayers ( dhiti) as divine and as on the same level with Asyins, Uṣas, and the Sun ( VIII. 35. 2 ) and that ancient prayers wera inherited from ancestors (III. 39.2 seyamasme sanajā pitryā dhih'). 

Several hymng and verses of the Rgveda are purely philo sophical, cosmological, mystic and speculative as I. 164, 4, 6, 29, 

1604. Here the contrast is great. The Asvins are pratnā (ancient) but the qși (in VI, 62, 5) says that he worships the ancient Dasras (Asvins) with a new prayer. This rsi at least does not convey that the Asvips were seen by him.

About the meaning and purpose of Vedic mantras there are great controversies. This much may be said here that according to the Pūryamimāṁsā system the whole Veda is concerned with sacrifices, that Veda is divided into two classes, Mantra and Brāhmana, that Vidhis (hortatory passages) are the most important part of the Veda, that a very large number of Vedic passages are mero arthavādas ( that contain either praises of vidhis or are to be explained metaphorically or merely repeat what already exists or are of a legendary character ) and that mantras only serve the purpose of bringing to the mind of the sacrificor or priests what is to be done in a sacrifice and that the words used in the mantras ordinarily bear the game meaning as that in popular Sanskrit. 

Long before Yaska ( several venturies before Christ) there were several schools of Vedic interpretation such as the Aitibāsikas ( who acc. to Nir. II. 16 said that Vitra was an Asura son of Trastr, while acc. to the Nairuktas Vrtra moans only * cloud' and the Veda contains metaphorical descriptions of battles, that the twins that Saranyu is said in Rg. X. 17. % to have given up are according to the Nairuktas Indra and the Mādhyamikā-vāk, while according to the Aitihāsikas they are Yama and Yami, as stated in Nit, XII, 10), the school of Naidānas is mentioned about 'syāla' and 'sāma' in Nir. VI 19, the school of ancient yājõikas in Nir. V. 11. Rg. I. 164. 32 (ya im cakāra ) is differently explained by the Parivrājakas ( ascetic school) and the Nairuktas ( etymologists). The Nirukta also mentions the names of seventeen individual predecessors ( from whom it differs often and who differ among themselves ) such as Āgrāyaṇa, Audumbarayana, Kautsa, Gārgya, Gālava, Sākatā yana, Sākapūṇi. There are several mantras of which two different meanings are given in the Nirukta as in Nir. V. 11 on Rg. VIII. 77.4. In Rg. I. 164 there are several verses with two meanings or more e. g. verse 21 (yatrā suparnā &c.) has two meanings (aco. to Nir. III. 13 ) one relating to the devatā Sūrya (adhidairata ) and the other spiritual ( adhyātma ); similarly, verse 32 of the same hymn has two meanings in the Nirukta (II. 8); the verse 39 (rco akṣare parame vyoman) is explained in four ways by Sāyaṇa; verse 41 ( gaurir-mimāya) is explained by Sāyaṇa in two ways, both being different from Yagka's explanation ( in Nir. 

Vārying interpretations of Roveda verses

XI, 40 ); verse 45 ( oatvāri vāk parimitā padani) is explained in six ways (more or less different from each other ) by Sāyaṇa; it is also explained in the Mahābhāṣya (p. 7 of M.M. Abhyankara. gastri's ed.). The verse' catvāri śrógā' (Rg. IV. 58. 3) has been the subject of varying explanations from very early times. Nir, (XIII, 7) explains it as referring to Yajña. The Mahābhāgya (p. 6 of the Mahābhāṣya ibid.) also does the same. Sayapa explains it as referring to Agni ( identified with yajña) and Sūrya. This verse is a riddle. Sabara 1611 in his bhāsya on P.M.S. I. 2. 38. ('abhidhāne arthavādaḥ') explains it but Kumārila differs from him. Sāyaṇa and others explain it (e. g. the word * tridhā') with reference to Mantra, Brāhmaṇa and Kalpa, but when this verse was first proclaimed there must bave been no Brāhmaṇas and Kalpasūtras. In several cases the Nirukta gives the adhidaivata (physical) and adhyātma (metaphysical or spiritual) or adhiyajña and adhyātma as in Nir. X. 26 (on Rg. X. 82.2 Viśvakarmā vimanā), Nir. XI. 4 ( on Rg. X. 85. 3, adhiyajõa and adhidaiyata meanings ), Nir. XII. 37 (on Vāj. S. 34.55 'sapta rsayah', both adhidaivata and adhyātma ), Nir. XII, 38 (On Atharva X. 8. 9 Tiryag-bilas-oamasa &o.' both adhidaivata and adhyatma). In Rg. (I. 164) verses 11-13 and 48 contain a very imaginative and poetic description of the year, the seasons, months and total days and nights. 

In recent years Sri Aurobindo in 'Hymns to the mystic Fire' (translated in the esoteric sense, 1946 ) and his ardent and devout disciple Sri. T. V. Kapali Sastry (in 'Rgbhāṣya bhūmika in Sanskrit and its English translation, Pondicherry 1952 ) have started a theory about the Rgveda mantras which must be briefly stated and examined. Śri Aurobindo first intended to publish an edition of the Rgveda with a word by word Construction and an English translation. But he gave up that idea on account of other pro-occupations and rests content in the above book with the text and translation of about 230 verses in all from the 1st, 2nd and 6th mandalas of the Rgveda and a foreword of 48 pages in which he propounds his theory. While

this was being written by the present writer, Śri Aurobindo's large work of 634 pages on the Veda' published in 1956 reached his hands. Over 60 hymns are dealt with in this big book and 283 pages are devoted to the elaboration of his theory first out lined in the brief work of Sri Aurobindo mentioned above and reiterated with greater emphasis. On page 9 of the work of 1956 he states "the ritual system recognized by Sāyaṇa may stand, the naturalistic sense discovered by European scholar sbip may, in its general conceptions be accepted, but behind there is always the true and still hidden secret of the veda - the secret words which were spoken for the purified in soul and the awakened in knowledge'. In this work also he sticks to the meaning of yta as truth and on p. 84 translates 'ptam' as 'Truth-conscious nass', when in his first work he translated 'fta-cit' as Truth-con sciousness'. Instead of comparing the several hundred passages where the word ṣta occurs in the Rgveda he sticks to his own rendering which is unacceptable to most scholars and makes a Very perfunctory attempt at finding the correct meaning. One should like to have some clear examples of the distinction between Light and Consciousness in modern times and also in the Veda. So far as the present writer knows, in the language of ancient symbolism Consciousness is identified with Light. In the recently published book he deals with legs than it th of the total hymns (1017 or 1028 ) of the Rgveda Readers are asked to subscribe to his views although he condesconds to translate in the first work less than oth of the total number of verses in the Rgveda and hardly ever enters into a discussion about the meaning of words like fta. Śri Aurobindo ( Foreword p. III) concodes that Sāyaṇa does not reject the spiritual authority of the Veda and that sāyana does not deny that there is a higher truth contained in the rks. He further says (IX) that we must take seriously the hint of Yāska (Śri Aurobindo does not quote the Nirukta. but probably he has in mind Nir. I. 20 sākṣātkrtadharmāna pgayo babhūvuḥ'). Then he proceeds to state (XVII) that many whole hymns of the Veda bear on their face a mystic meaning and that the rṣis (p. XIX) for the sake of secrecy resorted to double meaninga, a device easily manageable in the Sanskrit language. This is a hypothesis which cannot at all be accepted and is no more than more conjecture. The Vedic mantras were composed thousands of years ago, when all persons among whom the gages moved must have spoken the same language, though generally not 80 polished and poetical as that of the mantras and they were not addressed to men like the moderns whose 

Śri Aurobindo's Vedic interpretations 

9876 

every day thoughts, surroundings and languages are entirely different. Both the Master and the disciple (Mr. Kapali Sastry) cause confusion (or, may be, are themselves confused ) by sup posing that the difficulties of the modern students of mantras did exist even at or near the time of the mantras. The most sublime thought of the Rgveda is that there is only one Spirit behind the various gods, Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan, that originally there was only that One, there was no day and night, no death and immortality. Sri Aurobindo himself describes (p. XXXII) Rg. I. 164. 46 and X. 129.2 as the summit of the vedio teaching.' This view of the one Entity is also illustrated in Rg. VIII. 58. % 'one and the same Agni is kindled in many places, the one Sun enters the whole world and becomes many; the one Dawn illumines all this (physical) world, One became all this ( assumes various forms)'. No secrecy was observed about this fundamontal truth and it was proclaimed in mantras that can be understood even by an ordinary man of to-day who knows a little Sanskrit. Because we of these recent centuries cannot understand some mantras, that does not mean that the ancient seers were guilty of a subterfuge and purposely composed mantras with two meanings. They might have indulged in the pastime of two meanings (express and metaphorical) in a few cases as postic devices.1612 It is no fault of the sages, if we cannot understand their meaning, just as a blind man, who does not see a wooden post and comes to grief by dashing against it, should not blame the post, but should blame himself; we are to blame ourselves and should not foist upon the ancient sages a stratagem created by our own imagination or lack of know ledge (Nir. I. 16 ).1613 

1606. The Master ( Śri Aurobindo ) and the pupil are at variance about the poetic character of the Mantras, Śri Aurobindo (p. XXXIV) after saying that his translation is a literary and not a strictly literal one speaks of the hymns as 'great poetry', magnificent in their colourlag and images, poble and beautiful in rhythm. Now let us hear the disciple. On p. 63 Mr. Kapali Sastry states the hymnal poetry is unusual, different from other poetry, even from the most superb specimen' and then he chides the readers and men like the present author and impliedly his own Master it is not permissible (why?) to class Vedic hymns with poetry of a literary and aesthetic kłod'. On p. 31 Mr. Sastry asserts that mantras have two meanings, the inner which is psychological or spiritual and the true meaning and a gross or external meaning for common men' and he adds that the use of words with double meanings was deliberate but was sffortless and natural.

History of Dharmadāstra (Seo. V, Ch. XXIV 

Śri Aurobindo admits (p. XXXIII) that there are some key words in the Rgveda such as sta, kratu, gravas, ketu and that elabo rate work would have to be done to fix the meanings of such worde. But he does not undertake a study of the key words (each of which except 'ketu' occurs hundreds of times in the Rgveda) by comparison of Rgvedic passages and considering the light shod on these words by the other Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. He mentions the occurrence of the word ṣta in I. 164. 47 and IV. 21. 3 (sadanat-Flasya) and 'stasya pathya' in Rg. III. 12.7 and jumps to the conclusion that the last two words mean 'the path of truth' and remarks that we have to find the path of Truth' (Foreword p. XXX.). In the H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 2-5 it has been shown that șta in the Rgveda has three meanings, viz. (1) the regular and general order in the cosmos ;(2) the correct and ordered way of the cult of the gods ; (3)'moral conduct of man' In the Rgveda sta is not the same as 'satya', but the two are differentiated. In Rg. V. 51. 2 the Visve-devas 1614 are described as stadhitayaḥ (whose thoughts are fixed on ṣta) and 'satyadharmāṇaḥ' (whose ordinances are true or fixed) and the sage prays to them to come to his sacrifice and to drink (ajya and soma) by the tongue of Agni. In Rg. X 190. 1 both sta and satya are said to have arisen from rigorous or refulgent tapas (of the Creator). In the Rgveda sta involved a very wide conception as stated above and 'satya' had a restricted moaning viz. truth or static order. In Rg. IX, 113. 4 Soma is described as one who proclaims sta, satya and średdhā (faith). Therefore, Sri. Aurobindo is quite inaccurate when he translatos ṣta by the word Truth' and draws important conclusions from his inaccurate renderings. Similarly, Sri. Aurobindo does not give a correct rendering when he translates (Foreword p. XXX) the word stacit' as truth-conscious ( whatever that may mean sco. to Sri. Aurobindo). Mr. Kapali Sastry (p. 46 ) goes & step further than his great master by stating that in the mantras true know ledge is termed stacit' Truth--consciousness ( with a capital C). It appears that both Master and disciple are misled by the meaning of 'cit' in such an attribute as sat-cit-ananda', applied to brahma. They appear to take ta-cit' as meaning two distinct things yta' and 'cit'. The word 'rtacit' occurs

five times in the Rg.; in 1615 I. 145.5, IV. 3.4, V, 3.9(*ftacit is here an epithet of Agni), in VII 85.4 (it is an adjective of hots) and in IV. 16. 10 it qualifies the word nārī ( in the context, Saci, the wife of Indra). The present author wonders whether Sri Aurobindo and his disciple cared to go into the meaning of *ptacit' in the several verses where it occurs. They pay no attention to the word 'ļṇacit' that occurs in Rg. II, 23. 17 as an attribute of Brahmanaspati. 1616. 

The space at the author's disposal does not allow him to abow up the other unwarranted propositions and conclusions of Śri Aurobindo and Mr. Kapali Sastry. The author will set out the final conclusion of Sri. Aurobindo (Foreword p. XXIX) "what then is the secret meaning, the esoteric sense which emerges by this way of understanding the Veda ? ......... The thought around which all is centred is the seeking after Truth, Light, Immortality. There is a truth deeper and higher than the truth of outward existence, a Light greater and higher than the light of human understanding which comes by: revelation and inspiration, an immortality towards which the soul has to rise. We have to find our way to that, to get into touch with this Truth and Immortality." This is a grand peroration, but all this is built on shaky and meagre foundations, such as the wrong mean ings attached to the words ṣta and ștaoit. Mr. Kapali Sastry ( on p. 46 ) practically reproduces this grand summing up of his guru. 

Mr. Kapali Sastry launches (on pp. 22–26 ) a bitter diatribe against Sāyaṇa but ultimately he has to admit (pp. 27–28 ) that Sāyaṇa is not merely useful, but indispensable to the students of the Veda. On p. 23 he translates a sūtra from Jaimini's work the purpose of the Veda being ritualistic, words which do not have that significance are useless' and remarks that this clearly lays down that the only purpose of the Vedas is that of ritual, those that do not pertain to that (ritualistic action) are worthless. The author doubts whether Mr. Kapali Sastry has carefully read the Purvamimānsāsūtras or has at least

Correctly stated the position; what he quotes is the Pūrvapakṣa view ( prima facie view). Jaimini's position is contained in the 7th sūtra 1617 as those passages (that do not directly concern themselves with ritualistic actions ) form one syntactically connected whole with the passages prescribing ridhis they are to be considered as commendatory of the vidhis'. Mr. Sastry is not satisfied with saying (on p. 8) the sages Madhucchandas and others are seers of the mantra, the Gods were present to the vision of these seers of old', but he adds 'this seer of the beyond is alao the hearer of the truth; therefore that the poet-geors are truth-hearers kavayah satyaśı utah, is famous in the Veda' (p. 64). The present writer wonders whether Mr. Sastry carefully read the original passages where the words kayayaḥ satyaśrutaḥ'occur in the Veda. The words kaziḥ and karayaḥ occur several hundred times in the Rgveda, but 'satyaśrutaḥ' occurs only thrice in Rg. V. 57. 8, V. 58.8 and VI. 49.6; Rg. V. 57, 8 and V.58. 8 are identical. In Rg. V.57. 8 and 1617a V. 58. 8 it is the wind-gods (Maruts) that are addressed as kavayah (wise) and salyaśrutah (well-known as conferring true rewards) and not sages. VI. 49.6 (first half of which is addressed to Parjanya and Vāta-wind god) runs 'O esta blishers of the world! (O Maruts !) that are wise and well-known as conferring true rewards, make the world turn towards the man by whose lauds you are praised' (this half seems to be addressed to the band of Maruts). Further comment is superfluous. 1618

1612. The present author is aware that thousands of people look upon Sri Aurobindo as a yogin, a prophet and as a World Teacher. But the search for truth is higher than all propbets and yogios put togetber. Sri Aurobindo and his disciple claim that he has received a new revelation about the Veda beyond the ken of all scholars of antiquity and modern times and they have very severely haadled Yaska, Jaimini, Sāyaṇa and other commentators. The devotees and admirers of Sri Aurobindo must allow the same freedom to the critics of Sri Aurobindo's Vedic lacubrations for showing how and why they are wrong and are requested not to take umbrage at what tbo present writer bas said about his theories but only to reply to the aathor's brief criticismo on their merits or demerits, 

Mimūnsd generalisation as to Veda 

991 

The Mimānsakas made & sweeping generalisation that the whole Veda is meant for sacrifice. They went rather too far but they had substantial grounds for doing so. On pp. 980–982 of the H. of Dh. vol. II, it has been shown how even the Rgveda discloses that a complicated system of sacrifices with three savanas, numerous priests, three fires, existed in those far-off days and sacrifices like Atirātra (Rg. VII. 103.7) and Trikadruka (Rg. I. 32.3, II. 11. 17, VIII, 13, 18, VIII, 92. 21, X 14, 16) were being performed. The Mīmānsakas bad a long tradition behind them. But the case of Sri Aurobindo's theories is entirely different. On flimsy grounds and mistaken meanings he builds up an imposing structure of an exoteric and also an esoteric meaning of vedic mantras, propounds that the sages wanted secrecy for their doctrines and all that they were concerned with was Truth, Light and Conscious1888. It has been already shown that there are several philosophical and speculative hymns in the Rgveda, But there is no motive of secrecy therein. If it is only Truth, Light and Consciousness with which the vedio sages were concerned ten thousand verses would not have been necessary. One should like to know what secret or higher or deeper esoteric Truth or Light or Consciousness to be kept concealed from common men is contained in hymns such as Rg. VII. 55 ( sleeping charm), VII. 103 (maṇdāka-stuti), X. 34 (gambler's song), X. 119 (exhilaration of power of Soma od Indra), X 166 (invoking destruction of enemies), X. 190 (brief creation hymn), X. 191 (for concord and co-operation). Many more such hymns may be cited, where the theory of secrecy and Truth, Light and Consciousness would entirely fail. Besides, what is the secret (or spiritual or esoteric) element in such passages as those quoted above viz. I. 164. 46, X. 129.%, VIII. 58.2, which clearly express the most profound Truth. If the Mimāýsakas made a too wide generalization, Sri Aurobindo makes a far wider generalization with yory little basis. 

The mantras of the Rgveda have a meaning and are not unmoaning letters as often in Tantrik works. There is a discus sion in Nirukta I 15–16 where it is said that in the absence of the Nirukta the apprehension of the meaning of the words used in mantras would not follow and the view of Kautsa is cited that the Nirukta is useless for understanding the meaning of mantras, since the mantras themselves have no sense (or are uselogs or purposeless ). Yāska 1618 replies that mantras do possess

a meaning since they employ the very same words that are used in ordinary Sanskrit, and then quotes a passage of the Ait. Br. (1. 5). Sabara on Jai. I. 2. 41 states that where one cannot get at the meaning one has to come to some meaning on a con. sideration of other Vedic passages and on the basis of roots following Nirukta and Grammar. 

One of the important topios dwelt upon at length in the Purāṇas is that of avatāras. This emphasis on the conception of avatāras has greatly influenced the forms of religious worship, vratas and festivals. The subject of avatāras has been dealt with in the H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 717-724. It has been shown there that the beginnings of the doctrine of avatāras and of some of the well-known avatāras may be traced to the Vedic Literature viz. to the Satapatha-Brāhmana (story of Manu and the fish in I. 8. 1. 1-6), story of Kurma (tortoise ) in Satapatha VII. 5. 1. 5, of Varāha (Boar) in Sat. Br. XIV. 1.2, 11, Vamana (Dwarf) in Sat. Br. I. 2. 5. 1 ff., Krspa, son of Devaki, in Chān. Up. II, 17. 6 and that the number of avatāras and the Dames also varied. But the treatment was not exhaustive and hence some details are added here from the Purāpas and from general considerations. 

Avatāra (from root tṛ. with 'ava') means descending or descent' and the word is applied to gods, assuming the form of a human being or even of an animal and continuing to live in that form till the purpose for which that form was assumed was carried out. Reincarnation is one of the fundamental dootrines of Christianity. But there is a vast difference between that doctrine and the Hindu theory. Re-incarnation in Chris tianity is single and unique, while in the Hindu theory 28 adumbrated in the Gita (IV.5-8) and the Purāṇas there have been many incarnations of the Deity and there may he many more in future. It is a comforting belief for ordinary mon to hold that when the affairs of the world are in a mess God comes down to the earth to set matters right. And this belief is held not only by the Hindus and Buddhists but by many peoples (including some in the rich and educated West) far apart from each other. Most Hindus, however, do not believe that great

men, saints or prophets like Saṅkarācārya, Nānak, Shivaji or Mahatma Gandhi are born again as avatāras in times of crisis. The Buddhists made Buddha in their Mahāyāna teachings go through many avatāras as bodhisattva before he attained Buddha hood. In modern times many persons pose or are made to pose as avatāras by their admirers or followers. Recently, Mr. J. G. Bennett (Hodder and Stoughton, 1958) has published a book called "Subud' (Sushila, Buddha, Dharma) in which he suggests his firm belief that one Pak Subuh who hails from Indonesia is an avatar, the messenger from above for whom mankind is waiting. The Indian theory of avatāras is connected with the theory about yugas and manyantaras. When the world is in gerious troubles people believe that deliverance will come by the grace of God and they are often justified in their belief by the appearance of godly. men who appear with some noble mission and masterly idea suited to the particular time and place when they appear, 

In medieval and modern times the avatāras of Viṣṇu have been regarded as ten, viz. Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Nșsimha or Narasimha (Man-lion), Vāmana, Paraśurāma, Rama (son of Dasaratha), Krṣṇa, Buddha and Kalkin. The Varāha-purāṇa mentions these ton in that order.1619) In an inscription on the lintel above the figure of Śhaṅkara-Nārāyana in the Varāba Perumal 1620 temple, thia Paurāṇik verse except the first six letters (which cannot be read) is seen inscribed. The locus classicus about the descent of God in different formas is in the Bhagavad gita 1621 viz. 'Whenever piety or righteousness (dharma)

The game idea occurs in some of the parvans of the Mahābhārata, as in Vanaparva 272.71 and Aśramedhika-parva 54. 13. None of the ten avatāras, except those of Krṣṇa and probably Rama, ("Rāmaḥ sastrabhṛtām-ahaun', Gitā X. 31 ) are, however, men. tioned by Dame in the Bhagavad-gitā. The number and names of the avatāras are not uniform in the Mahābhārata. In the Nārdyapiya section of the Santiparva (chap. 339. verses 77-102) only six avatāras and their exploits are expressly mentioned, viz, Varāha (bringing up the earth submerged in the ocean), Narasimha (killing demon Hiraṇyakasipu ), Vāmana (van quishing Bali and making him dwell in Patāla), Bhargava Rama ( extirpating ksatriyas), Rāma, son of Dasaratha (killing Ravaṇa), Krṣṇa ( killing or vanquishing Kamsa, Narakasura, Bapa, Kalayavana, Jarāsandha, Siśupāla). Then the same chapter 1622 mentions ton avatāras as follows: Hamsa, Kūrma, Matsya, Varāha, Narasimha, Vamana, Rāma (Bhargava), Rāma Dasarathi, Sātvata, Kalki. Here Buddha is omitted and Kṭspa is called Sātvata and Hamsa is added. In the Harivarsa 1623 it is said that the past avatāras have been thousands and in future also they would be thousands. Santiparva says the same thing. The Harivamsa (I. 41. 27 ff) Dames only the following and their exploits, viz. Varāba, Narasimha, Vāmana, Dattatreya, Jāmadagnya (Parasurama), Rāma, Kroṇa and Vedavyasa, But as Kośava is said to be the 9th (I. 41.6) it is to be under stood that Matsya and Kūrma were counted, though not expressly named and Kalki Viṣpuyabas is mentioned as a

futuro avatara. The usual ton avatāras are named in Vardha 1634 (4. %, 48. 17-22, 55. 36-37), Mataya' 285. 6-7, Agni (ohap. 2-16 stories about all ton), Narasimhapurdna (chap. 36), Padma VI. 43. 13-15). In Vayu 98. 68-104 the text presents the avatāras in a confused manner and appears to mention ton avatāras, viz. Varāha, Narasimha, Vāmana, Dattatreya, Māndhātę, Jāmadagnya, Rama ( Dasarathi), Veda-vyāsa, Vasu deva, Kalkin Vispuyaśas. In Brahminda III. 73.75 \# thote are lists of avatāras different from the present ten. In the Bhagavata the avatāras of Viṣṇu are mentioned in several places. In I. 3. 1-25 twenty-two avatāras including Brahma, Dovarṣi Nārada (who promulgated the Satvata system), Nara Nārāyana, Kapila ( who taught to Asuri the Saṅkhya system ), Dattatreya, Rsabha, (son of Nabhi and Merudeyi),1625 Dhanvan tari, Mohini, Vedavyāga, Balarāma and Kṛspa, Buddha, Kalki are mentioned. In II. 7 twenty-three avatāras are mentioned, many of which are the same as in I. 3, but in II. 7 Dhruva, Pythu son of Vena, Hayagriva are mentioned, the first two of which are mentioned as avatāras hardly anywhere else. In Bhāgavata XI, 40. 17-22 the following avatāras are mentioned, viz. Matsya, Hayasirsa, Kūrma, Sūkara, Narasimha, Vāmana, Bhargava Rāma, Rāma, Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Buddha, Kalki. In Bhagavata XL 4. 17-22 sixteen avatāras are set out, viz. usual ten plus Hamsa, Datta (Dattātreya), Kumāra (Nārada), Reabha, Vyāsa and Hayagriva. Twelve avatāras are noted in Matsya 99. 14 and Padma V. 13. 182-186. The Prapancasāratantra (ascribed to the great advaita teacher Saṅkarācārya) mentions ( in Patala 20. 59 ) Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Nșsimha, Kubja (i. e. Vamana), three Ramas 

1624. The passage of Matsya ( 285. 6–7) is very likely a later loter polation, because in another place in the Matsya, the names of avatāras are different. In Mataya 47. 106 there is a reference to the curse on Viggo by Bhrga that since Viṣgu kūled his wife he would have to be bora seven times as a human being and the seven avatāras are Dattatreya, Māndbāta, Jāmadagoya (Bhargava) Rama, Rāma Dāśarathi, Vedavyāsa, Baddba, Kalkio and three more (io 47, 237--240 ), viz. Nārāyaga, Narasimha and Vimana are added: 1o Matsya 54. 15-19, Nakgatrapuruṣa-vrata is described and the usual ten avatāras are named, 

1625. Rṣabba, son of Nābhi, appears to be the first tirthankars of the Jainas and was probably raised to the status of an incarnation of Visgu as Buddha was raised. In I. 3. 24 G is referred to as follows : : कलो समवृत्ते संमोहाय अरविवार दो नाम्नाऽजनत: कीकवेषु भविष्यति। नमो पदाप grerear uangHirtaa X. 40.22.

(i.e. Bhārgavarama, Dāśarathi Rama and Balarama), Krona and Kalkin (i. e. it omits Buddha). The Ahirbudhnya Samhita (5. 50-57) enumerates 39 avatāras of Vasudeva, that are set out by Otto Schrader in his Introduction to the Panoarātra and the Ahirbudhnya Samhita, pp. 42-43. The Viṣṇupurāṇa 1626 states that Lakṣmi follows Viṣṇu in his avatāras. The Purāṇas are full of the descriptions of the exploits of Viṣṇu in his several avatāras. But it should not be supposed that Śiva had no ayatāras. The Vāyu (chap. 23) mentions 28 avatārag of Maheśvara the last of which was Nakuli (Lakuli) as verse 221 gays. In Varāha 15. 10-19 all avatāras are praised except that of Buddha. But Varāba ( 48, 20-22) provides that worship of Narasimha frees men from the fear of sins, of Vamana leads to removal of delusion, of Parasurama to wealth, one should worship Dāśarathi Rama for the destruction of cruel enemies, one desirous of a son should worship Balarama and Kșsna, one who desires a handsome form should worship Buddha and one should worship Kalkin for the slaughter of enemies 1627 The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 49. 1-9) describes what characteristics the images of the ten avatāras should possess and says that the image of Buddha should be represented as having a quiet face, long ear-lobes, fair complexion, wearing an upper garment, seated in Padmāsana posture and his hands should have the varada and abhaya poses. 

From the facts that Kṣemendra in his Dasavatāra-carita 1628 (composed in 1066 A, D.), and the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva (court poet of Laksmanasena) mention the ugual ton avatāras with Fish as the first and that the Matsya passage about ten avatāras is quoted by Aparārka (first half of 12th century), it follows that all the ten avatāras of Viṣṇu had become recognised throughout India at least about the 10th century A. D.

Avatāras in Purāṇas and Inscriptions &c.

Kumārila (7th century A. D.) did not accept Buddha as an avatāra, though about that contury some people had come to recognize him as such (vide note 1629). Besides, as shown above, there were many views about the total number of avatāras, their names and the order in which they appeared. Vide Dr. Katre's paper in Allahabad University Studies, vol. X. pp. 37–130 for discussion on 33 avatāras. The Varāba avatāra is mentioned in the Eran stone Boar 1629 Inscription of Toramāṇa (Gupta inscriptions pp. 158-160) in the first quarter of the 6th century. The Raghuvansa (IV. 53 and 58 ) refers to the recovery of land near the Sahya mountain from the Western Sea by Rāma (Bhargava); vide pp. 89-90 and note 224 above for references in the Mahabharata and Purāpas to Paraśurāma's exploits. The Sarvānukramani p. 42 on Rg. X, 110 names as ļṣi Jamadagni or his son Rāma The Meghadūta mentions the planting of the left foot of Viṣṇu on Bali (i.e. the Vamana avatāra). Māgha in Sisupala-vadha (XV. 58) regards Bodhisattva (Buddha) as an avatāra of Hari and as sought to be tempted by the hordes of Māra. Māgha 1630 flourished about 725-775 A. D. The know ledge of Vamana and Krsna avatāras can be carried back centuries before the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali, since it refers to works and dramatic representations of the imprisonment of Bali and the killing of Kamsa (vide pp. 130, 203 and notes 330, 521 above). In the Daśāvatāra cave at Ellora one sees the repre sentations of Varāha, Narasimha, Vāmana and Krsna. Those caves are ascribed to the 8th century A. D.1631 Therefore, it appears almost certain that some at least ( viz. Vamana, Parasu rāma and Krsna) of the usual ton avatāras had been recognised some centuries before Christ and all ten had come to be recognised by some writers and other people before the 7th century A. D.

(Sec. V, Oh, XXIV 

The conception of avatāras contributed largely to the increase of Dharmaśāstra material. They gave rise to numerous vratas and festivals. For example, the Varāhapurāpa devotes chaptera 39-48 to dvādaśi-vratas in honour of the ton avatāras from Matsya to Kalkin. There are separate festivals called Jayantis of the avatāras such as Narasimha-jayanti on Vaisakha śu. 14, Paraśurāma jayanti ( on Vaiśākha su. 3). Vide pp. 262 263 for the tithis and months in which the different avatāras appeared. 16316 

Descriptions of each of the ten well-known avatūras occur in several Purāṇas; for example, Matsya avatāra is described in Matsya chap. 1-2, Agni 2, Narasimua 37; Kūrma in Agni 3, Bhāgavata I. 3. 16, VIII. 7-8-10, Narasimha 38; Varāba in Matsya 247-248, Vāyu 6. 11–26, Bhāgavata III. 13. 18-45, III. 19. 25-30, Narasimha 39; Narasimha avatara in Brahma 58. 12 ff., 213.43 ff., Matsya 161-163, Bhāgavata I. 3. 18, VII. 8. 18, Narasimha-purāṇa 41-44; Vimana in Brahma 73 and 213. 80-185, Vāgu 98, 74-87, Vāmanapurāṇa 78.51, Bhagavata VIII. 18. 12 to VIII, 22. 33, Narasimla 45; Parasurama in Matsya 244–246, Bhagavata IX, 15. 13, IX, 16. 1-26 and vide above pp. 89-90 and note 204; Rāma in Brahma 176, Agni 5-11 (the seven kāndas of the Rāmāyaṇa are summarised), Vāyu 88. 183 198, Bhag. IX. 10-11, Padma IV.1-68, Narasiinha 47-52; Krsna in Brahma 14-17, 180-21%, Agni 12-15, Bhāg. X. 3, 44-45, 50 52 &c., XL 1 and 30, Narasimha 53; Buddha in Brahma 180. 27-39, Agni 16, 1-3, Varāba 180. 27–29, 213, 32 ff., Padma VI. 31. 13-15, Bhag. I 3.24; Kalkin - Vide H. of Dh, III. pp. 923 925 for references. The avatāras and their jayantis are described in many Dharmaśāstra works, but the ļodarānanda, vol. I. edited by Dr. P. L. Vaidya in the Ganga Oriental Series probably contains the longest account of the ton avatāras (pp. 39-386 ). Thousands of verses are devoted by the Purāṇas to each of the topics of dāna ( gifts), sraddha, tirtha and vrata and they have been quoted at longth by works on Dharmaśāstra. It would be 

1631 a. The following verse is cited from the curreain fa. Ph. p. 81 : मत्योऽभूद्धतमुग्दिने मधुसिते, कूमो विधी माधवे, वाराहो गिरिजाइते नभसि, यमते सिते माधवे। सिंहो, भाद्रपदे सिते इरितिधौ श्रीवामनी, माधवे रामो गौरितिधावतः परमपूर रामो नवम्यां मधोः ॥ कृष्णोष्टम्यां नभसि सितपरे, चाश्चिने यहशम्यां वृद्धः, कल्की नभसि समभूषष्ठवां क्रमेण ।. The भक्तिप्रकाश p. 79 (of the वीरमिनोदय) also quotes this. The A.FA. remarks that others cite some stray verses where some of the tithis are differeot and that some Koikana writers cite some verses as occurring in a regem in which

best to bring together by way of illustration a few of the pages of the previous volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra on these subjects. 

Vide vol. II. pp. 880-881 (for gifts of certain dānas called dhenus from Matsya chap. 82, Varāha, chap. 99-110, Agni, chap. 210), p. 882 (for gifts called parvata or meru from Matsya 83-92, Agni 210 quoted by Aparārka pp. 344-454), pp. 884-885 (for grahaśānti from Matsya 93 and about images of planets from Matsya 84 ), p. 892 ( for dedication of a reservoir of water to the public from Matsya 58), pp. 895–896 for the planting of trees and the dedication of a garden to the public ( Matsya 59, Agni 70), pp. 896-899 (for dedication of temples and consecration of images in Matsya 264–266, Agni 60 and 66); vol. IV. pp. 162–164 about various hells (Agni 203, 371, Brahma 22, 214-215, Brahmavaivarta, Prakrtikhanda 29 and 33, Nāradapurāṇa I. 15, Padma IV, 227, Bhaviṣya, Brāhmaparva 192, Bhāgayata V. 26, Viṣṇu V. 6, Mārkandeya 12 and 14); vol. IV. p. 170 about heaven being really happiness of the mind (Brahma 22. 44 and 47, Viṣṇu IV. 6. 46); VOL IV. pp. 177–178 on the doctrine of Karmevipāka ( Vāmana 12, Mārkandeya 15, Varāha 203, Viṣṇu dharmottara II. 102); vol.

It is unnecessary to refer to the pages of this volume itself for numerous references to Purāṇas as regards tithis, various vratas, times for religious rites, astrological matters &o. 

It should not be supposed that the Purāṇas are restricted to topios called religious in popular parlance and to the five charac teristio topics of creation, re-creation ( sarga, pratisarga &c.) Some of the Purāṇas contain an exhaustive treatment of the duties of kings, ministers, commander-in-chief, judge, envoy scribes, court physioian and of coronation, invasion &o 

1000 



(Sec. V, OL. XXIV 

Many of these matters have already been dealt with in vol. III. of the H. of Dh. The most exhaustive treatment of what may be called political matters is found in Matsya chap. 215-226 and 240, Agni 218–242, Viṣṇudharmottara II. chap. 2-7, 18-21, 24-26, 28, 61-63, 66–72, 145–152, 177. Among other Purāṇas Garuḍa I. 108-115, Mārkandeya 24 (in Venk. od, or 27 in Bagerji's ed.), Kālikā 87 contain some discussion of matters political. It should be noticed that both Matsya ( 240.2) and Agni (228.1) employ the two technical words, 'Akranda' and 'Pārspigrāha' that are part of the theory of Mandala in Kautilya (VI. 2. p. 260) explained in H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 222. The Matsyapurāṇa is profusely quoted by one of the earliest extant digests on Dharmaśāstra viz. the Kṛty& kalpataru on Rājadharma (pp. 23, 25-30, 34-38, 42–43, 55-61, 118-122, 123–124, 158-161 and many verses from chap. 227 and 241 of the Matsya on the administration of justice in Vyavahāra kānda pp. 342, 345, 348, 377, 406, 409-10, 562, 581, 594-95, 599). The same digest quotes many verses (pp. 9–13, 128, 166, 178-181) from the Brahmapurāṇa which are not found in the printed Brahma (Ādan, ed.), but which are quoted by the Rājanīti. prakāśa of Mitramiśra (borrowing from Kr̥tyakalpataru) pp. 138, 158, 283, 416-419 and some by the Rājadharmakaustubha of Anantadova (pp. 326–330). The Viṣṇudharmottara on rājadharma is not quoted in the Kṛtyakalpataru on rajadharma, but it is frequently quoted by the Rājanītiprakāśa e. g. Vi. Dh. II. 18.1, 5-14 are quoted by R. N. P. on pp. 32-33, Vi. Dh. II. 18. 2-4 are quoted by R. N. P. p. 61, Vi. Dh. II, 22. 1-185 are quoted by R. N. P. pp. 66-81 (on mantras to be recited and the several divinities to be invoked at a king's coronation), Vi, Dh. II. 23. 1-13 are quoted by R. N. P. on pp. 82-83 (describing the towards of the mantras recited in Vi. Dh. II. 22). Vi. Dh. is quoted 21 times by the Rajadharma-kaustubha. These three Purāṇas alone (Mataya, Agni, Viṣoudharmottara ) devote several thousand verses to the topic of rāja-dharma and allied matters. The Garuḍa-purāṇa (I. 108-115) devotes about four hundred yerges to Rājansti (political thought) but many of them are like subhāṣitas (bon mots) and are borrowed from Manu (e. g. Garuḍa I. 109. 1 and 52, 110.7, 115 63 are respectively Manu VII, 213, VIII. 26, II, 239, IX. 3), the Mahābhārata, the Nāradasmrti (e. g. 'na sā sabhā' in Garuḍa 115.52 is Nārada III. 18), The Garuḍa itself states that it will expound the essence of niti (Rajadharma) based upon Artham

Certain verses from the Mārkandeya-purāṇa (24. 5, 23-33 or chap. 27 and 21-31 in Banerji's ed.) are quoted by R. N. P. pp. 30-31 ( about the duties of kings and their acting in the peculiar ways of five gods, viz. Indra, Sūrya, Yama, Soma and Vāyu). The Dāyabhāga quotes the Markandeya-purāṇa for pointing out that sāpindya in the matter of inheritance and succession is different from sāpiṇdya for the periods of aśauca ( impurity on death 1634). The Kṛtyakalpataru on Rājadharma (pp. 182-183 ) quotes a passage from Skandapurāṇa on the festival of Kaumudimahotsava to be celebrated by the king. 

The same passage is quoted by R. N. P. pp. 419-421. 

The Kr̥tyakalpataru (on Rāja dharma) quotes a long passage (pp. 201-212) from Bhaviṣyapurāṇa on. Vasordhārā', which is quoted by the R.N.P. (pp. 447-457 ) from the Devipurāṇa. The Kālikāpurāpa in chapter 87 dovotos 131 verses to Rājaniti, in which a summary is furnished of the course of conduct that should be followed by the king. This chapter expressly mentions the works of Uśanas and Bphaspati (verses 99 and 130) and advises the king to honour brāhmaṇas that are advanced in knowledge, learning, tapas and age, to control his senses, to employ the four upāyas ( sāma, dāna, danda and bheda ), to avoid the vices of gambling, drinking, indulgence in sexual matters and hunting, to practise the six guṇas ( yāna, āsana &c. ), to test the princes, councillors, the queens and other female relatives by upadhās ( investigation of character by various trioks) 1635

History of Dharmasāstra (Sec. V, Oh. XXIV 

. It appears that Kautilya's Arthaśāstra was not available to most medieval writers and therefore they relied on the purāṇas for the treatment of Rajadharma. But the early Puranas like the Matsya appear to have made use of Kautilya's work. Vide the author's paper on 'Kautilya and the Matsya-purāṇa' in Dr. B. C. Law presentation volume II. pp. 13-15. 

In the matter of the administration of justice and the law of SUCCession and inheritance also some of the Purāṇas have influenced the views of writers of nibandhas. The Kr̥tya kalpataru on Vyavahāra quotes about twelve verses from the Kālikā-purāṇa on the marks of a truthful party or witness and on the appropriate ordeals in the case of the several varṇas, 1636 their procedure and the different causes of action (vide pp. 79, 205, 210, 211, 221, 231, 238). Three verses from the Kālikā (chap. 91. 35-37) about the twelve kinds of sons and the impro priety of making a punarbhava, svayandatta and a dāsa successor to a kingdom are quoted in the R. N. P. pp. 35 and 42. Verges 38-41 of Kālikā, chapter 91, about the sons that can be adopted and the age up to which they can be adopted are quoted by the Dattakamimamsā p. 60 ( Ānan. ed.) and by the Vyava haramayūkba p. 114, though the latter remarks that they were not found in two or three mss. of the Purāṇa, 1637 In connection with the question of the seniority among twing the Mayakha quotes Sridhara's comment on Bhāgavata (III. 19. 18) that the son born first is the younger one; but the Vyavahāramayūkha1638 makes the interesting remark that in the Purāṇas practices opposed to the smrtis are frequently soon.
