CHAPTER XXIII 

Brief Notes on individual Purāṇas and Upapurāṇas 

Agnipurāṇa- Present Agni' (by H.) in L. H. Q. vol Xi pp. 683-691: 'Studies in genuine Agneya alias Vahnipurāṇa' by H. in Our Heritage' vol. I part 2 pp. 209–245 and vol. II part 1 pp. 76-109; 'Discovery of genuine Āgneyapurāṇa ' by E. in J. O. L (Baroda ) vol. V (1956) pp. 411-416 ( shows that present Agni published by Anan. Press is not the original Purana, that this was compiled late, while the original Agneya or Vahni is not yet printed ); the Dānasāgara p. 7. verse 63 speaks of an Āgneya which it has discarded apart from one which it has utilized (p. % Vorso 11 ). As usual with most Purāṇas, the printed Agneya glorifies itself by saying (in chap. 272. 13 and 17 ) that in that Mahāpurāṇa Hari resides in the form of diffe rent lores and the Agneya is a great purāṇa full of Veda and all vidyās. 

Adipurāṇa (U.)-B. V. VOL VI (1945 ) pp. 60-73 (H. posta lates an earlier and a later version ). Vāyu 104.7 mentions an Adika among the 18 prinoipal purāṇas (including the Brahma). Alberuni's list (which mixes up Purāṇas and Upapurāṇas ) mentions an Adipurāpa; an Adipurāṇa is published by the Venk. Preas in 29 chapters. H. in Studies &c.' vol. I pp. 279-303 deals at longth with this and tries to establish that there was an earlier Adi Purāṇa of which no msg. are yet available (p. 211) and holds that it is to be dated between 1203 to 1525 AD. ('Studies' p. 288 ). Adi and Adya mean the same thing. But Kullūka on Manu II. 54 quotes some verses from Adi which are asoribed to Brihma by G, R. p. 314. The digests make a con fusion between Adi and Adityapurāṇa. Vide H. in 'Studies' vol I. pp. 302–303. The printed one is a late compilation and none of the verses quoted by Lakṣmidhara and Apararka occur therein (vide' Studies' vol. I pp. 286–289). 

Adityapurūna-Mentioned by Matsya 53.62 as U. and Al beruni ( Sachau I. p. 130, 229, 248 ); quoted by Krbyakalpataru on Rājadharma (about 2 verses ), Dāna (about 125 ), Sraddha (about 20), Vrata (about 22 ); the Sm. O. quotes many verses on Ahnika and Śrāddba from both Adi and Aditya and quotes both

separately on sauca' on the game page (I p. 94). Aparārka also quotes many verses from both Adi and Aditya. The Dana sāgara quotes about forty verses from both the Adi and Aditya purāṇas. 

Ekāmra. ( a work of Orissa ) :-H in P. O. vol. 16 pp. 70-76 and 'Studies &c.' vol. I. p. 341 (assigns it to 10th or 11th contury A. D.) 

Kalikū:-(an U. in 93 chapters pr. by Vank, Prosa, Bombay ); vide H. in A.B.O.R.I. vol. XXII. pp. 1-23; Sharma in I. H. Q. vol. 23 pp. 322-326 (holding that Kalika was completed during the reign of king Dharmapāla of Kāmarūpa ); H. in B.V. vol. 16 (1956) pp. 35-40 questions the view of Sharma; Dato of Kālikā' by Prof. Gode in J.O.R. (Madras) vol. X. pp. 289-294; Dr. Raghavan in J.O.R. (Madras) vol. XII. pp. 331–360 (shows that there are three separate recensions of the Purana). H. distinguishes between an earlier version and the extant one and places the latter in the 10th or 11th century; on the words of Matsya 53. 60-64 'tad-etebhyo vinirgatam', the Kalpataru explains 'vinirgatam' as 'udbhūtam' (sprung from ) and gives the Kālikā as an illustration (Brahmacāri p. 30) of an Up& purāṇa sprung from Mahāpurāṇas; the Kalpataru quotes from it about 100 verses on vrata, on dāda, 14 on gshastha, 1% on vyavahāra (about witnesses and ordeals), 5 each on niyatakāla and tirtha and 2 on brahmacārin; Aparārka quotes it on pp. 15, 226, 377 (15 versos on marriage and house settlements for brāhmaṇas), 924; the Sm. C. IL p. 442 quotes one verse from it on śrāddha. The Dānasāgara quotes many verses from it. The Venk. ed. montions Viṣṇudharmottara in chap. 91. 70 and 92. 214145; the extant Kalikā would have to be placed before 1000 A. D. Vide p. 809 n 1317 above for the Kālikā saying that the howl of a female jackal is auspicious. 

Kalkipurāṇa --Vide H. in Studies &c.' vol I. pp. 303-303. There are three editions, all from Calcutta; H. remarks that it is a lato work not quoted by any writer (P. 308) and that it is not to be placed later than the 18th century A. D. 

Kurma-(VeokPress ed.); is divided into Purvārdha (53 chapters) and Uttarardha ( 46 chapters); vide H, in 'Purāṇas

XI, pp. 265–286 and P.R.E.R. pp. 57-75; H. holds that it was originally a Papoarātra work, but was altered to make it a Pāśupata one. In several passages the Kurma speaks of God as one (II. 11. 112-115), but divided into two, Nārāyana and Brabmā (in I. 9. 40) or as Viṣṇu and Śiva (in I. 2. 95) or in three (as in I. 10,77). The Sm. C. I, p. 199 quotes verses from I, 2. 94, 95, 97-99 which allow & person to worship either Viṣou with the mantra (Rg. I. 22. 20 or X. 90) or śiva with Rudragāyatri, Rudras (Tai. 8. IV, 5.1-11) or 

Tryambakam' (Rg. VII. 59. 12, Tai. 8. I. 8. 6. 2.) or with 'Om namah Sivāya'. The 8m. C. quotes from Kūrma about 94 verses on āhnika and 19 on śrāddha. In I. 1. 21-22 it states that there were four samhitās of the Purāṇa viz. Brāhmi, Bhagavati, Saurl and Vaiṣṇavi and that the present one is the Brahmi in 6000 verses; the Nāradiya (I. 106. 1-22) furnishes a summary of the other three samhitās. Padma (Pātālakhanda 102, 41-42 J14140 expressly names the Kūrma and quotes a verse from it. Kalpataru (on śrāddha p. 119) quotes two verses from it. Aparārka (pp. 201, 204, 207) quotes three verses from Kūrma (all in relation to fast).

Kartika-amavasyarses on Nandāvrata 328 on Tiladhenu. 

for the reasons for which the Dāpasāgara refused to utilize 1415 it; it is quoted by Bhujabala-nibandha ( about 1040-50 A, D.) on bow Saṅkranti when occurring at different parts of the day affects different people. 1416 Kalpataru quotes Devi purāpa in several kāndas viz. about 210 verses in Rajadharma ( 88 verses on fortified capital); 37 verses on worship of Dovi on Asvina sukla 9 with the bali of goats and buffaloes, 52 on raising a banner in honour of Dovi, 10 verses on gavotsarga on Kārtika-amāvāsyā &c; in Vrata-kāṇda about 80 verses (on Durgāstanı, 25 verses on Nandāvrata, 44 verses with a prose passage ); 245 verses on dāna (such as 28 on Tiladhenu and Ghrtadhenu pp. 147-151, 56 vorges On Vidyādāna pp. 201-207, 98 verses on the construction of kūpa, vāpi, kirglikū &c. pp. 289-299, 27 verses on laying out a park and planting trees pp. 300-303, 10 verses on building a rest-house for ascetics &c, pp. 312-313); in Tirthakānda 103 verses ( 20 verses on śrāddha at a tirtba without examining character and learning of brāhmaṇas ); Niyatakālakāpda quotes 30 verses; Brahmacāri-kānda quotes only a few; Gṭbasthakāṇda quotes 6 verges; Srāddhakāṇda p. 21 quotes only one verso on MaghāśrāddhaAparārka quotes about 34 verses ( 3 of which on qualifications of a sthāpaka are inter osting, p. 16), as they require that he should possess a knowledge of the Vama and Dakṣiṇa paths, of the Mātcult, of Panoarātra and Śaiva sastras. 

Devibhāgavata (pr. by Venk. Press in 12 skandhag)-Vide H. in JOR (Madras) vol. 21 pp. 49-79 (tries to prove that it is younger than the Bhagavata); 'Dovi-bhagavata and Bhagavata' by Mr. Tadpatrikar in ABORI vol. 23 pp. 559-562; IHQ vol. 27 pp. 191-196 (Mr. Ramchandran says that the relief in Deogarh of Nara-Narayana is based on Devibhagavata IV, 5-10); H. in IHQ vol. 29 pp. 387–392 does not agree with Mr. Ramchandran. 

Nandi purana (U). Vide H. OD 'Bphan-nandikesvara and Nandikośvara' in Dr. B. C. Law Presentation vol. part I. pp. 415-419 and in JGJRI vol. II pp. 305-320; Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar in NIA vol. IV. pp. 157-161 on Nandipurāṇa (holda that the original Purāṇa is probably lost, that verses quoted from It by Lakṣmidbara are almost all on gifts of various kinde).

Kalpataru on dāna quotes over 200 verses from it on dana ( of which 140 are on Vidyādāna pp. 207–222, 12'yorses on Arogya.. dana, which provide for the establishment of an hospital with a physician knowing the eight angas of āyurveda and provided with drugs &o); Apararka (pp. 396-403) quotes about 100. versios on vidyadāna agreeing with those in Kalpataru and also quotes (pp 365–366 ) the same verses on Arogyadāna; Kalpataru on Niyatakāla quotes 13 verses from this purāṇa advocating total abstention from flesh-eating (p. 323 ) and abstaining from flesh at least on the 4th, 8th, 12th 14th and 15th tithis, on Sedasiti and sun's passage from one rāśi to another &o. (pp. 353-360). As this is one of the four upapurāṇas expressly named by the Matsya, as Alberuni mentions a Nanda-purāṇa which (appears to be the same as Nandi) and as it is largely quoted by Lakṣmidhara, Aparārka and Dānasāgara it is one of the earliest Upapurāṇas and may have been composed in the 8th or 9th century A.D. 

Narasimhapurāpa (or Nșsimha). This U. has been dealt with above on pp. 878-882. Kalpataru on vrata quotes 29 verges from it ( 22 on Ganesacaturthi pp. 84-87 almost all of which are found in the current work, chap. 26. 2-20); Kalpataru on Tirtha quotes 66 verses from it, almost all of which are in chap. 65.2-31, 66. 1-9, 20-45 of the current work; Kalpataru on Niyatakāla quotes 65 verses almost all of which are found in chap. 58; Kalpataru on Mokṣa quotes 57 Verses, which can be traced in chapters 17, 58, 59, 60, 61; the Danakānda of Kalpataru quotes 13 verses ( found in chap. 30. 27 ff. ), and Brahmacārikāṇda quotes four verses; Aparārka quotes about 40 verses from Nṛsimha, of which 16 concern yati (pp. 951, 965 from chap. 60. 12 £.), 17 verses deal (p. 140 ) with arghya to the Sun (from 58. 91-93) by the employ ment of the 16 verses of the Puruṣasūkta for nyāsa on the different parts of the body and also the sixteen (from chap. 62. 5-14) upacāras from āvāhane (invoking to come) to visarjana (bidding adieu) in worship, 5 verses on Narasimba-pūjā with the mantra 'Om namo Nārāyanaya' (63. 3 and 6). Out of 3 verses on p. 125 dealing with evening sandhyā and homa attributed to this Purāṇa two are the same as Dakṣa-smki (II. 28-29). $m. C. quotes 27 verses on Āhnika from Narasimha. It appears that both Kalpataru and Aparārka had a much longer version befora them than the present purāṇa. It may be noted that Kșomaka who was the last king of the Aila-vamsa (acc. to Vāyu 99. 43% and others ), is described in the Narasimha-purana (chap. 23:) as the son of Naravahana and grand-son of the famous anciónt couple -

Udayana and Vābavadattā. The extant purāns may be assigned to about 9th century A. D. 

Nāradapurāṇā-(Venk. Press). Vide H. in I. C. vol. III, p. 477-488, PRHR. pp. 127-133 on "Bphan-nāradiya and Nāradiya' and 'Studies &c.' vol. I pp. 309-345. The Bphan. nāradiya was published by the Calcutta Asiatic Society and by the Vangavāsi Press in 38 chapters and about 3600 verses. H. bolds that the Brhan-Dāradiya is a purely sectarian Vaiṣṇava work, is wanting in the characteristics of a purāṇa, that the Nāradiya noticed by the Matsya (53. 23 as containing 23000 verses and in which Nārada proclaimed the dharmas of Br̥hatkalpa) and by the Agni (272, 8) is different from the present Nāradiya and that the extant Nāradiya borrows from the Brban-nāradiya (pp. 336–341 of 'Studies &c.' vol. I). The Nāradiya (Venk, Press) is divided into two parts, the first in 125 chapters and the 2nd in 82 chapters (and about 5513 verses in all). Out of the 5513 verses of the 2nd part 3400 deal with various tirthas and most of the remaining are concerned with the story of Rukmāngada and Mohini, The first part deals with several matters such as praise of Viṣṇu and bhakti, Geography of India, story of Sagara, Bhagiratha and Gargā-māhātmya, a few vratas, Varna dharma, Aśramadharma, pātakas, sadācāra and śrāddha. Nāra diya 1. 9.40 has a verse which echoes a Kirātārjuniya verset:17 and proclaims that a brahmana who enters a Bauddha temple even in a great calamity cannot get rid of the sin by hundreds of expiations, since the Bauddhas are heretics and revilers of 1418 Veda. The first part speaks of Vaiśnavāgama (37, 4) and Pancarātra procedure (53,9). The Sm. C. quotes many yerses from the extant Nāradiya on Ekādaśī and the story of Mohini. One characteristic passage may be quoted here.1419 Rukmangada proclaimed that any person more than eight years of age and below 80 years who would eat food on the day of Viṣṇu in his kingdom would be liable to corporal punishment, fine or banish ment. Aparārka also (p. 205 ) quotes two verses about fast on

Ekadasi. The above circumstances lead to the conclusion that the present Nāradiya was compiled between 700 and 1000 A. D. 

Padmapurāṇa --H. in I. C. vol. IV. pp. 73-95, Mr. M. V. Vaidya in Kano presentation vol pp. 530-537 (holds that the tirthayatrā section of Padma is older than the tirthayātrā section in the Mahābhārata), Dr. Belvalkar in F. W. Thomas Festschrift (pp. 19-28) holds that Padma is based on the Mahābhārata: Prof. Lūders tried to prove that the Rṣyaśṛnga legend in Padma is older than the same legend in the Mahābhārata (vide I. E.Q., vol. XX. p. 209 for Lūder's view); H. in PRHR. (pp. 107 129 ) states that there are two recensions of the Padma the North Indian and the South Indian, that the former is in five kāṇdas and the latter in six, that the South Indian recension alone is published in the Ānandāśrama and Venk. Press editions, though the arrangement differs in the two editions. H. in PRHR (p. 126 ) states that the Uttara-kāṇda ( of the Padma ) is later than 900 A. D. and earlier than 1500 A. D. One remarkable fact is that hundreds of verses are common to Matsya and Padma and some writers like Hemādri quote long extracts from the Padma, which others quote from the Matsya. In view of the vast smrti material in the Matsya and the fact that thousands of verses therefrom aro quoted in the medieval nibandhas the present writer is inclined to hold that it is the Padma that is the borrower. There are no materials to assign a definite date for the borrowing, but it is likely that it was before 1000 A. D. Padma (IV. 102. 40-41 and IV. 110, 483) mentions the Kūrma (and a verse is quoted from it) and IV. 5. 32-43 contain such alankāras as Śleṣa and Parisankhyā. The Kalpataru quotes from Padma about 55 verses on vrata, 50 on Diyatakāla, 50 on dana, 1% on tirtha, only a verse here and there on other kāndes. Aparārka quotes only about 12 verses from it, the Smsticandrikā only about 25. In the Anandāśrama edition of Padma there are 48452 verses and 628 chapters. It speaks of the Asvattha as Bodhisattva (Sșstikhanda 55. 16 ) and mentions a place called Vanasthala in Gurjaradeśa (II. 51. 36-37). 

Brahmapurana-The one printed at the Ānandāśrama appearg to be a late compilation. Vide H. on 'Apocryphal Brahmapurāṇa' in I. O. II. pp. 235-245 and PRHR pp. 145-157, H. states that numerous quotations from the Brahma occurring in the works of Jimūtavāhana, Aparārka, Ballālasena, Deyanna bhatta and Haradatta are not found in the printed Brahma, that the current Brahma borrows chapters from the Mahabharata, Viṣṇu, Vāyu and Markandeya and that the present Brahma. 

894 

History of Dharmadāstra (Seo. IV, Ch. XXII 

was composed between 10th century and 12th century A. D. H. Otto Sobrader states that chapters 236-244 of the present Brahma dealing with Sāṅkhya and Yoga are borrowed from the Mahabharata (L.C. vol. II, pp.592-93). The Dānasāgara refers to two Brahmapuranas one of which it did not utilize (p. 7 verse 63). The Kalpataru quotes at least about 1500 verses from the Brahmapurāpa (600 in niyalakūla section, 66 on tirtha, 60 on mokṣa, 78 on rājadharma, 21 on gṭhastha, 20 on vyavahāra, versos 15 on vrata, 15 on brabmacarin of which the editor has traced only 9 in the printed text). The Kalpataru on śrāddha quotes soveral hundred verses from the Brahma, the number of quotations being larger than the quotations from any other Purana, the next being Vāyu and Matsya. On p. 388 of the śrāddba section the Kalpataru quotes from Brabma-purāṇa a few verses about showing honour to Buddha and Bauddha monks on a certain tithi. The printed Brabma contains 245 chapters and 13783 verses. Chapters 70-175 deal with various tīrthas in 4640 verses, chapters 28 to 69 dilate upon several tirthas such as Kopāditya, Ekāmra, Avanti, Purusottama-tirtha. The whole purana or at least a section seems to come to an end with chapter 175 and from chapter 176 it is Vasudevamābātmya that is set forth up to chap. 213 and the narrator is Vyasa and not Brahmā as in the chapters up to 175. Many of the verges from chapters 42 onwards are quoted by the Tirthacintamani (e. g. chap. 43. 1-13 in T. C. p. 58–59, chap. 45, 52-89 in T. C. pp. 61-64, chap. 49 in T. C. pp. 65–72). As Vācaspati flourished in the latter half of the 15th century A. D. (vide H of Dh. vol. I. p 405), the first part of the prosent Brahmapurāṇa cannot be placed later than the 13th century A. D. The present Brahma has several verses in common with Brahmānda and Vāyu (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 388 n 870). It is not unlikely that the other Brahmapurāṇa which Ballālasena discarded is the present Brahmapurāṇa and that both Kalpataru and Ballalasena had an older work of the same name before them. The prosent Brahma was probably compiled in some part through which the Godavari (Gautamı) flows in Dandakāranya; chap. 88. 18. 123. 117 and 129. 55 atate that Daṇdakāranya is the holiest country and that the river Godāvarf flows through it (chap. 129. 62, 66); chap. 88. 22-24 derive Janasthāda on the Gautaml as the sacrificial ground of the kings of the Janaka race. 

Brahmavaivarta -A huge work printed by the Ananda srama, Poona, in four khandas (parts ) viz. Brahma, Praksti. 

Brahmavaivartu-purāṇı 

895 

Ganapati and Kronajanma. It has some chapters on Dharma sastra topios, such as on castes, gifts, vratas, bolls, duties of varpas and aśramas, women. Many of the versog quoted from this Purana in the Sm. C., Hemādri and other writers are not found in the current Purana. Wilson, in the Introduction to the Viṣṇu, says (pp. LXV-LXVII) that it has not the slightest title to be called a Purāṇa. Vide H, in A.BORI vol. XIX pp. 75-76 and PRHR pp. 166-167 

Brahmānda ( pub, by Venk. Pregs). It is divided into four pādas (I. 1. 33-39) viz. Prakriya (5 chapters ), Anuṣanga (33 chap.), Upodghāta (74 chap.), Upasarhāra (4 chap ) followed by Lalitopakhyāna in 40 chapters. The Kurma expressly 1420 states that the Brahmānda was narrated to the sages engaged in a sattra in the Naimisa forest and the Skanda (Prabhāsa-khanda 2. 8-9 ) states there was formerly only one Purāṇa called Brahmānda containing one hundred crores of verses and that later it was distributed into 18 parts. It was probably composed near the rise of the Godāvarī, since it says that that part of the country towards the northern ranges of the Sabya mountain where the Godāvari rises is the most charming in the whole world and that there a city called Govardhana was foun ded by Rāma. 1421 In the first two parts it deals with the subjects of creation, the geography of the earth and of Bhāratavarṣa, and the manvantaras, pupils of Vyāsa, the distribution of the Veda Sakhās &c. The third section is the longest and after mentioning Vaivasvata Manvantara and, after dilating upon the creation of gods, asuras, gandharvas, sages and their progeny, it deals at length with all aspects of śrāddha ( in chap. 9-20 and 879 verses ), describes Parafurāmā's austerities, his securing of weapons, his , slaughter of Kārtavirya and kṣatriyas, filling five lakos with their blood (in chap. 21-47 and over 1550 verses); then follow in chapters 48-57 the story of Sagara and the bringing down of the Ganges by Bhagiratha, the protection of Gokarna from the sea, and the story of Sūrpāraka (chap. 57 and 58), the dynasties of the solar and lunar race (chap. 598); then it speaks of Dhanvantari receiving from Bhāradvāja Ayurveda in eight angas; in part IV. it refers to Manus, jñāna, karma, mokṣa &c.

The Brahmāṇda is one of the oldest of the 18 Purāṇas and has hundreds of verses in common with the Vāyu. Vide above p. 852. The Mit. on Yaj. quotes a verse from the Brahmānda 1422 stating that a person, on touching Śaivas, Pāśupatas, Lokāyatikas and atheists, persons of the three varpas following forbidden paths and śūdras, should bathe with the clothes on. Aparārka quotes about 75 verses from it of which 43 are concerned with śrāddha. The Sm. C. quotes about 50 verses on Ābnika and Srāddha, of which ten occur also in Aparārka The Kalpataru does not quote a single verse from it in the sections on viata, grhastha, tirtha, rājadharma, but quotes 16 verges from it on grāddha, and 16 on mokṣa, none from Niyata, and from Vyavahāra. If we may judge from some of the matters noted here it cannot be placed as early as the Matsya. In ILI. 48.8 and 20 it employs long com pounds, 1923 mentions Bhimasena and Nārada 1424 as writers on music (III. 61, 42-43), contains a chapter (III, 62) on Gāndharya, refers to the opinions of former acāryas, to 30 alankāras of nātya and four purposes of such alavkāras (chap. 62, verse 22). It may be placed between the 4th and 6th century A. D. For discussion on Brahmānda, vide Pargiter in AIHT pp. 23,77 and H. in PRHR (pp. 17–19). The Brahmāṇda is very fond of etymologies; vide for example, those of vaisya and sūdra (II. 7. 157-158 ), of deva, manuṣya-prajā, raksas and yakṣa (II. 8. 9-10, 20, 34), of Tryambaka and Rudra (II, 9. 3-4 and 78), of rājan (in II. 29, 64), of Vasudhā, Medini and Pștbivi (11. 37. 1-3), of Atri, Vasiṣtha, Pulaha and Pulastya (III. 1. 44-46), of Kubora (III. 8. 44-45). 

Brhad-dharma-purūna ( U.) - Vide H, in J. of University of Gauhati and 'Studies &c.' vol. I, pp. 115 and 277. It is a work of Bengal of the 13th or 14th century A. D. 

Bhaviṣyapurāṇa -- Accounts of the contents of the Bhaviṣya in Matsya 53, 30–31, Agni 272. 12 and Nāradiya 1 100 do not tally with the printed Bhaviṣya (Venk, ed.). It is divided into four parvans viz. Brāhma, Madhyama, Pratisarga and Uttara. It is only the Brahmaparva that can claim an early date. The Pratisarga-parya is a modern fabrication containing stories of

The Bhavisyo ttara is discarded by Ballālasena as unauthoritative, though it was popular in his day (vide. p. 869 above). Apararka quotes 160 verses from Bhavisyottara on danas of various kinds. The Sm.C. (I. p. 203) quotes a single verse from the same. Hence the Bhavisyottara cannot be later than 1000 A.D. The Kalpatara quotes hundreds of versos from Bhaviṣya on vrata, and many Verses in other kandas,e.g. 55 in brahmacari, 110 on niyata kala, 101 on grhastha, 100 on rajadharma, 15 on sraddha. The Mit. quotes 1425 a single verse from Bhaviṣya about donating & golden image of a snake when & man is bitten by a snake. Aparārka quotes about 125 verses from Bhaviṣya, of which about 90 relate to prayascittas... 

One remarkable feature of the extracts from Bhaviṣya in Aparārka is that they quote the views of Angiras, Gautama, Parā. sara, Manu, Vasiṣtha and Saṅkha. There are several passages quoted by Aparārka from the Bhaviṣya which approximately indicate the age of the current Bhaviṣya. 1426 It also refers to sight Vyakaranas in I. 1. 59-61 viz. Brahma, Aindra, Yamya, Raudra, Vayavya, Varuna, Savitra and Vaiṣṇava. But these are different from the well-known eight grammars (except Aindra). It mentions the foreign words Ara (Mars) and Kona (Saturn ) 1427 and states these planets are to be worshipped along with Śiva, Parvati, Ganese, the Sun &c. In prescribing a praya soitta for killing & person who is merely a brāhmaṇa by caste the Bhaviṣya prescribes (as one of the alternatives) the prāyascitta prescribed by Parāśara.1428 . Therefore, the extant Bhaviṣya

cannot be placed earlier than about the 6th or 7th century A. D. Vide H, in I. O. vol. III, pp. 223-229 and PRHR pp. 167–173 for Bhaviṣya and JOI ( Baroda) vol. III, pp. 8-27 for Bhavisyottara. The Bhaviṣya mentioned in Vāyu (99. 267 tān sarvān kirtan yiṣyāmi: Bhavisye pathitān nṛpān i tabhyaḥ pare ca ye canye utpatsyante mahikṣitaḥ u) is not the present one but the ancient Bhaviṣyat mentioned by Ap. Dh. S.(vide p. 817 and n 1328 above). The Varāhapurāṇa expressly mentions Bhaviṣyat-purāṇa twice (177.34 and 51 ).1429 The second reference is quite interesting. It appears to say 1429a that the Purāṇa well-known as Bhaviṣya was revised by Samba who then established an image of the Sun, 

Bhāgavatapurūna. None of the early works such as the Mit., Aparārka, Kalpataru, the Smṛticandrikā draw upon thig, The Dānasāgara know it, but, as the Bhāgavata did not contain a disquisition on dānas, the author passed it over. Its date is very controversial, ranging from the 5th century A.D. to the 10th. Dr. Pusalkar (in 'Studies in Epics and Puranas' 1953, pp. 214-216) brings together most of the papers on this subject; Shri S. S. Sastri in ABORI vol 14 pp. 241-249 on the two Bhagavatas' claims that the Dovibhāgavatapurāṇa is earlier than the Bhagavata, while H. in JOR ( Madras) vol. 21 (pp. 48–79) takes the opposite view, viz. that the Devibhāgavata is much younger than the Bhigavata. In 'Date of the Bhāgavata-purāṇa' by B. N. Krishna mūrti Sharma in ABORI. vol. 14 pp. 182-218 it is argued that the Bhagavata is as old as the 5th century A. D. and he cites in support certain passages from the Mokṣadharma of the Mahā. bhārata (Kumbhakonam edition), but the critical edition from Poona treats those passages as apocryphal. Prof. Das Gupta in the 4th volume of his 'Indian Philosophy' deals with this Purāṇa, but his views are criticized in JBRS vol. 36 pp. 9-50. Vide H. in NIA vol. I. pp. 522–528. The Padma part VI. (chapter 189–194) contains a Māhālmya of Bhagavatapurāṇa in 518

1429 a. The Varāba mentions ( 178. 5-7) three temples of the Sun, one to the south of the Yamusi, the 2nd in the middle called Kalapriya and the third to the west at Mūlastbāna ( modero Multān), The Bbaviṣya pen. tions three important places of sud-worship (viz Muadira, Kalapriya and Mitravaga).

verson. The author of the Purāṇa is said to be a native of the Tamil country by Mr. M. R. Majumdar in IHQ vol. 8. pp. 49-53. The present writer thinks that it is a late Purana, since even in the Moksakāṇda (of Kalpataru) it is not cited, while about 300 verses are cited from the Viṣṇupurāṇa in that kāṇda alone. Vide note 1604 below. No reliable and cogent evidence has been adduced to prove that the current Bhāgayata can be placed earlier than the 9th century A. D. 

Matsya purana ( Anandāśrama ed.). It has 291 chapters and 14062 verses. It is one of the ancient Purāpas and has perhaps the largest number of smrti chapters among Purāṇas. Many Verses of the Manusmrti and the Mahābhārata occur in it. Somo verses of Yāj. also occur in Matsya e. g. Yāj. I. 295 is Matsya 93.2, Yaj. II. 279.295-6 and 303 are the same as Matsya 227.200, 202–203 and 204. It appears that the Matsya holds the balance between Śiva and Viṣṇu. It glorifies not only Viṣṇu in the Mataya avatāra but devotes 1570 verses to the slaughter of Tārakāgura and 623 to the destruction of Tripura, both by Śiva. The Vāmanapurāṇa (12. 48) speaks of it as the principal among Purāṇas. 

The Mit. on Yāj. I. 297 expressly quotes all the nine verses of chap. 94 of the Matsya ( about the form of the images of the planets) and two verses from chap. 93 (11-12) about the position to be assigned to each with white grains of rice in a mandala The Kalpataru quotes hundreds of verses from Matsya on vrata, quotes about 750 on dāna from Matsya (all of which except 20 are identified in the present Mataya by the editor); about 410 on Rājadharmakāṇda, 157 verses on tirtha ( of which 100 are identified by the editor in the Matsya), 115 verses in Gphastha kaṇda, 112 Verses on śrāddba, about 67 OD Diyatakāla (all except 12 identified), 18 in vyavahārakānda, 6 in brahmacāri and % in mokṣa, in all about 2000 verses. Apararks quotes about 400 verkos from Matsya ( about 250 being on dana). It is not necessary after the preceding statement to go into the large number of verses quoted in Dānasāgara, Smrti-candrikā and Homādri. It may be said without fear of contradiction that long before 1000 A. D. the Matsya-purāṇa had the same arrange ment and presented almost the same appearance as at present. This is more than what can be said about the other Purapas except Viṣpu, Vayu, probably Bhaviṣya (I), Mārkandeya. 

In the prosent author's opinion the Matsya is among the best preserved and the earlieat of the 18 Puranas. It may be 

900 

History of Dharmaśāstra (Seo. IV, Ch. XXIII 

dated between 200 A. D. to 400 A. D. The author does not wish to deny that a few verses here and there might have been inter polated at a later dato. 

Vide H. on the dates of the smrti chapters of Mataya in ABORI vol. 17 pp. 1–36 and PRHR pp. 26-52 and Prof. Ram chandra Dikshitar on 'Matsyapurāṇa, a study' (Madras, 1935, pp. 1-140). Four verses from a Svalpa-matsya-purāṇa aro quoted in the Pitrdayitā (p. 92) of Aniruddha (about 1160 A. D.) and there is a paper thereon by Shri Manoranjana Shastri in J. G. J. R. I, vol. IX pp. 183-188. Matsya and Padma ( as stated before ) agree verbatim in many chapters on tirthas and vratas. Saṅkarācārya quotes a verse from Paurānikas which is Matsya.1430 Among the sages to whom water is offered in tarpana are included (by Matsya) Kapila, Āsuri, Vodbu and Pancaśikha. The first two and the last are mentioned in the Sāṅkhyakarikā as the three great founders of the sankhya system. Vararuci is said to be a profound scholar of Natya-veda. In chap. 24 the Purana refers to the fact that the Apsaras Urvasi and her friend Citralekha were kidnapped by a demon called Keśin, who was vanquished by Purūravas and Urvasi was released and was given by Indra to Purūravas. While she was acting the part of Lakṣmi in a drama called Lakṣmi-8vayamvara composed by Bharata, she, being engrossed in her passion for Purūravas, forgot the proper abhinaya taught by Bharata and was cursed by Bharata to be a creeper. It is difficult to say whether the Matsya got its inspiration for this story froni the Vikramor vasiya or whether the great poet Kalidāsa was influenced by the story in the Matsya. The story in Matsya and in Kālidāsa's drama agree very closely as regards names and incidents. The Matsya says (24.24) that for vanquishing Keśin Purūravas employed Vāyavya-astra. The drama also mentions it (I.). 

1430. ANTE: hinten: 1 persegi: C aren 7 aro teriai Folasa: vi ha agranyte goure 1 Frari on a. a. II. 1. 27. This is HART 113. 6. This verse occurs also in Hong 5. 12 but there the reading is fra for TT. Besides, the word ditora ( groata ga terforeni: acc. to a IV. 2. 59) suggests that the acārya refers to a grand not to the महाभारत. कपिलश्वासुरिश्चैव वोदुः पञ्चशिखस्तथा। सर्वे ते तृप्तिमायान्तु महत्तेनाम्बुनाखिलाः ॥ Hity 102 18 quoted in mara.

The only points of difference are : in the drama Lakṣmi-syayam vara is said to have been composed by Sarasvati, while Matsya does not say so. Besides, the Purāṇa says that Urvasi was cursed by Bharata to be a creeper, while Kālidāsa says nothing of the kind and shows that her being reduced to the condition of a creeper was due to Kumāra ( Kārtikeya ). The decision depends on the exact dating of the Matsya from other evidence. I am in. clined to believe that Kālidāsa was familiar with the episode rela ted in the Matsya. There are scholars who believe that Kalidasa flourished under Vikramāditya about 57 B. C. The present writer does not subscribe to this belief. There is hardly any reliable or positive evidence to show that a powerful ruler called 

Vikramaditya ruled Northern and Central India about 57 B.C. The tradition of the pine jewels is of no use and if relied upon would make Vikramāditya rule about the 5th or 6th century A.D., since Amarasimha, Varāhamihira and Kalidasa would be con temporarios. A coin of the Gupta Emperor Candragupta II (Allen's Catalogue of coins, pp. 35 ff.) bas jerar hararea a fabuffet. The present writer believes that the most probable date for Kālidāsa is between 350 to 450 A. D. 

Mārkandeya-purāṇa-Thore are two editions, viz. B. J. edition ( of 1862 ) and the Venk. Press ed. The present author has mainly used the latter for quotations. The two differ slightly 

as to the number of verses in almost each chapter e. g. there are 270 verges in chap. 8 of B.J. edition and 287 in Venk, ed.; chapter 16 of the Venk, edition corresponds to chapters 16-18 of the other edition. There are 134 chapters in the Venk, edition and 137 in B. J. edition. Pargiter translated into English the Mārkandeya. In the first 42 chapters (B. J. ed.) Mārkandeya takes hardly any part, but in the remaining chapters he is the principal speaker. This is a peculiar Purāṇa. The first chapter opens with four questions put by Jaimini to Mārkandeya about Mahābhārata saga, viz. (1) why nirguṇa Vāsudeva assumed a human form, (2) how Draupadi became the wife of five brothers, ( 3 ) Balarama performed expiation of brahmahatyā by pilgrimage (and not by his own death), (4) how the five unmarried sops of Draupadi, themselves great warriors, met death helplessly although they had the great Pāndava heroes to protect them. Mārkandeya directs him to go to wise birds in the Vindhya mountain and the answers are given in chapters 4 to 7. One wonders why Jaimini said to be a pupil of Vyāsa in the Purāṇas did not go to Vyāsa but to Mārkandeya. A portion of this Purāṇa is called

Devimahātmya or Saptasati 1431 (chapters 78-90 of Veók, ed. and 81-93 of B. J. edition) and is deemed by modern Sanskrit scholars to be an interpolation. But even if it is an inter polation it must have been made before the 10th century, as the oldest known ms. of it is dated 998 A.D. and probably before 600 A. D. The Mārkandeya has practically no verses on vrata, pilgrimages or śānti, but dilates on the duties of aśramas, on rājadharma, śrāddha, holls, karmavipāka, sadacāra, yoga, (explained by Dattatreya to Alarka ), stories of Kartavirya, bis grandson Kuvalayāśva and of Madālasā, creation, manvantaras, geography &c. It has bardly any sectarian bias; prayers and invocations are few except in the Davimāhātmya. The present Purāpa has, as indicated above, three different and disconnected sections viz. chapters 1-42 (Vonk, ed.), where the wise birds figure as speakers, chapters 43 to end where Mārkandeya and Kroṣtuki, a disciple, carry on the discourse, except in Devl. māhātmya, which is the third and an independent section. 

The Kalpataru on mokṣa quotes about 120 verses from Mārkandeya on yoga. almost all of which are found in the printed text. It quotes on brahmacārikānda 9 verses, 1% on srāddha, 17 on niyatakāla, 19 on gphastha, 3 on rājadharma and one on vyavahāra. Aparārka quotes about 85 verses froun the Mārkandeya of which 42 are on yoga and the rest on śrāddha, giving alms, hospitality, suddhi &o. The Sm. C. quotes 15 Verses from Mārkandeya on āhnika, 40 verses on śrāddha. Mārkandeya quotes several verses from Manu and Mahābhārata. Markandeya contains some long drawn out rūpakas as in 3.59-70(where prajña is said to be a fort-wall and the soul as king therein) and 35. 8-13 (ahamityankurotpannaḥ &c.). It contains the popular idea that for married women long stay with their relativos (in the family of birth) does not conduce to good reputation and that the desire of her relatives (by blood) is that a married woman should stay in her husband's house. 1932 The Mārkandeya says that the root of all

The verse HEMATA cited above on p. 176 D. 4548 (from laterra) is quoted in the Dadhimati-mātā inscription (found in the Jodbpar State) dated 289 of the Gupta era (E. I. vol. XI p. 299 at 303 ). The ioscription being of 608 A. D., it follows that the verse taken from the Devimābātmya, is earlier than 600 A.D.

unhappiness is the idea that one is the owner, ( of this and that) and that bliss comes with the idea nothing is mina 1213 In chap. 160.39 it refers to lagna and horā It puts forward the dootrine of the Gitā that actions done without any desire for their roward do not tend to become obains binding down a man to sainsāra. On the other hand, this Purāṇa narrates the story of Datta 1434 or Dattatreye who imparted instruction on yoga to Alarka (from chap. 16 ff), but who is represented as an avatāra of Viṣṇu givon to drinking intoxicants, as fond of the company of women, as staying near a water reservoir constructed with wood and stones on the Sabya ( 16. 132 ) and is called Avadhūta ( 17. 3). In chap. 54 it is said (just as in Brahmānda oited above p. 895) that the country in the north ranges of Sahya and near the Godāvari is the most charming in the world 

On the whole this is one of the early parūpas and may be assigned to a date between the 4th to 6th century A. D. 

Lingapurāṇa (Venk, ed.). It has 11000 verses as stated in chap. II. 5. The Kalpataru on tirtha quotes about one thousand Verses from it on Avimuktaka (Banaras) and the sub-tīrshas therein, Aparārka quotes six versos from it on Śivapājā on the 8th and 14th tithis and bath and śrāddba in selipses. The Smr. C. quotes a few versos from it on bath in eolipses, Veda study & According to the Dānasāgara (p. 7 verse 64) there was another Lingapurana of 6000 verses which it had not utilized Vide H. in I. C. vol. IV. pp. 415-421 and in PRHR pp. 92-96. 

Varāhapurāṇa (B. I. edition). It has 817 chapters and 9654 Verses, besides a few chapters entirely in prose (such as 81-89, 86-87 and 74 on bhuvanakośa) and a few in mixed prose and Verso (such as 80, 84, 85, 88, 89). It is a Vaiṣṇava Purana and begins with the well-known verse 'Nārāyaṇam namaskrtya 'and is supposed to have been Darrated to the Earth by Viṣṇu in the

Boar incarnation. It is remarkable that Vyāga does not appear in the Purāṇa, though the Sūta figures at the beginning of soveral chapters (e. g. chap. 1, 2, 39, 50, 127, 137-138, 148, 151, 181, 213). It deals with most of the general topics of Dharma śāstra such as vrata, tirtha, dāna, images and their worship, āśauca, śrāddha, karmavipāka, narakas, cosmology and geo graphy, prāyaścitta &c. The Kalpataru quotes 150 verses from it on vrata (most of which are traced by the editor), 40 verses on śrāddha (none of which is traced), 250 verses on tirtha (many of which are traced), 17 on niyatakāla (half traced), five on dāna (all traced), 4 in grhasthakāṇda (not traced). One peculiarity is that it mentions some tirthas like Lohārgala and Stutasyāmi which are not described in other Purāṇas. Aparārka quotes about 55 verses from it on several topics. 

The Brahmapurāṇa 1433 refers to a Vārāha text laying down a srāddha for pitrs on the Full Moon when the sun is in Virgo. The Bhavisyottara also (32. 12) refers to Varābayacana. For the priority of the Bhaviṣya to Varāha vide above p. 898. Varaba refers to a saka prince called Nandavardhana (in chap. 122. 34) and verse 56 refers to a saka king. 

Vide H. in ABORI vol. 18 pp. 321-337. It is difficult to assign a date to the Varāhapurāṇa. It is not one of the early Purāṇas. In any event it is earlier than the 10th century A.D. 

Vāmanapurūna (Vonk, ed.). It is a short purāṇa as com pared with Matsya, Vāyu, Varāba &c. It has 5451 verses in the Venk, ed. There is prose in chapters 26, 44 and 93. For its size it contains many legends, such as Śhaṅkara cutting off a head of Brahma, the story of Prablāda and his grandson Bali and the latter's downfall, the greatness of Devi and her exploits, marriage of Śiva and Umā at the request of gods, the birth of Kārtikeya and explanation of his various names, the story of Danda who was cursed by Sukra for rape, enmity between Vasistha and Viśvāmitra, Gajendramokṣa &c. It briefly deals with many of the usual dharmaśāstra subjects viz. tirtha, sadācāra, āśramadharma, sāmāngadharma, vrata, karmavipāka &c. The Kalpataru quotes from Vamana about 88 verses on tirtha (only some of which have been traced), about 80 verses

· The Vamana-purāṇa mentions Kāmaśāstras in 91.73 and Mangalavāra (Tuesday) in 41. 24. It has been stated above p. 899 that it expressly mentions Matsya as the best among Purāṇas. The story of king Danda (in 63. 19 f.) who perished along with the kingdom because he tried to violate Sukra's daughter appears to be an echo from Kautilya's Arthaśāstra (I. 6 p. 11 'Dāṇdakyonāma Bhojaḥ kamāt brāhmaṇakanyām abhi. manyamānaḥ sabandhurāṣtro pinanāsa.). It states that the king is called rājan because he keeps the subjects contented, just as Kālidāsa sayg. 1437 It says that Umā was so called because 1458 she was forbidden to practise 'tapas' in the words *u nā' and that Sive assumed the form of a Vedic student carry ing a staff of Aṣāḍha (Palasa) and wearing a girdle of Muñja grags. This also appears like an echo of Kumārasambhava V. 

The Sm.c. I. p. 168 quotes the two verses in which the Vāmana prescribes that a man after a bath and homa should leave his house (for businoss &c.) after touching certain objects deemed to be auspicious (noted below). 

Taking all these matters into consideration the Vamana purāpa would have to be placed between 600 to 900 A. D. Vide H. in IHQ XI. pp. 115-130 and PRHR pp. 76–92. 

1436. On p. 358 of the Kalpatarı on Niyatakāla three verses are quoted - as from Vāmada-parāna which the editor was not able to trace. They are three verses from Vamana 14, 48-51 quoted above on p. 71. note 178. The first of those three verses is quoted from the Vāmada-porāna by Bhujabala aibandha p. 343. The last two of the three verses are quoted from Vamana by Sm, C. p. 125

History of Dharnaśāstra (860. IV, Ch. XXM 

Vayupurāṇa (Anandasrama ed.). This has 112 chapters and 10991 verses. It appears to have been divided like the Brahmānda into four pādas, Prakrivā (chap. 1-6), Anuṣangs (chap. 7-64), Upodghāts (65-99 ) and Upasamhāra (100-11%). In the first chap., the first verse is the famous one 'Narayanam namaskrtya' and the 2nd eulogises Vyāsa ( both those are not found in several mss.). The third verse refers to bhakti for Śiva Chap. 104 is not found in many mss. and the chapters at the end on Gayāmāhātmya are deemed to be later additions by some scholars. There is Śaiva bias in several chapters such as chap. 20. 31-35 (with & prose passage containing Vedic texts). 24. 91-165 (called Sarvastotra), chap. 55 (Śivastuti put in the mouth of Viṣṇu), chap. 101. 215-330. Probably to counter balance this the chapters on Gaya were added and also the praise of Yiṣpu in chap. 98 where Dattatreya, Vyāda, Kalkin are said to be avatāras of Viṣṇu, but Buddha is not mentioned. Chapter 99 is the longest one in the Purāọa, contains 464 verses and is full of legendary material and historical references. There are several verses in the Purāṇa that appear also in the Mahābhārata, Manu and Matsya. For its relation to Brabmanda vide pp. 85, 896 above. This Purā pa, like the Matsya, contains much Dharmaśāstra material. It is one of the oldest and most authoritative Purāṇas, though it contains some later additions. 

The Vāyu is not quoted in the prata and niyatakala seo tions of the Kalpataru, but it is largely quoted in several other sections. From the Vāyupurāṇa Kalpataru quotes about 160 verses on śrāddha 1439 (of which the editor identified only about 21), about 35 on mokṣa (most traced), 22 on tirtha, 7 on dana, 5 in brahmacāri and 5 in grhastha. Aparārka quotes about 75 verses from Vāgu out of which 60 concern śrāddha and the rest deal with fast, dravyasuddhi, dāna, sapnyaga and yoga. The Sm. C. quotes only about 24 verses from Vāyu on brāddha, on atithi, on Agnihotra and fuel-sticks. 

The Vayu makes a passing reference to the Gupta dynasty (vide p. 85% above), it knows the yuga of five years (50, 183), 

1439. In spite of great efforts the learned editor of Kalpataru has failed to notice in the Kalpataru several verses on srāddha, tirtha and :mokyt. I have succeeded ja identifying a fow more, viz. Vāyu 75. 24-25 and 45-46 occur in Kalpataru on krāddha (pp. 216-217). Io Kalpatarp on kāddha (p. 168 op Gaya) there are sloven verses quoted from Vāyu left untraced by the editor, which are found is vāya 77. 98-103 and 105-109. On p. 300 of grhasthakānda two verses pot traced aro Vayo 62. 161-162.

and Mega, Tula (50. 196), Makara and Simha (Jupiter therein ) in 82. 41-42. Chapter 87 describes Gītalankāras basing its treat ment on the dootrines of pūrvācāryas. Brahmānda II. 62 is & similar chapter on the same subject and has almost the same verses. 

As it refers to the kings of the Gupta dynasty and as Bāṇa refers to it in the Kādambarl and the Hargacarita, it must be placed between 350 A. D. and 550 A. D. This date is corro borated in several ways. Saṅkarācarya in his Bhāgya on Vedāntasūtrā II, 1. 1 quotes & verse as from a Purāṇa, which is Vāyu except 1440 for one word. In another place Śhaṅkara quotes a verse as smrti which is found in Vāyu with slight variations. Another verse which is cited as smrti by Saṅkarācārya oocurg in Vāyu. The Tattvavaiśāradi of Vācaspati on Yogasūtra I 25 expressly quotes from Vayu 12. 33 and 10. 65-66. 

Vide Prof. Dikshitar on 'Some aspects of the Vāyupurāṇa'. (1933,52 pages, University of Madras); H. in IHQ. Vol 14 pp. 131-139 and PRHR pp. 13-17; Shri D. R. Patil's' Cultural History from the Vāyupurāṇa' (1946, Poona, a Ph. D. thesis). 

Viṣṇupurāṇa-(Venk. Press edition and another published by Messrs. Gopal Narayan and Co. in saka 1824 with two com mentaries, one called Vaiṣṇavakūtacandrika of Ratnagarbha Bhattācārya and the other called Viṣṇucittı). The present text is divided into six aṛsas, 126 chapters and about 6000 verses. There are many chapters in prose alone such as in 4th amsa chapters 7, 8, 9 and many in mixed prose and verse as in arsa 4 chap. 1, 2, 6, 11, 12 &o. As stated above this purāṇa agrees with the definition of purāṇa as pañca-laksana far more than any other puranam This purāṇa is declared to Maitreya by

Parāśara (son of Vasiṣtha), which he received from Sarasvata, who received it from king Purukutsa on the Narmada, who heard it from Dakṣa and others who learnt it from Brahmi. 

Five out of the seven verses of Brahmānda III. 68. 97-103 are the same as Viṣṇu IV. 10. 23-27 (about what Yayāti said about tronā). The same occur in Brahma-purāṇa 12. 40–46. It is likely that all borrow from the Mahābhārata, Adiparva 75. 44 f, 85. 9 ff. and Anuśāsana 7.21 ff. The Mit. on Yājāavalkya II. 6 quotes on Nārāyaṇabali about 14 verses of the Viṣṇu. parāṇa. The Kalpataru on Moksa quotes 250 verses from the Vispu (most of which have been identified), 70 op niyatakāla (almost all traced), 21 on brahmacāri, 28 on śrāddha (only one not traced), 21 on tirtha (all traced), about 45 on gļhastha kanda.1441 Aparārka cites about 75 verses from the Viṣṇupurāpa and the Smrticandrikā about 100. The Kāvyaprakasa 1441 (IV.) quotes two verses from this (V. 13. 21-22 about a gopakanyā attaining final release by her thorough unswerving devotion to Lord Krspa). The Vispupurāṇa teaches in some places the sublime philosophy of advaita;1442 for example, it says 'He who seeks mokṣa should strive for treating all as equal, gods, men, boasta, birds, trees and creeping life are all the form of the Infinite Viṣṇu, though appearing as distinct from each other; one who realizes this should look upon the world as his own self &c.' In another place the Viṣṇupurāṇa 1143 states The mind alone is the cause of the bondage of men and their release; mind that is attached to the objects of the senses tends to bondage, but when it is beyond attachment to them, it tends to moksa', It teaches the central doctrine of the Gitā that actions done without an eye to the reward or fruit thereof do not lead to bondage, 1414 

1441. The editor has traced several verses from t hive, but he did got notice that the three verses on pp. 272-273 (aboat brāhmagas haviog to undergo far more trouble than the sudra) are Viṣṇu VI.2, 22-24,

The date of the Viṣṇupurāṇa is a difficult question. There is no doubt that it is one of the early Purāṇas and that its text is not very much inflated. Hundreds of verses quoted in the three early digests viz. Kalpataru, Aparārka and smrticandrikā can be traced in the current text and this leads to the inference that the text has remained fixed for at least a thousand years, One important fact is that in this Parāṇa Vyasa and the Sūta do not play a prominent part as in many other Purāṇas. It states as some other Purāṇas do, that Vyāsa had four pupils to whom he imparted the four Vedas and a fifth pupil the Sūta Romaharsana (III. chapters 3-7). But the sūta does not appear anywhere as the narrator of this Purāṇa. In the 4th am a one remarkable matter is the mention of Sākya, Suddhodana and Rāhula and it is stated that Suddhodana was 23rd in descent from Bṛbad-bala of the Ikṣvāku line (chap. 22). The possibility of interpolations, particularly in the prose passages, would have to be admitted. Rāśis are referred to in III. 14.5 (rāśiṣvarke oa gacchati) and the words lagna and horā also appear (in a prosto passage). Vācaspati in his commentary on the Yogabhāsy& 2. 32 quotes it by name on yamas and niyamas (Viṣṇu VI. 7. 36-38 ) and a half yerse 'evam bhadrāsanādinām' eto., Vispa VI. 7. 49 in com. on Yogabhāsya III. 49. Vācaspati wrote his Nyāyagūcinibandha in vatsara 888 which should be taken as Vikrama year as he was a northerner and as the word 'vatsara' is used ( and not saka) i. . 841 A. D. 

The following may be read on this question. Wilson's Intro. to the translation of the Viṣṇu, vol. I. pp. LIX-LXXIII ; E. 

date of Viṣṇupurāpa' in ABORI Vol. 18 pp. 265-275 and PRHR pp. 19-26 (puts if between 100-350 A. D.); Prof. Dikshitar in Pro. of the 13th Indian History Congress pp. 46-50; Jos. Abs in Festgabe Jacobi pp. 386–396 (on heterodox systems mentioned in different Purāṇas including the Viṣṇu). Vide above p. 869 for a Viṣṇupurāṇa of 23000 verses not utilized by the Dānasāgara. It would not be far from the truth to hold that the present Viṣṇu was composed between 300 to 500 A. D.

Viṣṇudhar mottara (U. pub. by Venk. Press). It is a huge work and has been dealt with above (pp. 876-878). In spite of its huge size it is not quoted by the Kalpataru on vrata, tirtha, brahmacari, grhastha, rājadharma, mokṣa and other kāpdas. Aparārka quotes only 30 verses from it, of which 24 are on dāna: the Smrticandrika quotes about 30 in all and that Danasāgara quotes profusely from it on dana. It cannot be earlier than 600 A D., and cannot be placed later than the 10th century, though parts of it may be later additions. Chapters 52-65 of the first section are called ŚhaṅkaragItā. The Kālikā Purana expressly refers (in chap. 91. 70 and 92. 2) to the Viṣṇudharmottara as having been concerned with Rājaniti and Sadācāra. 

Sambapurana (U. pub. by Venk. Press). Vide H. in 'Sambapurāṇa through the ages in JASB vol. 18 (1952) pp. 91 111, ‘on Samba-purana' a saiva work in ABORI VOL 36 (1955) pp. 62-84 and 'Studies &o.' vol. I. pp. 32-108. This purāṇa is hardly ever quoted by early digests such as the Kalpataru, Aparārka or Smṛticandrikā. Only four verses from it are quoted by the Dānasagara. Prof. Hazra's propositions that the Bhaviṣya (pp. 68-82) and Brahmapurāṇa (prosent) borrow from the Samba are not at all acceptable to the present author, parti cularly in view of his own admission (in 'Studies &o. vol. I, p. 68 ) that the present Sāmbapurāṇa consists of different units belonging to different climes and ages. All that can be said positively is that a purāṇa called Samba is mentioned by Alberuni in 1030 A. D. (Sachau I. p. 130 ).

Dr, Pusalkar in Studies in Epics and Puranag pp. 31-41 (holds that the printed Vāyu is a genuine Mahāpurāpa, that the Śivapurāṇa is a late work and is only an Upapurāṇa); the oldest datable reference to it is in Alberugi's work (vide Sachau, vol. 1. p. 131). It is quoted in the Danasāgara several times, but is not quoted in Kalpataru, Aparārka and Sm. O. It is divided into seven sambitās called Vidyasyara, Rudragamhita (in five parts called Sșsti, Sati, Pāryati, 1444a Kumāra, Yuddha ).

śkanda -- This is the most extensive of Purāṇas and pogos perplexing problems. It is found in two forms, one being divided into seven khandas, viz. Maheśvara, Vaiṣṇava, Brahma, Kāśī, Āvantya, Nāgara and Prabhāga, the other being divided into six samhitās, viz. Sanatkumāra, Sūta, Sārkarl, Vaiṣṇavi, Brāhmi and Saura. The Skanda in seven khandas has been published by the Venk, Press and the Sūtāsambitā with the commentary of Mādhavācārya has been published by the Anan. Prese, Poona. The extent of the Skanda is variously given as 81000 slokas, at 100000 slokas (vide PRHR p. 158), at 86000 (in PRHR p. 159). The god Skanda does not figure prominently in this Purāṇa named after him. The Skanda is named in the Padma V. 59. 2. Skanda I. 2. 6. 79 is almost in the same words as Kirātārjuniya 1415 (II. 30 sahasa vidadhita na kriyām). Skanda, Kāśikhanda 24 ( 8 ff) is full of Sloṣa and Parisankhya in the style of Bana as in 'yatra kṣa

papakā eva drøyante maladhāriṇaḥ' (verse 21) or 'vibhramo yatra nāriṣu na vidvatsu oa karbicit' (verge 9). Natyaveda and Artha gāstras are mentioned in Kāśikhanda (Pūrvārdha 7. 4-5), Dhan vantari and Caraka on medioine are mentioned in Kāśikhanda (Pārvārdha 1.71); the word Jhotinga occurs in Kāśikhanda 72.74 (Jhotingā rākṣasāḥ krūrāḥ). Skanda is quoted on topics of Dharmaśāstra in early commentaries and digests. The Mit on Yaj. 11. 290 mentions it in connection with the status of veśyās (courtozans). Kalpataru on vrata quotes only 15 vorges from it, Kalpataru on tirtha (pp. 36-39, 32, 46, 130-135 ) quotes 92 verses from it, on dāna only 44, on niyatakāla 63 verses, 18 verses on Rājadharma (on Kaumudimahotsava), only 4 in śrāddhakanda and 3 in gļhasthakāṇda. Aparārka 1446 quotes only 19 verses from it; one quotation indicates Tantrik 

influence (vide note). The Dānasāgara cites 48 verses on dana from it and the Sm. O. only 23 in all. Considering the colossal figure of slokas in the Skanda it must be said that it is rather sparingly quoted in the Dharmaśāstra works. A verse in it seems to echo the very words of Kālidāsa and quotes the view of Dovala.14460 In such a huge work interpolations could easily be made. So it is difficult to assign a definite date to it. A ms. of the Skanda in the Nepal Durbar Library is written in charac tors which belong to the 7th century A. D. according to Haraprasad Shastri (vide Cat, of Nepal Palm-leaf mass. p. LII.) 

It would be not far from the truth to say that the Skanda cannot be placed earlier than the 7th century A. D. and not later than 9th century A, D, on the evidence so far available.
