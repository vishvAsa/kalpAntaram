SECTION IV THE PURĀNAS AND DHARMAŚĀSTRA 

CHAPTER XXII Origin and development of Purāṇa literature 

The History of Dharmaśāstra (vol I pp. 160-167 ) has a hrief chapter on the Puranas. It has been shown tharsin how the Taittiriya Arapyaka, the Chandogya and Bṛbadaranyaka Upanisads mention Itihasa and Purana (sometimes callectively as 'Itihasapuradam' and sometimes separately as 'Itibasah Purāpam') and how some of the extant Parāṇas are minch varlier than the 6th century A.D. It is further pointed out there that the number of the principal Puranag has been traditionally handed down as eighteen, 324 that some para as much as the Matsya, the Vispu, the Vayu and Bhaviṣya contain mich Dharms śāstra material, that the Garuḍa-purana and the Aguipurna contain several bundred verses each that are identical with verste of the Yājñavalkya amrti, that there is great divergence as to the extent of almost all Purapas, that some of the Paranas that selves enumerate minor works called Upaparabas, that the Puranas are divided into three groups, vis sātlaku, rajasa and tāmasa (as done by Garuḍa L 223. 17-20, and Padma VL. 263. 81-84). Details were also farnished as to the chapters of the Puranas in which the several topics of Dharmasastra (ch as ācāra, āhnika, dana, röjadharma, fuddha, tirtha ) were dealt with 

In the present section it is proposed to trace the great trans formation that took place in the ideas, ideals and practicar of the ancient Indian people owing to the influence of the Pudimas in the first few centuries of the Christian

goes back much farther than was pointed out in the H. of DH. vol. I. p. 160. The Atharvaveda 1325 mentions Purāṇa (in the singular) in XI. 7. 24 and XV. 6. 10-11. The çk and saman verses, the chandas, the Purāṇa along with the Yajus formula, all sprang from the remainder of sacrificial food, ( as also ) the gods that resort to heaven. He changed his place and went over to great direction; and Itihasa and Purana, gathās, verses in praise of heroes followed in going over.' The Satapatha brahmana also (XI. 5. 6.8) mentions 'Itihasapuranam' (as one compound word) and states that on the 9th day of the Pāriplava the hott priest instructs among other matters as follows: 'The Purāṇa is the Veda; this it is ; thus saying let him narrate some Purana ' (XIII 4. 3. 13.). 1326 The Saṅkhayana tan Srautasutra (XVI. 2.27) and the Aivalayana rauta (X.7) remark that on two days of the Pāriplava the Itihāsaveda and Purāṇaveda were to be recited. But the two sūtras ( though affiliated to the Rgveda ) differ as to the day on which they were to be recited. It is difficult to say whether the Atharvaveda, the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Upaniṣads know several works called Purāṇa or whether there was only a single work called

Purana kaowo to tham. But from the fact that the Tai. Ar (II. 10) speaks of Itihasas and Puranas ( in the plural) i mogli not be unreasonable to suppose that in the latar Vadio period least some works (three or more) callad Puranas cisted and were studied and recited by those that were engaged in solana sacrifices like the Aśramedha. It is not unlikely that, whare the singular Purāṇam' was employed in the Vedic texte, s class of works was meant. The facts that Ibihass-Purāpa' is called the fifth Voda in the Upanisads and that the Satapatha employs Itibāsa-Purāṇamas one compound word bead to the inference that the two categories Itihase' and 'Purana' more similar in contents at least in several respects. The Apestambo dharmasūtra 1328 quotes two vorses each in two places from a Purana ( in the singular ), once cites the view of the Bhaviṣyat purāpa and in another place gives the summary of a Purana passage or verse which says that, whan 8 person attacks another

with the object of harming him and the person attacked kills the attaoker, no sin is incurred. From these passages it is clear that Apastamba had before him a Purāṇa called Bhaviṣyat and also that the Purana or Purāṇas which he knew contained rules about the food to be accepted for eating, about the stages of householder and the perpetual student, about resisting an ātatāyin oven unto death and about creation and re-creation after dissolution. These matters fall within the province of Smrtis and Purāṇas. As the word 'purāṇa' means 'ancient', the word Bhaviṣyat-purāṇa is a contradiotion in terms. Long before Āpastamba the word Purāṇa had come to mean a work dealing with ancient tales &o; several such works must have been composed and they probably began to incorporate contem porary events and wrote about such events in a prophetio vein. Hence arose the name Bhaviṣyat-purāṇa. 2329 As Apastambe mentions a Bhaviṣyat-purāṇa and also Purāṇa, it follows that before 500 B. C. several Purāpas existed one of which was called the Bhaviṣyat and the Purāṇas then known contained the topics of sarga, pratisarga and smrti matters. 

This conclusion is strongly corroborated by other facts. The Gautama-dharmasūtra provides that a learned (bahusruta) brahmana is one who knows peoples' usages, the Veda, the angas (auxiliary lorës), Vākovākya (dialogues), Itihāsa and Purāṇa and that the king in administering the affairs of his kingdom and justice has to depend upon the Veda, Dharmasastra, the (six) angas of the Veda, the (four) Upavadas and Purāṇa. 1330 

From the above discussion it appears that, though we are not in a position to make definite statements about the contents of the Purāṇa or Purāṇas referred to in the Atharva, Sat. Br., Tai. Ār. and the Upaniṣads, by the time of Āp. and Gautama, Purāpas approaching in contents to some extent at least some of the extant Purāṇas had come into existence. The

The reference sbows that (lo 177. 54-57) Simba, son of Krṣqa, renovated the Purāṇa called Bhaviṣyat and established images of the Sun-god in four places viz. (1) to the south of the Yamunā, (2) between Yamunā and Multan, called Kālapriya, (3) at Mūlastbāna (modern Multan). (4) in Mathura; vide Bhaviṣya (Venk. ed.) 1. 72. 4-7 for thres centres of the Sun image. The Matsya 53, 62 also mentions the Bhaviṣgat.

Purina in Kautilya 

Artbaśistia of Kantilya states that the trayi' means the targa Vedas, Ti Simayeda, Rorede, Yajurveda apd that the Atharvad reda and Itihasayeda aro (alao) vedas'. I follow the in Kautilya's time Itihasa was a definite wack like the tree redes In another place Kantilya provides 'a minister proficient in Arthaśāstras and bent on the good of the king should, by means of itiyrtta (bistory or bistorical accutan.CBS) and Puranea, admonish (and bring to the right path) & king led astray by other guides,' In laying down a time-table for the king's daily routine of work, w Kantilya provides that in the latter part of the day the king should listen to Itihasa and defines the latter as comprehending Puraga, itirrtia, akhyāyla (narrations) adabaraga (haroic examples), Dharmasastra and Arthasastra (science of government and statecraft). It appears that Katilya meant by 'Itihasa' a Mahābharata mare a legis very like the extant one, which describes 153 itself as the best of itihast, a & Dharmaśāstra, Arthaśāstra, Kāmaśāstra and as Karsrapoda Anong the officials 134 to be maintained by the king with salvia are mentioned astrologers, persons conversant with portanta and anspicious tirces, Paurapita, Sūts and Māgacha, who were to be paid 1000 (papas) as salary.

Manusmrti 1336 provides that in a sraddha rite the brahmaṇas invited for dinner should recite the Vedas, the Dharmadāstras, stories, Itihāsas, Puranas and khila hymns (such as Srigūkta), it should be taken as referring to Purāṇa works closely resembl ing the extant ones. The Yājñavalkya1337 smrti enumeratos the fourteen Vidyāsthānas (branches of knowledge) and sources of dharma as Purāṇa, Nyāya (logic), Mināmsā (rules of Vedic interpretation), Dharmaśāstras, the angas of the Veda and the (four) Vedas. These fourteen are probably arranged in the order of importance and authoritativeness at the time of the Yājāavalkya-smrti. Yāj. refers to sages that expounded or promulgated the Vedas, Purāṇas, the vidyās (six angas), the Upaniṣads, the slokas (itihāga?), aphoristic works (like those of Jaimini or on nyāya), the bhāsyas and whatever other literature exists. In another place Yāj. recommends that a householder after a bath in the morning and worship of gods and pitṛs should engage in japa-yajās, in which he should mutter according to his ability parts of the Veda, of Atharvaveda, Itibāga and Puranas and philosophical texts. These passages from Yājña valkya establish that Itibāsa and Purana went together, that both were works distinct from Vedic Literature and that both had attained a status of sacredness and authoritativeness in matters of dharma in the time of the Yājñavalkya-smrti not later than 3rd century (A. D.). A Vārtika mentioned by the Mahābhāṣya on Pāe IV. 2. 59-60 provides for the formation of words with the affix' thak' (ika) in the case of akhyāna (auch as Yāvakritika, Yāyātika), ākhyāyikā (such as Vasavadattika, Saumanottarika), itihāsa (aitibāsika), Purāṇa (paurāṇika) in the sense of one who studies or knows that. 1338 In numerous passages the Mahābhārata mentions Purāṇa in the singular

B It is impossible to hold that all the numerous references to Puranas are later interpolations, though a few may be go. It is not correct to say that no Purāṇa resembling the extant ones existed before the time when Purāṇa stories were collected in the Maha bharata. There is hardly any evidence to support any such view. 

Early Sanskrit authors like Bapa (first half of 7th century A D.) and commentators like Sabara (not later than between 200-400 A. D.), Kumārila (7th century A. D.), Saṅkarācārya (between 650-800 A. D.) and Viśvarūpa (800-850 A. D.) leave us in no doubt that in their times Purāpas existed, the contents of which were just like those of the extant Purāṇas. Sabara in his bhāsya 1341 on Jaimini X. 4. 23, while discussing the question as to what is meant by devata in relation to sacrifices, states that one view was that they are agai and others, that are described in the Itihāsa and Puranas as dwelling in heaven. Bāpa in his Kadambari and Harsacarita frequently refers to the Mahābhārata &rd Parapas, but two passages from the Kādambari and one from the Harṣacarita are very interesting. While describing the hermitage of the sage Jabali Baña employs a $leṣa "there was Vāyupralapita (proclaiming by god Vāya; babbling due to the windy bumour) in Purana (but no babbling in the hermitage ) 1342.

cription of the palace of Tārāpida Bāpe employs & śleṣa ( double extendre) comparing it with Purāṇa (the two meanings being 'where the accumulated wealth of the world was arranged in appropriate groups', 'in which there is a description of the whole sphere of worlds each part of which was assigned a proper division'). In the Uttarabhāga (by the son of Bāpa) of the Kadambari it is stated that in all āgamas (sacred works tradition ally handed down) such as Purāṇas, Rāmāyana and Bhārata thore are many stories about curses. The placing of Purāpas first shows that they were probably more honoured or popular than the Rāmāyaṇa and the Bhārata. In the Harṣacarita 1343 it is stated that the book-roader Sudrsṭi treated Bana and his relatives and friends to a musical recitation of the Purāpa promulgated by Vāyu, that was sung by the sage (Vyāsa), that is very exten give, that is world-wide (ie, known everywhere), that is holy and that is not different from the career of Harṣa ( to which also all the adjectives applied to the Purāṇa are applicable). Here it appears that the Vāyu is expressly mentioned (as Pava mānaprokta and Pūrana) and it is further stated that the Puranas contained a description of the several divisions of the world. This description applies to such Purāpas as the Vayu, Matsya (chapters 114-128), Brabmaṇda (II. 15 ff). It may be argued that the Purāṇa mentioned by Bāna may be the Brah mānda since that Purāṇa says 1343, in the beginning as well as at the end (IV. 4. 58ff) that Brahmā impartod it to Vāyu, from whom it passed on to several divine and semi-divine personages and ultimately sūta received it from Vyāsa. This latter argu ment is not acceptable, since there was nothing to prevent Bana from expressly saying that the Brahmānda was the Purāṇa recited by Sudrsti.

Kumarila and Puranas 

Kumārlabhatte in his Tantravāztika refers in several places to the Puranas and their contente. A fee interesting passages are set out here: On Jaimini 13,1 Kumirila sy $34 

• Therefore the authoritativeness of all smrtis is stablished by the purpose which they serve; whatever therein (in smitis) in connected with dharma and moka (is authoritative), becarise it springs from (is based on the Veda; whatever concerns wealth (artha ) and pleasures is based on the usage of the people. In this way a distinction is to be made. Thk yezy reasoning applies to hortatory passages in the Itzhost and Purinas. The Upākhyānas may be explained by the reasoning applicable to arthavādas (i. e. they have a purpose and antiarita tiveness just like the commendatory passages of the Veda). Narration of the divisions of the earth serves the purpose of distinguishing the regions for undergoing the consequence of the (actions that are the ) means of tharma and adharma and are partly based on personal experience and partly on the Veda. The orderly presentation of variśas (dynasties) in the Puridas is intended to facilitate the knowledge of the brabrapa and ksatriya castes and their gotras and is based on actual experi ence and traditional knowledge; countries and measures of times are intended to facilitate worldly transactions and astronomnical Deeds and are based on actual perception, mathematian tradition and inference. The narration of wbat will happen in the future is based on the Veda, since it conveys knowledge of the variety of the ripening of the consequences of (complying with) dharna and of adharma and knowledge of the characteristics of fugas that have been in operation from time immemorial" is clear from this passage that the Itibāsa and the Parasas that Kumārila kney contained stories, geography of the eartta dynastic liste, measures of time and description of what will happen in the future.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Soo. IV, Ch. XXII 

Purāṇas 1345 it is narrated that in the Kali age there will arise Śakya (Gautama Buddha) and others that will cause confusion about dharma; who would listen to their worda ?' This shows that before the 7th century A. D. the Purāṇas contained descrip tions of the nature of Kaliyuga and that the Purāṇas Kumārila knew did not regard Buddha as an avatāra of Viṣṇu, but rather condemned him. From the facts that Kṣemendra composed his Daśāvatāracarita in 1066 A. D., that Aparārka (on p. 338 ) quotes a long passage from the Matsya chapter 285, verse seven of which enumerates the ton avatāras of Viṣou (including Buddha), and that the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva regards Buddha as an avatāra, it follows that before 1000 A. D. Buddha bad come to be regarded as an avatāra of Viṣṇu, though before the 7th century some Purāṇas at least had condemned him. In the discussion of the meaning of the word 'svarga' 134 Kumārila asks: does it mean the region of the stars or does it mean the top of the Meru (mountain) in conformity with Itihāsa and Purāṇas or does it mean only a state of happiness? This indicates that in Kumārila's day Purāṇas contained descriptions of the top of Moru as 'heaven.' 

Saṅkarācārya in his bhāsya on the Vedāntasūtra frequently mentions the contents and characteristic features of Purāṇas that are the same as those of the extant ones, though he actually names none of them. For example, on V.S. IL 1. 36 he remarks that it has been established in the Purāṇa that there is no limit to the number of past and futuro 1347 kalpas. On V. 8. I. 3.30.

I. 3.7; some of the Parāṇas such as Varība 113. 27-28, Brabma 122. 68-70, Padma VI, 31. 13-15 mention the ten avatāras of Viṣṇu (including Buddha). But these Puranas have been swollen by late interpolations and it is impossible to give a positive date for these passages,

the Acarya quotes two verses that he designates ag smrti, that are Viṣṇupurana15.59-60, but are not tound in ancient smrtis like those of Manu or Yaj. On v.S.III. 1. 15 (apics sapta) the bhāsya remarks that those who have studied or who know the Puranas declare that there are seven holla, Raurava and others, that are regarded as places reached for undergoing the con sequences of evil deeds committed by sinners The Visruparāža enumerates seven hells viz. Tāmisra, Raurava and others, as the places for those who abuse the Veda, who canzse obstacles to sacrifices and who give up their proper dharma Lyen Hand (IV.87-90),Yaj.

II. 1. 1, Saṅkarācārya quotes a verse which is the same in Vāyupurāṇa and on I. 3, 30 quotes in al five verses as smrti, four of which are the same as Vayu9.57-58 and 64-65.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Beo. IV, Ch. XXII 

remarks that this theory ooncerning the creation and dissolution of the world is found everywhere in the Puranas. On Yaj. III. 175 which states that the path to the world of the pitȚs lios between the star Agastya (Canopus) and the Ajavithi, Viśvarūpa remarks that in the Purāṇa several vithis ( i. e. Courses ) of the Sun in the sky are found and that Ajavithi is immediately contiguous to Agastya. 

From the foregoing discussion about the references to Puranas contained in writers from Sabara to Viśvarūpa it follows that between about the 2nd century AD, and the 6th or 7th century AD. the Purāṇas exhibited the same contents and characteristics as many of the extant Purāṇas do. 

Before proceeding further, it is necessary to say here some thing about the Yuga-purāṇa, a part of the Gārgi-Samhitā, and one of the earliest extant works bearing the title Purāṇas. Kern in his Introduction to the Bṭhatsambitā (pp. 32-40 ) brought this rare Purāṇa containing valuable historical data to the notice of scholars from a fragmentary ms. Later on K. P. Jayaswal 1348, published a text of the purely historical material of the Yugapurāṇa in 115 half lines in Anustubh metre based on the fragment that Kern had got and two more mss. that were secured by him and added a translation and notes. Later on Jayaswal obtained a copy made by Prof. Levi from a ms, (in Bengali script) in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris and published in JBORS. (vol. XV pp. 129-133) a table comparing the readings of that ms with the text he published in JBORS. vol. XIV. Prof. K. H. Dhruva contributed a paper on the text of the Yugapurāṇa to the JBORS. vol. XVI. pp. 18-66, wherein he altered the proper names and gave free scope to his con jectures and inforences with the result that succeeding scholars have not attached any weight to his emendations and remarks, Prof. D. K. Mankad 13485 published & monograph in which he gave the text of the historical portion based on the mss. utilized

The Yugapuraza

by Jayaswal and a fresh mus. that he obtained in Saurastra, corrects some of the readings accepted by Jayaswal and considerably differs from some of Jayaswal's interpretations and added a few notes. 

The Yugapurapa is the 113th chapter of Gārglsarbitā and is called Skandaparāṇa in the ms, secured by Prof. Mankad, probably because the Purāṇa starts with a question by Skanda to Śiva about the characteristics of the different yugas.. The characteristics of Kṛta, Treta and Dvāpara are regpactively described in lines 11-28, 29-45 and 46–74 of Prof. Mankad's text; and lines 75-235 (of Prof. Mankad's text) and lines 1-115 of Jayaswal's text ( in JBORS. vol. XIV. pp. 400-408) describe the characteristics of the Kaliyuga, and the political, social and economic history of a few centuries before the work was con posed. The characteristics of the Kaliyuga in the Yugapurang bear a very close resemblance to the description of Kaliyuga in the Vanaparva (chap. 188. 30-64), one half verse being the same in both 13c 

The important points that emerge are briefly these: Ionit the discussion of different interpretations of Jayasval, Prof. Mankad and Prof. Narain. Kaliyuga started after Draupadi died. In the beginning of Kaliyuga Janamejaya, son of Packsit, would be a famous king but will come in conflict 13that with brāhmaṇas. In Kaliyuga, Udayi son of Siśudāga, vil found the city of Pataliputra on the south bank of the Ganges, which will come to be called Puspapira and which will last for five thousand, five hundred and five years, five months, five days and five muhurtas. In that Puspapara there will be a deluded and wicked king called sāliśāka who will establish at Saketa his virtuous elder brother named Vijaya Then the valiant Yavanas,

Pancalas and Mathuras will attack Sāketa and will conquer Kusumapura which had a mud fortification. All countries will be disturbed (by this onslaught of the Yavanas). Then non Aryans will follow the practices of the Aryas. At the end of Kali age brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaiśyas will dress alike and have the same practices. People will join heretical sects and will make friends for ( seducing their ) vives. Sūdras will offer oblations into fire with the syllable 'om' and they will address (Others) with the word 'bhoh' and brāhmaṇas will address otherg with the words "O aryas'. The Yavanas will establish five kings in the city (of Puṣpapura). The Yavanas will not stay long in Madhyadeśa. When the Yavanas will vanish there will be Boven powerful kings at Sākota; in Madhyadeśa there would be bloody wars. All the Āgniveśya kings will perish by war and 80 will the people. 

Thereafter the greedy Saka king will undergo destruction against Sata, the king of Kalinga, and the earth will be devast ated and Puspapura will be a wilderness. Amlāta called 'red. eyed' will secure Puṣpapura. The Mleccha king Amlāta will destroy the helpless people and the four varṇas. Amlāta with his relatives will perish and then there will be a king called Gopala who will rule one year and then die. There will then be the just king called Pusyaka who will rule only one year. After two more kings, Agnimitra will be king who will wage a terrible battle with brāhmapas for a girl. After him his son will rule for 20 years. The condition of the people will be very bad because of his fight with Sabarag. Then Sātu king will rule. Then there will be depredations of Sakas who will destroy One-fourth of the population and make the people demoralised, In this way the Yugapurāpa ends on a dismal note.1348 e 

As the Purana stops with the Sakas and does not dilate on the dynasties of the Andhras, Abhiras and Guptas, it must be placed earlier than all the known Purāṇas which deal with these dynasties. Jayaswal places the Yugapurāṇa in the latter half of the first century B. C. In the opinion of the present author he is right.

A very recent work "The Indo-Grooke' by Prof. A. K. Narain (Oxford, 1957) bas an illuminating note (pp. 174–179) on several difficult passages of the Yugapurana 1348. ; 

Several Puranas such as Matsya 53.3-11, Vāyu 1.60-61, Brahmāṇda I 1.40-41, Liiga I. 2.2, Nāradiya I 92.22-26, Padma V. 1. 45-52 state that Purana 138 was originally only one, that Brahmā thought of it first, that after that the Vedas proceeded from Brahma's lips, that originally it had the extent of one hundred crores of ślokas and that the essence thereof to the e tent of four lakhs of verses was declared in each Dvāpara age by Vyāsa. It is impossible to say whether the writers of the entant Purāṇas had any ancient tradition about this before them a whether all this about the original existence of a single Parapa was purely imaginary. The author bolds that the latter vier 

is more likely to be the correct one. It has been shown above that as early as the Taittiriya Ārapyaka Purāṇas are mentioned in the plural. Therefore, the extant Puranas are only the successors of the ancient Puranas, about which, it must be admitted, we know very little. 

The number of Puranas (in later times and by some of the Puranas distinguished as Mabāpuradas) has been traditionally handed down as eighteen. They are enumarated in several Puranas, such as Vispu III. 6. 21-23, Varāha 112,69-72 ( Yerses 74-77 in Venk. ed.), Linga I. 39. 61-63, Mataya 53.11 , Padus IV. 100. 51-54, Bhaviṣya I L 61-64.

Agai 272, Bhāgavata 1350 XII. 13. 4-8, Vāyu 1351 104. 2-10, Skanda (Prabhāsakhapda %. 5-7). There is some difference. about the 18 names and great difference as to their extent and contents. The Matsya (53. 18-19), Agni 272. 4-5, Nāradiya I. 92. 26-28 enumerate the Vayu as the 4th among the 18 Purāṇas, while most of the others substitute Śivapurāṇa as the 4th in place of the Vāyu. The Skanda (in Prabhāsakhapda 2.5 and 7) puts Śaiva as the 4th in place of Vāyu and Vayaviya as the last (probably meaning Brahmānda thereby). The Devibhāgavata1352 contains a verso naming the 18 Purāpas by their first letters in which the Śivapurana is omitted. The Saurapurāṇa (chap. 9. 5-12) enumerates the 18 Purāpas, places Vāyu as the 4th (and not siya) and Brahmānda as the last. The Sūtasamhita (I 1. 7-11) games the 18 Purāṇas omitting Vāyu and putting Śiva. purāṇa in its place. The Dānasāgara in its Introductory Verses (11-12 on pp. 2–3) mentions both Vāyaviya and Śaiva separately, In the verses of the Kālikā-purāpā quoted by Hemādri on dāna 1. p. 531, Śiva, Kālikā, Saura and Vabnija (Āgneya, the genuine one) are included among eighteen principal Purāṇas. On the whole I agree with Dr. A. D. Pusalkar 1353 that it is the Vāyu that is entitled to be regarded as one of the 18 principal Purāṇas and not the sivapurāṇa. Al-beruni in his work on India (com.

D.) sets out one list of Purāṇas as read out to him from Viṣṇupurāne, which is the same as set out below, except this that the Śaiva-purana is put in the 4th place instead of Vayı (Sachau's tr, vol. I p. 131, ed of 1888). It is clear, therefore, that the list of 18 principal Purāpas had boon completed long before 1000 A. D. and was introduced in the Viṣṇupurāns many years before that date. Alberoni furnishes (ibid p. 130) another list of the names of 18 Puraṇas which he had heard, viz. Adi, Matsya, Kūrma, Varāba, Narasimha, Vāmana, Vāyu, Nanda, Skanda, Aditya, Soma, Samba, Brahmānda, Mārkandeya, Tārksys (ie. Garuḍa ), Viṣṇu, Brahma, Bhavisy. It should be noticed that in this list Vāyu is included (and not Śaiva), that some puranas described in other works as Upapurāṇas are included (viz. Adi, Narasimha, Nanda, Aditya, Soma and Samba) and some works almost on animously declared to be Mahāparāṇas ( such as Padma, Bhagan vata, Nārada, Agni, Linga and Brahmavaivarta ) are omitted, It follows that some upapurāṇas such as Adi, Narasimha, Aditya, Sāmba, Nanda (Nandi?) had been composed at least some time before 1000 A. D. Balambhatta (latter half of 18th century A. D.) states in his commentary on the Mitaksarā (on Yāj. 13) that the Vayaviya-purāṇa is also called Saiya.

It will be noticed from the table that the total number of verses in the 18 Purāṇas according to the figures furnished by most Purāpas comes to 400600 slokas. This closely agrees with 

the total of four lakhs assigned to the eighteen Purāpas in some of the Purāṇas (vide note 1349 above). But several of the extant Purāpas contain much smaller numbers of slokas than are assigned to them. For example, it appears from the com mentaries called Viṣṇucitti 1354 and Vaiṣṇavākūtācandrikā on

Similarly, the extent of the Kurms is said to be 17000 or 18000 slokas by most of the Purāṇas that furnish the extent of Puranas, but the extant Kurma has hardly 6000 slokas. The Brabma contains 10000 slokas according to the Nāradiya and 25000 socording to the Agni, but the printed Brahma (of the Anandisrama ed.) contains about 14000 verses. On the other hand, the Skanda (that has two recensions at present) is said to contain 81000 ślokas, but the Skanda 'printed by the Venk. Press contains several thousands more. The Bhaviṣya (Brahmaparva) is states that all Puranas had originally 12000 varses each, but their extent increased by the addition of tales, so that the Skanda was inflated to the extent of one lakh of ślakas and the Bhaviṣya to 50000 slokas. The order in which the Puranas are enumerated is not quite uniform. Most Purāṇas part the Brāhma in 1356 the first place and set out the order as in the table above, yet the Vayu (104.3) and the Devibhagarata (L3.3) begin the list of Purāpas with Matsya. The Skanda (Prabhasa khanda 2.8-9) puts the Brahmanda in the first place. The Bhagavata (XII. 7.23-24) enumerates the eighteen Puranas ia & somewhat different order. The Vamana 1357 regards the

History of Dharmasastra [sec. IV, On. XXII 

Matsya as the foremost among Puranas.) Notices of the contents of all the 18 Puranas occur in Matsya ( chap. 53 ), Agni (chap. 272), Skanda (Prabhāsakhanda 2. 28-76), Nāradiya (which devotes 18 chapters from I 92. 30-43 to I. 109 to the contents of 18 Purāṇas from Brahma to Brahmānda ). There is almost complete agreement among the Purāpas as to the names of the 18 principal Purāṇas, except as to the Vāyupurāṇa. 

The question about the Purāṇas is further complicated by the fact that some of the Purāpas themselves mention the names of a number of Upapurāṇas, though others ignore them. For example, the Matsya ( 53. 59-62 ) names the Narasimha, the Nandi, the Aditya and Samba as Upapurāṇas and appears to say that the Narasimha extended to 18000 ślokas and elaborated the description of the Man-Lion avatāra declared in the Padma purāṇa. The Kūrma (I. 1. 16-20 ), Padma (IV. 111. 95-98 ), the Devibhagavata (I. 3. 13-16) set out the names of eighteen Upapurāṇas. Some of the Upapurāṇas bear the same names as those of the principal purāṇas, viz. Skanda, Vāmana, Brahmānda and Nāradiya. Prof. Hazra 1358 states that the number of Upa purāṇas is 100. Only a few of the Upapurāṇas have been published and those published do not differ much in the matter of subjects from some of the principal purāṇas and almost all belie the definition of Purāṇa as pancalaksana'. It has been seen above ( note 1349 ) that the number of slokas in the 18 principal Puranas is said to be four lakhs. It must be remem bered that this total does not include the number of the slokas assigned to the Upapurāṇas, and no Purāpa includes the perses of the Upapurāṇas in the total of four lakhs. Further, no one should forget or ignore the significance of the remarks of the

I have, tberefore, been compelled to add only a few matters from this work, mostly in the footnotes.

I. p. 163 gives the names of the 18 Upapuraṇas as contained in the Garoda I. 223. 17-20. Hemādri on Vrata ( part 1. p. 21) sets out the names of the 18 Upaporāṇas from the Kūrma I, 1, 16-20 (with readings different from those of the printed Kūrma, some of which are rather serious ).

Matsya and Kārma about the Upapuripal. The Matsya 1389 speaks of the Upapurāṇas da sub-sections (upabhedas) of the principal eighteen Purāṇas and emphatically asserta 'know that whatever is declared as distinct from the eighteen Puranag came forth ( or issued from ) these (18). The Kūrma is no less clear. It states that 1360 the Upapurāṇas are the summaries or abridgments of the 18 (principal) Puranas made by sages after studying them. The lists of Upapurāṇas given by several works, most of which are set out by Prof. Hasra in his paper on Upaparāgas (in ABORI vol. XXI at pp. 40-48) and in his Studies (pp. 4-13) diverge a good deal from each other. As the Matsya mentions by name only four Upapurāgas it is not unreasonable to hold that more than four were not in existence at the time when this passage of the Matsys was inserted in it or at least that more than four bad not been accepted as Upaparānas at that time. A good many of the Upapurāṇas are of late date. Only a few of the rest such as the Narasimha, the Viṣṇu

History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. IV, Oh. XXII dharmottara, the Dovl, can possibly be held to be as old as the 7th or 8th century A.D. I do not accept the view of Prof. Hazra, who places the period of the formation of the group of eighteen Upapurāṇas between 650-800 A.D. (in ABORI. vol. XXI at p.50 and also in' Studies in Upapurāṇas 'vol. I. by Dr. Hazra ), where while admitting (p. 14 ) that in the Upapurāpa litarature there are works of comparatively late dates, be boldly states that the age of the Upapurāṇas began approximately from the Gupta period (p. 16). For this last statement there is absolutely no evidence whatever. A detailed discussion of the dates of all the Upapurāṇas would demand a large space and would be some what irrelevant in this section. We must hold fast by the facts that even when the 18 principal purāṇas assumed their present form, the number of Upapurāpas was small, that they were looked upon as no more than abridgments or sum maries of the principal Purāṇas, that the Puranas that mention upapurāpas do not state that they were composed by the divinely inspired Vyāsa (but only by some bages as the Kūrma says) and that originally they had not the status or authority of the 18 purāṇas. The Saura, an Upapurāṇa itself, speaks of Upapu rānas as kchilas (9.5). It is only the late medieval digesta like the Smrtitattva (1520–1570 A. D.) or the Viramitrodaya (first half of 17th century) that were separated by several centuries from the Mahapurāṇas as well as the Upapurāṇas and the writers of which had practically lost all sense of the distance in time between the two sets of Purāṇas, that say that the mention of Purāṇas 1361 as a source of dharma in Yāj. must be deemed to include Upapurāṇas also. This last may be the opinion of such late writers as Mitramiśra, but no scholar is bound to accept it. It is doubtful whether by the word Purāṇa, Yāj. refers to the Mahāpurāṇas now extant and whether he knows that there were eighteen of them. If some Upapurāṇas glorify themselves as of equal authority with the Mahāpurāṇas, that is of a piece with what the principal Purāṇas state about themselves viz. that Brahmā first thought of the Purānes and then the Vedas issued from his lips. Modern scholars should discount all these attempts at self-glorification. Upapurāṇas are due to sages. Upapurāpas are distinguished from Purāṇas in several important respecta. Firstly, the 18 purāpas are attributed to the semi-divine Vyāsa; secondly, according to both Matsya and Kurma, they were summaries of the Purāṇas; thirdly, the slokas in the '. 1361. एतान्युपपुराणानि पुराणेग्यो निर्गतानीति याज्ञवल्क्येन पुराणलेन समाधीतानि । 

ANT4** (of efter staa) p. 14, 

Upapurāpas distinguished from Purīnas 837 Upapurśnas are not included in the 4 lakhs of verses of all the Purāṇas together; fourthly, early commentators and nibandha writers like the Mitakṣarā and the Kṛtyakalpataru either do not mention any of the Upapurāṇas or at the most only about half a dozen or so and that too rather sparingly; and lastly, as Prof. Hazra himself asserts ("Studies', vol. I. p. 23) adherents of various seots such as Sāktas, Sauras, Pancarātras interpolated chapters in the Purāṇas of the established group and in some cases wrote new and independent works to propagate their own ideas and styled them Purāṇas. 

Early commentaries and digests of Dharmağastra very rarely refer to any of the well-known Upapurāṇas. The Mita kṣarā, though it names the Brāhma (on Yāj. I3 and 45), quotes passages from the Matsya ( profusely ), Vispu (on Yāj. III 6), Skanda (on Yāj. III. 290), Bhaviṣya (on Yāj. III, 6), Mārkan deya (on Yaj. I. 236, 254, ILL. 19, 287, 289 ) and Brahmanda (on Yāj. III, 30), hardly refers, so far as I know, to any UpapurāṇaThe Kṛtyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara (composed about 1110-1130 A. D.), twelve parts of which published in the G.O. 8 cover several thousand pages, profusely quotes many of the Mabāpurāṇas, and only six of the Upapurāṇas by name, viz. Adi (only twice on suddhi), Nandi (profusely only on dāna and niyatakālika), Aditya, Kālikā, Devi, Narasimha (all four profusely on several topics). Aparārka (first half of 12th century A, D.) who quotes profusely from Brahma, Brahmānda, Bhaviṣyat, Mārkandeya, Vāyu, Viṣṇu and Matsya quotes by name only the following Upapurāṇas and only sparingly viz. Adi, Aditya, Kalikā, Devi, Nandi, Nrsimha, Viṣṇudharmottara ( seven times ), Viṣṇurahasya ( once ), and Śivadharmottara (once ). / The Dānasāgara 1.62 (written in 1169) states Upa purāṇas have been promulgated, which clearly set out the procedure of gifts' and it expressly mentions as Upapuriṇas dealing with gifts the Ādya (Adi or Brahma?), Aditya, Kālikā, Nandi, Narasimha, Markandeya, Viṣṇudharmottara and Samba and remarks that the Viṣṇurahasya and Śivarahasya are merely compilations (sangraharūpa). It is not necessary to refer to writers later than about 1170 A, D, in the matter of Upapurāṇasi

them naturally lead to the inference that these passages were added some time after all the eighteen Purāṇas segumed & complete form. It is not possible to hold that all the main purāṇas were composed at the same time by one individual author or even by several contemporary writers. Besides, most of the editions of Puranas are based either on a single ms. or on a fow mss. collected at random and are not critically edited as is the case with the critical edition of the Mahabhārata published in Poona by the B.O.R. I. Many conclusions there. fore, drawn from the current printed editions of the Purāṇas or from msg. of the Puranas, must be regarded as merely tentative and as likely to turn out to be wrong. What Winternitz said in his History of Indian Literature (English translation, Calcutta, vol. I. p. 469) viz 'that the date of each section, day, sometimes of each single verse in the Mabābhārata must be determined separately applies with equal (or perhaps greater) force to the Purāṇas, perticularly when one wants to use the section or stanza for historical or comparative purposes.1363 

It may be conceded that the Puranas and some of the avail. able Upapurāṇas also contain many ancient legends and tradi tions; but these have been so much tampered with and inflated by additions intended to bolster up particular forms of worship and particular tenets that great caution is required before one can recognize them as genuine and reliable representatives for ascertaining the general state of Indian society and beliefs in ancient and medieval times. 

In the opinion of the present writer there is no positive objective evidence for placing any of the upapurāṇas except the Viṣṇudbarmottara before the 8th or 9th century A. D. Even in the case of Purāṇas, there have been large interpolations such as verses about the 18 purāṇas, their number and contents. But they contain much ancient material and are far more reliable than most of the Upapurāṇas, having been quoted by writers from 8th and 9th centuries A, D. Or even earlier. 

The Amarakosa 1364 defines Itihasa' as 'what happoned in the past' and 'Purana' as 'what has five signs or characteristics'. It is no doubt true that some purāṇas speak of Purāṇa as

The Bhagavata 1366 states that ten topics are dealt with by Purāṇas and that some say that they are only five. The ten topics of the Bhagavata are garga, visarga ( dissolution or cred tion after destruction), vrtti (modes of subsistence, natural or prescribed for all men by śāstra), raksā (protection i. e, avatāras destroying those that hate the Vedas), antarani (i e, manya taras), vamsa, vamsyanucarita, sanstha (four kinds of laya), hetu (the cause of creation viz. the soul that is subject to avidya and collects karma), apasraya (the refuge of individual souls, viz. brahman). The Matsyapurāṇa also mentions other charac teristics of Puranas viz. in all Parāṇas the four goals of man (puruṣarthas) are described, also the consequences of doing what is opposed to dharma, division of Purāṇas into sāttrika, rājası, tāmasa, the sāttvika and rajasa purāpas respectively extolling the greatness of Hari and Brahmā, tāmasa Puranas extolling Agni and Śiva, the mixed ones extolling the greatness of Sarasvati and pitrs. The questions addressed by Manu to Kesaya (in Matsya 2. 22-24) indicate the subjects that wonld be dealt with by that Purāpa viz. creation and dissolution, the ramsas,

manvantaras, vaidyacarita, the expanse of the world, rulos about danas, śrāddha, varṇas and aśramas, ista and purta, establishment of images of gods, and everything else. 

It is not quite clear why the Amarakośa seized upon the above mentioned five topics as characteristics of Purāpas Amarakośa 1367 cannot be placed later than the 5th century A. D. It is likely that before that time the number of Purāpas was not large, that they had not become very inflated, and that, as Itihāsa and Purāṇa were often lumped together as the 5th Veda in the Upaniṣads, they both bad certain matters in common. Itihasa did not probably deal with creation, dissolution and manvastaras, but contented itself with the dynasties of kings and with the deeds and legends about the heroes of the past. Rarely, Itihāsa (Mahābhārata) is called Purāṇa and some extant Purāṇas describe themselves as Itibāsa. For example, the Vāgu 1368 calls itself in the same context both itibāsa and purāṇa. The Brabmapurāṇa calls itself Purāṇa as well as ākhyāna (245, 27 and 30). The Mahābhārata 1369, though generally called itibāsa by itaelf (as in Adi 1. 19, 26, 54 ) or the best of itihāsas, still applies to itself the words. 'ākhyāna 1370 (as in Adi 2. 388 89), Kavya (Adi 2. 390), Kārṣpaveda (Ādi 1. 264) and Purana (Adi 1. 17). From this it appears that originally the line of demarcation between the two was rather thin. lo defining Purāpa as 'pañcalaksana' the Amarakośa and some of the Purāṇas seized upon such topics as distinguished Purāṇas from Itihāsa and other branches of Sanskrit literature.

What Purūnas contained in Apostamba's day 841 shown above that the Purana and Bhaviṣyatpurāṇa that existed before Āpastamba contained not only sarga and pratisarga but . also some smrti materials as well. From the definition given in the Purāṇas and the Amarakośa it does not at all follow that those five topics alone were the constituent parts of the very ancient Purāṇas, as Kirfel holds; 1371 What could be said at the most is that five were the distinctive topics that differentiated the Purāpa class of works from other branches of literature and probably cognate works called Itihasa or it may be that the five are generalized as an ideal for Puranas and that the very early representatives of this class (that existed before Ap. Dh. 8.) had not these five as characteristics. 

The extant Puranas contain far more subjects than the five. Some Purāṇas barely touch these five and deal at great length with altogether different topics. Only a few of the extant Purāpas can be said to deal with all the five topics at some length. The five characteristic topics occupy less than three percent of the extent of the extant Mahāpurāṇas. Of all Purāṇas the extant Viṣṇu alone closely agrees with the definition of Purāṇa as 'pañoalaksaṇa,' though it also contains & good many other topics. On a modest calculation the four subjects of vrata, śrāddha, tirtha and dāpa cover at least one hundred thousand slokas in the extant eighteen main Puranas. Several of them have identical chapters on several topics (e. g. Matsya 572 and Padmaa, Vāyu and Brahminda contain long passages that agree verbatim with one another in many matters and details). It is probable, therefore, that the extant principal Purāṇas are partial and gradually inflated representatives of an earlier group of Puranas (not necessarily 18 in number) that

existed before Yājñavalkya. In the present state of our know ledge it is almost an insoluble problem to find out what these Purāṇas were or contained. The number 18 was probably due to the fact that the number is prominent in several connections as regards the Mahābhārata. The Bharata war was fought for 18 days, the total of the vast armies engaged in the conflict came to 18 akṣauhiṇss, the epic has 18 purvans, the Gita also has 18 chapters.1373 

The Purāṇas may be classified into several categories, viz. (1) encyclopaedic like the Agni, Garuḍa and Nāradiya, (2) those mainly dealing with tirthas such as Padma, Skanda and Bhaviṣya, (3) sectarian, such as Linga, Vāmana, Mārkandeya, (4) Historical such as Vāyu and Brabmanda. The Vayu, Brahmānda, Matsya and Viṣṇu are probably the oldest among extant Purāpas, though they too have received substantial additions from time to time. 

There are seven Purāṇas that contain historical material, viz, the ancient dynasties down to the time of the Bhārata war and from the Bharata war to the downfall of the Andhras and the rise of the Guptas, 1974 viz. Vāyu 99. 250-435, Viṣṇu IV. 20. 12 to IV. 24. 44, Brahmānda III, 74, 104-248, Bhagavata IX. 12. 9-16, IX. 22. 34-49 and XII. 17, Garuḍa 140 and 141. 1-12, Bhaviṣya III. 3 and 4 (this account is practically worthless). Matsya contains the fullest list of Āndhra kings and states (273. 16-17) that 29 Andhra kings will rule for 460 years, while the Vayu (99. 357-358) states that 30 Andhra kings will rulo 13746 for 456 ( 406?) yearg. Both Vayu (99. 355 ) and -Matsya (373. 16) ('Pulovā' in Vāyu) make Puloma as the last king of the Āndhras. Ptolemy who published his 'Geography of India' about

Date of Purāṇa references to Andhras 

150 A.D. states that Ptolemaios was king of Baithana (Paithapa) in his days (vide J.I.H. VOL 22,1943, at p. 84 in an article on 'Apostles of Kalyan'. So that these bistorical references to Andhras must be a good deal later than 150 A.D. Only four Puranas vim. Vāyu, Brahmānda, Bhāgavata and Viṣṇu mention in a general way that kings of the Gupta dynasty will rule along the Ganges up to Prayāga, Sākota ( Ayodhyā) and Magadha, but no games of Gupta kings are specified. The passages referring to the Guptas are rather corrupt.1374 It is argued by Pargiter ( in 'Dynastieg of the Kali age' p. XII.) and others that Samudragupta was a great conqueror as his Allahabad Praśasti show! (Fleet's 'Gupta Inscriptions' No. 1). Most scholars are agreed that the Gupta dynasty began to rule about 320 4. D. It is argued that, if the reviser or revisers of the Purāpas had knowo the brilliant campaigns of Samudragupta they would have named him at least and that therefore the revision of the Vayu took place between 320-335 A. D.

Some remarks on the important conclusions of Pargitor and Kirfel are necessary, Pargiter tries to construct history from the earliest times to the Bhārata war which he holds to have taken place about 950 B. O. (AIHT, chap. 15 p. 182). He holds that there were two traditions in ancient India, viz. the Ksatriya tradition and the Brāhmaṇa tradition (AIHT, chap. 5 pp. 58-77). He harps dozens of times on the utter lack of the historio sense among the brāhmaṇas in his work (AIHT), holds that the Purāṇas represent the ksatriya tradition, that there were three racial stocks, viz. the Mānavas (or Māovas as he styles them), the Ailas and the Saudyumnas, that respectively represent the Dravidian, the Aryan and Munda (AIHT chap, 25 pp. 289–302), that the Puranas are Sanskritizations of works in Prakrit (pp. X-XI ) of 'Dynasties of the Kali age'. His date for the Mahābhārata war has not been accepted by later scholars, since his handling of that subject is not judioial, objective or straightforward, but relies too much on his own prejudices and on averages. In his 'Purana texts of the dynasties of the Kali age (pp. 58, 74) he appears to favour the view that the Bhārata war was fought 1050 years before the Nandas i. e, about 1475 B.C. The mss. and the printed Parānas give four different periods between the birth of Pariksit 1376 and

the crowning of Nanda, viz, 1015 years (Viṣṇu), 1050 years (Vāyu, Brahmānda and mss. of Matsya), 1115 years ( Bhagavata ), 1500 years (some mss. of Viṣṇu and of Matsya). Pargiter himself argues forcefully for the trustworthiness of tradition and Paurānika genealogies in R.G. Bhandarkar Presentation volume pp. 107–113 and in AIHT chap. X. p. 119–125. Besides, there is the com mon experience that the total number of years between one well known event and another can be easily remembered and handed down even orally for hundreds of years, while handing down hundreds of royal names is a difficult matter and some names may easily drop out. Moreover, the Matsya, Brahmāpda and Vāyu themselves say that they 1377 mention only the prominent kings of the Ikṣvāku line and the Bșhadratha line 1378 and even as to the Paurava 1379 line it is clear that that dynasty had many names not all of which are enumerated. There is therefore every possibility that some kings dropped out even in later genealogies also (as for example Matsya 213. 16, saying that Andhras were 29 and Vāgu 99.357 saying they were 30 ). Merely counting the total of the kings actually named in the Purāṇas would not convoy a quite accurate idea of the total length of years during which that dynasty ruled. Bearing in mind the two matters (viz, trustworthiness of tradition and Paurānika genealogies and the ease of remembering the time distance between too well-known events) he ehould have endeavoured to find out the age of the Bharata War. He brushes aside the statement of the period between Parikṣit and Nanda 28 unreli 

(Continued from last page) states that in the 9th Skandha the Bhagavata assigas 1000 years to 20 kings from Mārjāri of the Māgad ba lide (a contemporary of Pariksit), then 5 Pradyotapa kings ruled for 138 years, then the siśunāgas ruled for 360 years; thus 1498 years passed between Parikṣit and the crowning of Nanda and therefore he supports the readiog of the interval as 1500 years.

able simply on the ground (which appears to me flimsy ) that the figures (1015, 1050) are discrepant (A. LH. T. p. 180). In almost all passages of the Purāṇas there is some discrepancy or other. Therefore, he should have made an endeavour to find out which one of the three perioda (1015, 1050, 1500 ) is supported by the best and oldest mss, and should have stuck to them, part cularly when the Sanskrit equivalents of the three periods (pañcadaśa, pancūśat and pañcasata) are so much alike that scribes might easily have been confused and made their own readings. Even taking the least period of (1015) years, the Mahābhārata War would have to be placed at about 1440 B. C. (adding 1015 to the date of Nanda's enthronement, vize about 425 B. C.). Most Western writers and Prof. S. N. Pradhan (in 'Chronology of ancient India', Caloutta 1927, pp. 2497) find fault with Paurāṇika statements and brush them aside as practically worthless. Prof. Pradhan takes the kings actually named in the three lines, holds that 28 years are the average reign period of each and multiplying the number of kings by 28 arrives at the conclusion that the Mahābhārata war was fought about 1150 B.O. It is not possible to deal at length with his arguments. But he ignores the express words of the Purāṇas that they em merate only the principal or important kings. Besides, there are scholars like Pargiter who regard 17 or 18 years as the average reign of a king in other countries (and in India also). The author cannot accept Prof. Pradhan's reasoning. Most Western writers are loth to assign old dates to matters Indian. Pargiter is no exception. Instead of straightforwardly accepting one of the three periods that was strongly supported by mss, he in dulges in some devices that appear like trioks of jugglery (A. I. H. T. pp. 180-183). His method requires some explanation and examination. 

Vyāsa is said to have been alive when the Bhārata battle was fought at the end of the Dvāpara age and he is also hold to be the author of the 18 Purāpas. The kings before the Bhārata war, the Pandava heroes and a fow descendants of them and of some contemporaries of them are treated by the Matsya, Vāyu, Brahmānda and others as past (atila).

(excluding Arjuna) is said to have been alive when the Purāṇas were narrated to the sages at the sattra. Both Vāyu (99. 282) and Matsya (271.5) state that in the Ikṣvāku line king Divakara, 6th (or 5th in Matsya) in descent from Brhadbala, was alive at the time when the Purāṇas were narrated. Then the same Purāṇas (Vāyu 99.30, Matsya 271. 23 and Brahmānda III. 74. 113) state that in the line of Jarāgandha (ruler of Magadha ), who was a contemporary of the Pāṇdavas and whose son Sahadeva was killed in the Bhārata war, there was Senājit who was a contemporary of Adhisima-krspa and Divākara and who was 7th in descent from Sahadeva. These three are desoribed as vartamāna kings in the Purāpas and all those that came after these three are described ag bhavisya. Pargiter first (AIHT p. 180) takes the total of the kings of the three dynasties, Aikṣvāka, Paurava and Māgadha that are actually named (ignoring what the Purāṇas say viz. that only the principal or important kings are named and not all) and the total of the re igns of all these (1408 years), finds that the average of the reign of each king in the three lines works out at such large figures as 47, 50, 31, which he regards as impossible when tested by real historical averages. But he forgets that the Purāṇas say that in the Aikṣvāka, Magadha and Peurava lines and also generally only the prominent kings are mentioned and also that the extant Purāṇas are only fragments left of the originals, since in the Brahmānda (III. 74) all Paurava and Aikṣvāka kings are altogether lost. Then he takes the total number of kings in ten kingdoms up to Mahāpadma and arrives at the average of 26 kings for each kingdom (AIHT p. 181). Then he says that the average of fourteen series of kings in Eastern and Western countries which he examined comes to 19 years for each reign and, holding that the average in eastern countries is less than in western countries, he arrives at the average of 18 years for each reign (pp. 181–182), which he regards as fair and rather liberal. He then multiplies the average 18 (of length of reigns ) by 26 (the average number of kings in ten countries which he supposes to be the only kings in those ten) and arrives at the figure 468 years. He adds these to the date whioh be assigns to Mahāpadma Nanda 38% B. C. and thus arrives at 850 B. O. as the mean date of the beginning of the reign of Adhisimakrsna, Divakara and Sepājīt, who were vartamāna kings. Then he takes five as the average of the kings between the vartamāna kings and Yudhiṣthira and assigning about 100 years to those 5 kings, arrives at the date 950 B, O, for the Bbārata war. HoFargiter and the Bhārata war 

849 

disoards (AIHT p. 180 n 3) the astronomical evidence contained in the Purāṇas (and the Mahābhārata) about Bharata war in a single sentence viz, that astronomical statements can have no scientific precision and can only have been formed by estimate at the close. The probable date of the Mahābhārata war has been discussed by the author at some length on materials supplied by the Mahābbārata, the Purāṇas, Varāhamihira, Āryabbata and Inscriptions in vol. II, pp. 895-923 and there fore he does not go into that question here. But he strongly disapproves of the methods of Pargiter and the date he deduces. Later scholars like Kirfel have not accepted the conclusions of Pargiter about two separate traditions and about the Purāṇas being Sanskritizations of originals written in Prakrit and Kharoṣthi script (p. XVI. of Intro. to 'Purāṇa Texta &c.). The importance of another independent source has not been taken proper notice of by Pargiter and even by Kirfel. It appears that about 300 B.C. Megasthenes was supplied with a list of kings from Bacchus to Alexander's tima (153 or 154 in gumber) covering by their reigns a period of 6451 years and three months. Vide 'Ancient India as described by Megasthenes and Arrian' by McCrindle (1877) p. 115 and Cambridge History of Ancient India, Vol. I (1922, p. 409). Even supposing for argument that the account of kings is not trustworthy the fact remains that about 300 B. C. Indians claimed that they had lists of kings that reigned before that date for thousands of years (and not for a few hundred years as Pargiter would have us believe ). 

It has been shown above that Apastamba mentions a Bhavi syatpurāṇa and quotes four verses from a Purana (p. 817, note 1328). That Bhaviṣyat-purana was probably so called because it contained in a prophetic voin the names and other details of kings that flourished after the Bhārata heroes and after a fow generations of descendants of them and their contemporaries and probably purported to have been composed by some sage or by Vyāba. As the Kali age is said to have started after the Bhārata war, as Parāśara, his son Vyāsa and Vyāsa's son Suka were regarded as more or less contemporaries of the Pāpdayas that lived in the Dvāpara age and as all the 18 Purāpas are deemed to have been composed by Vyāsa 1381 in the Dvāpara age, the history of the kings of the Kali age from the descendants

of Adhisimakrsna and his contemporarios downwards hās. been furnished by the Purāṇas in the form of a prophetic style. It has not been clearly noticed by both Pargiter and Kirfel that the so-called future kings are divided into two groups, viz. the kings of the Aila, Aikṣvāka and Magadha lines from Adhisimakrsna, Divakara and Senājit to the last scions of these lines ( such 1382 as Sumitra in the Aikṣvāka line, Ksemaka in the Aila line) form one group and later kings in the lines of Pradyotas, Sungas, Andhras, Sakas and others form another group and further that the first group was most probably dealt with in the ancient Bhaviṣya-purāṇa or some other Purāpa if we rely on Āpastamba, but the other group not having been in existence when the Bhaviṣyat was composed (before 500-400 B.C.) was dealt with by the extant Puranas from information received by them apart from the ancient Bhaviṣyat, This is clear from the passages of the Matsya and Vāyu quoted 1383 below. The Matsya says 'After this I shall proclaim thoge future kings in the Aida (Aila), Aikṣvāka and Paurava lines and those with whom those three benign (or virtuous) families will come to an end and I shall enumerate all of these kings that are narrated in the Bhaviṣya.

Ksatriya class), Parasayas (the Parsi tribe or parsons born of a śūdra father and brāhmaṇa mother?), Sūdras (as kings) and others that are foreigners, the Andhrae, Sakas, Pulindas, Calikas, Yavadas, fishermen, Abhiras and Sabaras and others born of Mleccba (tribes these kings I shall proclaim one after another in order and by name. Out of these (two groups) the first is Adhisimakrṣpa who is now alive and I shall speak of the kings of his line that are narrated in the Bhaviṣya'. This passage makes it perfectly clear that in the ancient Bhaviṣyat kings of the three lines of Aila, Aikṣvāka and Paurava to the last of them were enumerated (vide note 1382), but that the later kings like the Andbrag and Sakas were not enumerated therein. I agree with Pargiter (p. VIII. in Intro. to 'Purāpa Toxta' &c.) that the words 'Bhavisye kathitān' in Matsya (50.77) or 'Bhavisye pathitān' in Vāyu (in 99.292) rṛfer to the descendants mentioned in the Bhaviṣya and that they do not simply mean 'mentioned in future." I fail to understand, however, why be regards 'Bhaviṣyat' as a perversion of 'Bhaviṣya'. Bhaviṣyat is as good a word as Bhaviṣya, being employed in several passages such as Varāba ( 177, 34 ), Matsya ( 53. 62). 

Pargiter probably wants to identify the Bhaviṣyat of Apa stamba with the Bhaviṣya of later times. There is no evidence except the name to identify the two. It, therefore, appears that the extant Purāṇas base their narrative as to the three lines of Aila, Aikṣvāka and Paurava kings on the materials contained in the ancient Bhaviṣya and as to other lines and compara tively later kings they relied on other materials or oral traditions that they could collect. This inference receives support from other circumstances. The extant Purāṇas quote versos called Anuyamsa slokas or gathas about ancient kings, such as Kārta virya (in Vāyu 94. 20, Matsya 43, 24, Brahmānda III. 68-20, Brahma 13.17) and also about the last scions of the Alla and Aiksvāka lines, viz. Sumitra and Ksemaka. But so far as kings of comparatively later dynasties such as those of the Andbras, Sungas and others are concerned, no such gāthās or slokas are quoted in the Purāṇas. There is absolutely no evidence to hold, as Pargiter doas (p. XIII of Purāṇa Texts' &o.), that the ancient Bhaviṣya contained & reference to the Guptas. The ancient Bhaviṣya was composed before Āpastamba (ie, before the 4th or 5th B.O.) and hence originally could have contained no reference to the Guptas (whose rule began about 320 A. D.). The Matsya does not refer to the Guptas and mentions only the 

852 

History of Dharmajāstra (Soc. IV, Oh XXII 

downfall of the Andhras. Therefore, the Matsya should be regard ed as composed or revised about the middle (or end) of the Srd century A. D., though the possibilities of some chapters or versos being added after that date cannot be ruled out. When the Vayu (99. 383), Brahmānda (III. 74. 195), Viṣṇu (IV. 24. 18) and Bhagavata (XII. 1. 37) mentioned the Guptas as rulers the first two probably added these passages just about the time when Gupta rule began and the Viṣṇu and Bhāgavata (which present a corrupt text) might bave borrowed the information from mss. of Vāyu or Brahmānda. It is clear, however, that the first two (out of the four) Purāṇas were composed or revised about 320-335 A. D. and the other two later still. 

Kirfel's work ‘Purāṇa Pancalaksana' is one of fundamental importance so far as the Purāṇas are concerned, since it adopts & new method for the treatment of Paurāṇika material. The German Introduction of this work has been reproduced in English in the Journal of the Shri Venkatesa Institute at Tirupati, in yol. VII, pp. 81–121 and vol VIII. pp. 9-33. Kirfel disagrees with many of the views of Pargiter. His main con clusions are: Apart from the abridgemont in Agni and Garuḍa as well as the prose paraphrase in Viṣṇu, there are only three completo groups of Purāpa texts viz. Brahma and Harivamsa, Brahmaṇda and Vāyu, and that of Matsya, all other Purāṇas containing only smaller or larger parts of the same. Of the three groups, Brahmānda and Hariyamsa are the oldest ( and not Brah māpda and Vayu as Pargiter in A.I.H.T. p. 78 says). Kirfel holds that the Brahmānda and Vayu must have originally been a single Purāṇa, particularly because the largest parts of both agree with each other, that Pargiter is not right in thinking that the additions in Vāyu and Brahmānda were borrowed from the ancient Bhaviṣya (Kirfel p. 18, vol. VII. of J. V. O. I. p. 92), but that the borrowed material goes back to an independent text. Kirfel does not accept Pargiter's theory that the Purāṇas were Sanskritizations of Prakrit texts, that the Viṣṇu in its existing form is a younger Purāṇa than the Vāyu or Brabrānda in spite of the fact that it most faithfully observes the basic arrangement of the five characteristics of Purāṇas. The division of Purāṇas into 18 and the distribution of Purāṇas into sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa are not original items but are applicable only to the last definitive texts of the Purāṇas. Pargiter thought that there existed an Ur-Purāpa which had treated of the five topios (of sarga &c.) in ideal completeness and clear disposition Kirfel 

Kirfel and Pargiter 

859 

says that this is soarooly more than an arbitrary assumption (p. XL VIII of Kirfel's Intro. and J. V.O. I. vol. VIII, p. 31). 

The present author may tentatively accept most of the con clusions of Kirfel, but he differs, as stated above from Kirfel's view that the five characteristic topics ( sarga &c.) are the oldest constituent parts of the whole Purāṇa Literature. 

A lengthy discussion of the age of the Purāpas is not very relevant to the subject of this section. But it would not be entirely out of place if the author said a few words thereon. 

The author's position about the Purāṇas is as follows: We know hardly anything about the Purāṇa mentioned in Atharva veda, the Satapatha and the ancient Upaniṣads; but this much is clear that Purana had attained a status of sacredness like the Vedas and was closely associated with Itihāsa even in Vedic times. This is the first stage in the evolution of Purāṇa Literg ture, but we know nothing about the contents of the Purāṇa in those ancient times. The Tai. Ā, mentions Purānāni, therefore in its time there must have been three Purāṇas at least. As Āp. Dh. 8. quotes four verses from a Purāṇa and expressly names Bhaviṣyatpurāṇa, it follows that by the 5th or 4th century B. C. at the latest, there was in existence a Bhaviṣyat-purana and other Purāṇas or a Purāṇa, that contained sarga and pratisarga and some Smrti material. This we may regard as the 2nd definite stage of Purana Literature, of the contents of which we have some traces at least. 

The Mahābhārata quotes hundreds of versos (called slokas, gathas, anuvainsa ślokas), some of which have a bearing upon Paurāṇika subjects and have a Paurāṇika ring. Some examples may be cited. The Vanaparva 1384 quotes two verses about the spiritual prowess of Viśvāmitra and about his assertion that he was a brāhmaṇa. The Anuśāsanaparva 138 quotes certain

gātbūs said to have been sung by the pit[8 about the importance of a son or sons, which agree in letter and spirit with Verses on the same subject in the Puranas. In the Udyoga-parva 1386 Bhisma is said to have addressed a verse to Paraśurāma that was sung by Marutta and declared in a Purāṇa. In the Purāṇas also there are frequent quotations of ślokas,1387 gāthās and anuvamśaślokas sung by people described as Paurānika (in Vayu 70, 76, 88. 114-116, 88. 168-169, Brahmāṇda III. 63. 69-70) or as purūvdah or purāṇajñāḥ in Vāyu, 83. 171 and 95. 19, Brahmāṇda III. 63. 171). Vāyu (93. 94-101) mentions several gāthās as sung by Yayāti, most of which occur in the Adiparva 75. 50-53 and 85. 12–15, Brahmānda III. 68.96--103 and in other purāṇas also. It is quite possible that these gāthās and slokas said to have been declared by those who knew Purāṇas were taken from the Purāṇa or Purāṇas known to Āpastamba. As Yaj. I, 3 regards Purāṇa as one of the sources of dharma, it follows that some Purāpas containing smsti material must have been composed a good deal before that smṛti i. e. before the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. at the latest. This is the third stage in the evolution of Purāṇas. It is difficult to say when the extant Matsya was originally composed but it was revised about the middle (or close ) of the 3rd century A D., since it speaks of the downfall of the Andhra dynasty, but does not refer to the Guptas. But it is possible that the original kernel of the Matsya may be earlier than this by a few centuries. The same applies to Vāyu and Brabmānda. The Vayu and Brahmāṇda also were compiled or added to about 320-335 A. D., since they refer to the Guptas but do not name any Gupta king. These two in their present form may also be referred to this third stage. Most of the Maha purāṇas were composed or completed in the period from the 5th

or 6th century A. D. to the 9th century A. D. This represents the 4th stage in the evolution of Purāṇa literature. The Upe purāṇas began to be compiled from about the 7th or 8th century A. D. and their numbers went on increasing till about the 13th century A. D. or even later. This is the last phase. Thus there is enough evidence to hold that the Purāṇas began to influence Hindu society a few centuries before Christ, that their influence continued in full force till the 17th or 18th century A. D. and that it continues to some extent oven now. After the 9th century no further Mahāpurāṇas appear, but additional matter appears to have been unscrupulously inserted in several Purāṇas, the worst example of the kind being the third part of the Bhaviṣya, which contains stories of Adam and Eve, of Pithviraj and Jaicandra, Taimur, Akbar, Caitanya, Bhattoji, Nadirshah and so on. 

The word 'purāpa' occurs over a dozen times in the Rgveda, is an adjective and means 'ancient, old'. The Nigbantu (III. 27) mentions six Vedic words as having the sense of 'purāpa' viz. pratnam, pradivaḥ, pravayāḥ, sanemi, pūrvyan, ahnāya. Yaska (Nirukta III, 19) derives the word 'purana' as 'purā navam bbavati' (what was now in former times ). The Rgveda does not contain the word 'purātana' (ancient). Purāṇa may be a very old form of purātana' through the intermediate form 'purāapa.' From meaning ancient the word 'purāṇa'came to mean a work dealing with ancient tales; it became a noun and was applied in the times of the Atharvaveda, the Satapatha and the Upaniṣads to a class of works containing ancient tales. When purāṇa came to mean a work dealing with ancient tales, to speak of a Bhaviṣyat-purāṇa was apparently a contradiction in terms. That contradiction was probably not minded or was ignored by the thought that works that narrated old tales gradually came to inolude comparatively rocont ones and bad therefore to adopt & prophetic style of composition with reference to the latter. 

The Vāyu 1388 derives the word 'Purāṇa' from 'purā' (in ancient times, formerly) and the root 'an' (to breathe or live), and therefore according to it the word literally means that which lives in the past' or that which breathes ancient times',

Hislory of Dharmadastra [ Soc. IV, Oh XXI 

The Padmapurāṇa propounds & slightly different etymology, viz." it is called Purāṇa because it desires or likes the past" from 'purā' and the root vas' ( to desire or to like). 

The question why the extant Purāṇas do not narrate the traditions about the dynasties of the Guptas and their successors cannot be satisfactorily answered. One reason may be that the original kernel of some Purāṇas like the extant Matsya were compiled before the Guptas rose to power, while others like the Vāyu and Brahmānda were compiled while the Gupta rule was in its infancy. Another reason may have been that in the 5th and following centuries when many of the extant Purāṇas were compiled northern India was very much disturbed by the invasions of foreigners like the Hūnas, 1389 Toramāna and Mihirakula, numerous sects and schisms had arisen, Buddhism had become powerful and therefore the first task of the intelligent and devout followers of the Vada was held to be to wean the common people away from schisms like that of Buddha, to lay down the foundations of a new ideology among the masses and to emphasize and assimilate as many of the doctrines of the sects and schisms as possible with their ancient traditions and practices. The intelligent classes, therefore, emphasized the importance of such virtues as ahimsā, satya, bhakti and of vratas, pilgrimages, śrāddhas and dānas and were probably not in a mood to record the names of foreign conquerors or of small chieftains fighting with each other and unable to repel the cruel invaders. For the absence of references to the dynasties of the Guptas and their successors, Pargiter blames the brāhmaṇas in the following characteristic passage (AIHT chap. 4 p. 57) 'the absolute dearth of traditional history after that stage is quite intelligible, both because the compilation of the Purana had set a goal of tradition and because the Purana soon passed into the hands of brāhmanas who preserved what they had received, but with the brahmanio lack of the historio sense, added nothing about the later kings'. Supposing for argument that brāhmaṇas lacked the historic sense, Pargitor's opinion appears to be entirely one-sided. He assigns no reason why the gūtas, whose business was to record and preserve historic tradition ( as he himself says on p. 58 of AIHT), did not stick to their business and did not continue to compose gonealogios of

later kings and to add further items of history to already existing recorded tradition, nor does he explain how the sūtas could be ousted or allowed themselves to be ousted from their age-old avocation by the brāhmaṇas. It is probable that foreign dynas ties like that of Kaniṣka and the Hūṇas did not encourage the gūtas who had sunk low in the social scale and the sūtas probably became Buddhists, &e Buddhism with its Jātaka stories gave to all persons following a bardic profession sufficient scopo for earning their livelihood. 

The legends about Vyāsa and Sūta may be briefly considered. The Purāṇas declare that Vyāsa was the son of Parāśara, was also called Kșspa Dvaipāyana and was an incarnation of Viṣṇu ( of Brahmā also in Vayu 77. 74–75 and of Śiva in the Kurma II. 11. 136). He was called Draipāyana 1390 because he was born on an island (dvipa) in the Yamunā river and Krsna be cause he was of dark complexion. His mother was Satyavati and son was Suka. He was called Vyāsa because he is supposed to have divided or arranged the one Veda into four parts (from the root 'as' 4th conjugation to throw' with the upagarga 'vi'). He instructed four disciples in the four Vedas, viz. Paila, Vaiśampāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu respectively in Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharyaveda. His 5th disciple was Sūta Romaharṣaṇa to whom was imparted Itihasa-Purāṇa. The son of Būta was Sauti who narrated the Mahābhārata to Śaunaka and other gages in the Naimiṇa forest. It was believed that whenever dharma and Veda declined Vyāsas were born for the benefit of men (Brahma 158. 34). The Kūrma (I. 52. 1-9 ) sets out 27 names of different Vyāsas, while Vāyu (23. 115-219), Brahmānda (IL. 35. 116-125 ), Viṣṇu 1391 (III. 3. 11-19)

enumerate the names of the 28 Vyasas of the 28 Dvāpara ages of the Vaivasvata Manvantara (which is the ourront one). How Vyāsa put together the Purapas is described in several Puranas * He who was an adept in the meaning of Purāpa composed & Purāpa-samhita from ( the material supplied by ) tales, episodes, gāthās ( stanzas) and correct ascertainment or descriptions of Kalpas '. 1392 This shows that, while the Vedic texts were pres. erved with unparalleled care by the brāhamaṇas, the very ancient Itihāga-purāṇa, though called the 5th Veda, was not kept intact with care similar to that bestowed on the four Vedas and that this fifth Voda was allowed to be inflated by fresh addi tions from time to time, 

In connection with Vyāsa's legendary role as an arranger of the Veda, Pargiter has a theory of his own which must be briefly noticed and examined. He develops that theory on pp. 9-10 of A. I, H. T. Ho refers to the Rgveda as the greatest brahmanical book, says that it is a compilation of hymns com posed by many authors and is arranged according to certain principles. His words are * It (Rgveda ) niust manifestly have been compiled and arranged by some one or more persons, yot Vedic Literature says absolutely nothing about this. The brāhmaṇas cannot have been ignorant about it, for they pros erved it and its text with unparalleled care. **Vedic Literature professes to know and declares the names of the authors of near ly all the hymns and even of single verses, yet it ignores all knowledge of the person or persons who afterwards compiled and arranged these hymns. To suppose that when it preserved the earlier information it was ignorant of the later work in so vital a matter is ridiculous.' From this silence in the Vedic Litera ture about the persons that compiled and arranged the Rgveda, Pargiter at once jumps to the positive and emphatio conclusion, as is usual with many western writers on Sanskrit Literature and Indology to argue from silence, that Vedic Literature has deliberately suppressed all information on these matters' (AIHT p. 9). He refers to the fact that the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas are full of Vyāsa and repeatedly declare that the Veda was arranged by Vyasa and points out that Vedic Literature is

remarkably ratioent about Vyasa Pārāsarya (who is mentioned as & pupil of Viṣvaksena in the Vamga list at the end of the Sāmavidhana Brahmaṇa and in the Taittiriya Aranyaka) and then he reiterates his charge of the conspirary of silence about Vyāsa ( AIHT. p. 10). Pargiter is ready with a reason for the supposed conspiracy of silence viz. the brāhmaṇas put forward the doctrine that the Veda existed from everlasting; hence to admit that any one had compiled or even arranged it struck at the root of their doctrine and was in common parlance to give their whole 0880 away' (ibid. p. 10). 

Several objections can be raised against the positive asser tion of deliberate and fraudulent suppression inferred from more silence. In the first place, Pargitor is very loose in his statement of facts. Pargiter totally ignores that even in the Rgveda itself, Țk verses, yajus texts and sāman chants are differentiated. To give only a few references, vide for Rka (Rg. II. 35. 12, V. 6.5, V. 27. 4, V. 44. 14-15), in both verses of the last rk and smans being separately mentioned; for yajus vide Rg. V.62.5, X. 181.3); for saman chants vide Rg. II, 43.2 (udgāteva sakune sāna gāyasi), VII, 81, 5 ( Śravat sāma giyamānam), VII. 95. 7 (suddhena sāmnā). 

The epic and purānic texts indicate that Voda was thought to be originally one, but was arranged into four groups, that the four groups of texts were entrusted for preservation and propagation to four different disciples of Vyāsa. The Rgveda has two arrangements, one into mandalas and sūktas and the other into aṣtakas, adhyāyas and vargas. The Taittirlyasamhita and Atharvaveda are arranged into kāṇdas. Not a word is said in any of these accounts to which Pargiter refers about pioking up hymns already existing or their being arranged in mandalas ar adhyāyas or kāṇdas by Vyasa. Further, the reason assigned for the supposed deliberato suppression of the name of the arranger of the Veda is quite flimsy, not to say ridiculous. Every hymn of the Rgveda or every mantra has & qṣi who by the ancient Indian tradition was not the author (as Pargiter puts it) but only the seer. It is clear from Brāhmaṇa texts, Upaniṣads and smrtis that from very 1393 anoient times it was a very strict principle

that no one should teach or repeat in japa or employ & mantra in a sacrifice without knowing the rṣi, the metre, the deity and the Use (viniyoga) of it and dire consequences were declared to follow for him who was remiss in these matters. Hymns and mantras were arranged in different groups for different religi ous rites and solemn sacrifices or for other purposes (such as śāntis). It is not necessary to remember who arranged the required mantras for rites, sacrifices and other purposes. The Brāhmaṇa texts and srauta sūtras prescribe the manner of the employment of the same mantras for various purposes and the Anukramaṇis contain the names of the seors, metres and the deities of hymns and individual mantras also. As every mantra of the Veda was supposed to be only seen by a sage and as eternal, the more compilation of them in one or more series of the more arrangement of mantras or hymns in different groups for different purposes did not at all affect or interfere with the eternality of mantras or hymns. Pargiter's 80-called reason for suppressing the name of the arranger of the Veda is simply do reason at all. 

Pargiter did not stop to consider possible explanations. One of the most plausible is now put forth. The Mahābhārata and the Purapas (a very extensive literature) were attributed to Vyāsa, who, as shown above in n. 1390, had come to be looked upon as Viapu or as an avatāra of Vispu. The four Vedas and the Beveral different śākhās (recensions) of each Veda were well known, By a sort of post facto explanation, the distribution of the Veda into four main groups was claimed to have been brought about by the divinely inspired Vyāsa, whose Puranas are, as will be apparent from note 1349 above and as will be shown in more detail later, glorified as even anterior and superior to the Veda. The eternality of the Veda had to be maintained and at the same time Vyāsa was to be glorified.

How Vyasa was proclaimed as Veda-arranger 

861 

The easiest way was to proclaim that Vyāsa, the author of the great Epio and of the distribution of Purāṇas into eighteen, was also responsible for the division or arrangement of the Veda. If all this glorification of Vyāga occurred in the centuries immediately preceding and following Christ, how could the supposed arranger of the Veda be mentioned in the early Vedic Literature, which, most scholars agree, was closed some centuries before Buddha (i.e. before the 6th century B. C.)? No body claims that the arrangement into mandalas or astakas or kāṇdas is eternal. It is only the hymns or mantras that are claimed to be eternal. Even the padapātha of the Rgveda is declared to be non-etornal and is ascribed to Sākalya whom tbe Nirakta criticises in VI, 28. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. III. 242 expressly states that the pada and krama arrangements of the Veda are due to human authors.1394 This theory explains all matters and has far better claims to be accepted than Pargiter's bold ascription of fraudulent suppression inferred from (& suppogod) silence. 

The Purāṇas do not speak with one voice about their own origin and transmission. After declaring that Vyāsa entrusted the preservation and propagation of the Puranas to Sūta, the Vāyu and other Purāṇas contain a somewhat different version. The Vāyu narrates (61. 55-61): Sūta had six disciples, vis, Suniti Atreya, Akstavraṇa Kāśyapa, Agnivarcas Bhārdvaja, Mitrayu Vasiṣtha, Sāvarṇi Saumadatti, Suśarman Sāmśapāyana. Three of these, viz. Kāśyapa, Sāvarpi and Sāmsapāyana prepared new Purana-aambitās and Sūta's own was the 4th and the original one. All were divided into four kāndas, contained the name sense (matter), but differed in their readings as the sūkhas of the Veda differ. All had four thousand verses except tho namhita of Samsapāyana. These four are said to be the basic saribitās (in Brahmāṇda II. 35. 66 ) or original samhitas (in Vāyu 61, 58 pūrvasambitās). The Brahmānda (II. 35. 63–70) has the same account in almost in the same words. Viṣṇu (IL. 6. 16-17), Agni 271 (11-12) are briefer but agree in the main with Vayu. The Bhagavāta (XII. 7.467) differs from all these to some extent. That there is some substance in this story appears from stray passages in several chapters of the Vayu (56.1, 60. 33-34, 62. 1, 89. 16) and the Brahmapda (IL. 34, 34,

II. 36. 1 &o.), where samsampāyana is the inquirer and Sāta replies. 

The personality of Sūta is somewhat of an enigma in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas, Sūta is called Romaharṣaṇa 1395 or Lomaharṣap& because he made the hair (roman or loman) of his audience bristle or stand erect by his touching and eloquent speech. In the Skanda it is stated that he was so called because his own hair stood on end when he was being instructed by Draipāyana. One meaning of the word sūta is chrioteer' and another meaning is 'a person of a mixed prafiloma caste born of the union of a brāhmaṇa woman with a kṣatriya male' and the cognate word 'Magadha' means 'one who is born of a pratiloma union between a vaiśya male and a ksatriya female' (vide Manu X. 71. Yāj. I. 93-94). The Arthaśāstra of Kautilya says 13% the same thing about sūta and māgadha, but adds that *the gūta and migadha mentioned in the Puranas are diffe rent from these, because he (the sūta) is distinguished from (ordinary) brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas'. Kautilya means that in his days sūta and māgadba were pratiloma castes, but the sūta and magadha mentioned as the first reciters of the Purāṇas are a category apart, that they do not belong to the pratiloma castes and are both distinguished from brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas (ie, söta of the Purāṇās is treated more or less as a great sage or semi divine person). The Vayu (1. 26–33 and 62–147 ff), Padma (II. 27. 65-87, V. 1. 29-32), Brahmāṇda (II, 36. 158-173), the Skanda (Prabbāsakhapda 1. 8) say 1397 that in the sacrifice of Pitāmaha (i. o. Brahmā) Sūta sprang up as a partial avatara of Viṣṇu on

The origin of sūta and Magadha

the day when soma juice was extracted and māgadha also thus arose. It is further stated in the same Purāpas that the havis (offering) meant for Indra (symbol of the ksatriya class) got mixed with that meant for Bṛhaspati ( symbol of brābmaṇa class and learning) and that the sūta was born just at the time when the mixed-up offering was presented to the gods. From this the gūta ( in later times) had duties similar to those of the original gūta and it was said that the sūta is offspring of the mized union of brāhmaṇa (woman) with ksatriya (male). Then another story is grafted on to this ( in Vāyu 62. 147 ff, Brahmānda II. 36. 170-173 and in others ) that the original 1398 Sūta and Magadha sang the praises of king Pșthu, son of Vona, who being pleased, made a present of the country of Anūpa to Sūta and the country of Magadha to Māgadha and since that time gūtas and māgadhas sing the praises of kings and awaken them in the morning with blessings. The Vāyu itself, 1399 however, gays (1. 33-34 ) that sūta was born at the time of the extracting of soma juice in the sacrifice of Pșthu Vainya 

The authors of the extant Vāyu and other Purāṇas are conscious that the gūta and māgadha in their times had no adhikara for Veda, that the business of the sūta was to note the dynasties of goda, sages and kings that are found in the Itihāga and Purāṇas. They felt scandalized by the fact that great sages like Saunaka were said to have learnt Purāṇas from the sata who in their times belonged to a pratiloma caste, about which Gautama, Viṣpudharmasutra and Kautilya himself lay down that pratilomas are like gūdras, are condemned by aryas and are

beyond the pale of the usual duties of brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas ( such as upanayana, Veda study, teaching &o.). Learning by a brāhmapa from a ksatriya was considered even in Upaniṣad times as contrary to the natural order of things. Vide the words of king Ajātasatru to Gārgya Bālāki 1400 quoted below. Therefore, to account for the position of Sūta as instructor in Itibāsa and Purāṇa of great sages like Saunaka, the story of Sūta's birth was invented and he was placed in a separate category by himself. This must have occurred some centuries before Kautilya who was aware of the low position of sūta and magadha and differentiates the Paurāṇika sūta from the prati loma sūta and māgadha. One need not accept the divine character of Sūta, one has only to understand that in very ancient times brāhmaṇas could, without any qualms and with out loss of prestige, learn about legends from a sūta, but that in the times when the extant purāṇas were compiled the position had entirely changed. 

Next to Pargiter and Kirfel, one must mention the name of Prof. R. C. Hazra who has bestowed much labour and thought on the purāṇas in general and on individual purāṇas. One cannot but feel high admiration for Prof. Hazra's industry, patience and enthusiasm. One regrets, however, to find that ho has developed a tendency to assign rather more ancient dates to the extant Puranas and Upapurāpas than the available evidence would warrant. Besides, he has been so much engrossed in the study of Puranas that he sometimes scents & reference to Purāṇas where none in fact exists. For example, in 'Puranio Tecords on Hindu rites and customs' (p. 6) Prof. Hazra observes that Vijñāneśvara tells us of Hārsta's reference to the opinion of Puranas in prescribing penance in normal circumstances to those who eat the food dedicated to the patriarchs. The words of the Mitā kṣarā 141 of Vijñānesvara are quoted in the note

below and olearly show that there the word 'purāneṣu' means "Sraddhas called purana' and has nothing to do with Purana works. Another defect noticed in Prof. Hazra's writings is that he sees too much meaning in simple words and phrases and is not cautious in his conclusions as a scholar of his standing and experience should be. In a recent paper on the Aśvamedha, the common source of origin of the Purana Pancalaksapa and the Mahābhārata' in ABORI, vol. 36 (1956) pp. 190-203, he cites the Atharvavada verso quoted above (p. 816, n 1325) in which pk and sāma verses are mentioned separately and 'purāṇa' (purā. pam yajuṣa saha) is associated with yajus, and says this collocan tion seemed to him bighly significant and that he felt fully convinced that the Purāṇa pancalaksana and the Mahabharata owe their origin to the Aśvamedha sacrifice and especially to its Pāriplava ākhyānas. Reasons of available space preclude a detailed examination of this paper. But a few fundamental objections and matters must be mentioned. The words 'purāṇam yajuṣā saha' should ordinarily mean (as in passages like Devadattaḥ saputra āgatah) no nore than 'Purāns and Yajus'. Yāj. 1. 101 provides 1 402 that after the daily bath, a vedic householder should undertake every day the jape of portions of the (three) Vedas, the Atharvaveda, Puranas together with Itihasa and of adhyātmiki-vidyā (Upaniṣads). There is no special meaning here in the association 'parāṇāni setihāgāni' beyond 'Purāpas and Itihāsa'. One, therefore, fails to under stand how the words 'purāṇam yajuṣā saha' are highly signi ficant for arriving at the conviction that Aśvamedha is the origin of Purāpa and Mahābhārata. Then on p. 20% of the paper 

(Continued from løst page) Sraddhas are of three kirds, mar (up to ten days after death). Ang or pern ( performed after ten days up to one year ) and getur (those performed after a year from a person's death). The word gerong means yang mag हारीत provides मायश्चित्त for eating the food in the three kinds of माद्धम, नष, far and girl. The word gemony in that verse of grsta bas nothing to do with Parāng works. Vide H, of Dh, vol. IV. p. 262 notes 591a and 593 for more details about the three kinds of Sraddhas.

in question Prof. Hazra quotes & passage from 1403 Saṅkari dārya's bhāsya on Chandogya III. 4. 1-2 and completely misun derstands the great acārya when he observes “Śhaṅkara's use of the word 'rātri' in the plural (id 'rātriṣu') shows that in his opinion the Itihāsa and Purāṇa were employed every night during the Pāriplava and not merely on the sth and oth nights respectively, as the Satapatha Br. and Sāṅkhāyanaśrautasutra say" (Italios author's). The Aśvamedha sacrifice lasted for a year and listening to the Pāriplava went on for a year, each Pāripla va being a cycle of ten days (or rather nights, as the recitation by the hotr priest was to take place after the morning, mid-day and evening istis to Savitr were finished). The texts to be recited and the nature of the legends to be Darrated on each of the cycle of ten days are fixed and Itihāsa and Purāṇa are to be recited only on the 8th and 9th nights. As each cycle was of ten days, there would be 36 cycles of Pāriplava in a year and Itihasa would be recited on 36 nights in the year and Purāṇa also would be recited on 36 nights in the year. It is for this reason that Saṅkarācārya speaks of *Pāriplavāsu rātriṣu' in the plural, but he does not say that Itihāsa and Purāpa were to be recited on all' nights (sarrāsu rātriṣu), while Prof. Hazra represents him as so saying. There is absolutely no warrant in the ancient texts for saying that on each day (or night) of the Pāriplava Itihāsa or Purāṇa was to be recited or that Saṅkarācārya said anything of the kind. The testimony of the Vedāntasūtra 1404 is completely against this view of Prof. Hazra. Vedāntasūtra III. 4. 23 refers to certain stories mentioned in the Upanisads such as 'Yājñavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyāyani' (Br. Up. IV. 5. 1), 'Pratardana, son of Divodāsa, went to Indra's abode' (Kauṣi taki Up. III. 1), "Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa was a pious donor giving much wealth to the people and keeping an open house for distributing food' (Chān. Up. IV.1.1), and remarks that such stories were not to be recited in Pāriplava, since the stories to be recited therein are expressly specified beginning with the story

of king Manu Vaivasvata (which was to be recited on the first night of the Pariplava). 

Prof. Hazra has recently published (in 1958) Studies in the Upapurāṇas' vol. I pp. 1-400 on Saura and Vaiṣṇava Upa purāṇas (in the Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series 1958). This would be briefly dealt with a little later. 

Prof. Ramchandra Dikshitar also has written a good deal on the Purāṇas. His writings are boset by the same infirmity that attaches to Prof. Hazra's work to some extent. For example, in & paper published in the Proceedings of the 13th Indian History Congress (pp. 46-50) on the Viṣṇupurāṇa he first states (p. 46) that he is more concerned with the extant Vispupurāṇa and after pointing out that the topics of vratas, of fasts, of tirtha, are absent from the extant Vispupurāṇa he concludes that the extant Viṣṇupurāṇa can safely be placed in the 6th or 7th century B. C. Hardly any modern and critical scholar would accept such a date for the extant Viṣṇupurāṇa. Instead of relying on the absence of certain topics he should rather have relied on what it actually contains to find out the probable date of the. extant Viṣṇupurāṇa. 

In connection with the Purāṇas the author must refer at some length to the Introductory remarks of Ballalagona, king of Bengal, in his Dānasagara, edited in the B. I series (1953-1956 ) by Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacārya (three parts of text pp. 1-722 and 4th part an Introduction in English with Indices). Those remarks evince a bold critical faculty rare in our medieval Sanskrit writers. He mentions, besides the Gopathabrāhmaṇa, the Rāmāyaṇa, the Mahābhārata, the smrtis and dharmaśāstras of Gautama, Manu, Yājnavalkya, (count ing Saṅkha Likhita ag two ), Dāna-Bṛhaspati and Bṛhaspati (as separate), Vasiṣtha and others (in all 28), the Chandoga-pari śiṣṭa of Kātyāyana, thirteen principal Purāṇas viz. Brāhma, Vārāba, Agneya, Bhaviṣya, Mātsya, Vāmana, Vāyaviya, Mārkandeya, Vaiṣṇava, śaiva, Skānda, Pādma and Kaurma and the Upapurāṇas named in Kūrma and Adi Purāṇas as contain: ing the procedure of various ) dānas, viz. Ādya, Samba, Kālikā, Nānda (v.1 Nandin), Aditya, Narasimha, Viṣṇudharmottara (declared by Mārkandeya) and the sastra called Viṣṇudharina (eight in all). He mentions that he drow upon all these for the produotion of his work on dāpas, 1375 in number ( verses 11-20

Some of these remarks are very important and the original verses are set out in the note below. 1405 He states that he did. not draw upon the Bhāgavata, the Brahmānda and the Nāradiya as dānas are absent therefrom. He did not rely in his work upon the Lingapurāṇa, though it is a large work, because its essence, he decides, is the same as the treatment of Maha. dānas declared in the Matsyapurāṇa; the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa has been assiduously utilised by him only up to the ( vratavidhis of ) 7th tithi, but he discards the procedures of the 8th and 9th tithis (of the Bhaviṣyapurana), since they are overwhelmed (tainted) with (the doctrines of )1406 heretical sects (Tantrikas,

Bauddhas, &0.); both the Viṣpurahasya and Śivarahasya, though well-known among peoplo, have not been accepted in this work, since they are considered to be more compilations; the Bhavisyottara ( Purāṇa ) which is followed in peoples' practices and is not in conflict ( with orthodox views) has been excluded from this work, since no indications ( evidence ) of its autho ritativeness could be found; the following are ignored in the Dānasāgara for reasons stated: three khandas, viz those con cerned with the tales of Pauṇdra, Rovā and Avanti of the Skanda apart from a part of it that is provalent ( among people ), the Tārksy& ( i. e. Garuḍa) purāṇa, another Brahmapurāṇa, another Agneya (i. Q. Agnipurāṇa ), a Viṣṇupurāṭa containing 23000 vorges, another Lingapurāṇa containing six thousand verses; all these have been discarded for various reasons such as the procedure of dikṣā ( initiation of a disciple by 8 guru in & cult like the Tantrika or Pāncarātra or Pāśupata ) or of the establishment of an image, heretical reasoning, testing of jewels, stories of the doings of (persons of) false genealogies, treating of such matters as dictionaries and grammar, containing incohe rent tales and contradictions, because they lead to the misleading of people by the description of or reference to Love affairs, to those who are buffoons, or are heretics or make their livelihood by displaying some sign (such as matted hair); the Devipurāṇa has not been utilized in this work, because it is not included in the enumeration of the number of Purāgas and Upapurāṇas ( in various works ), because it containg delusive aots 1406a and because it approves of heretic gāstras.

History of Dharmalāstra (Sec. IV, Oh. XZTI 

Some important conclussions can be drawn from the above mentioned remarks of Ballalasena in his Dānasāgara. Next to the Mitakṣarā, the Kṛtyakalpataru and Aparārka's commentary, the Dānasāgara is among the earliest extant nibandha works the dates of which are nearly certain. 1407 If does not mention the Mitāksarā, nor Kr̥tyakalpataru nor Aparārka. Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattācbārya is right in bis contention that the words 'Kalpa drumo jangamah' in the 3rd opening vorge have nothing to do with Kalpataru of Lakṣmidhara and that Prof. Rangaswamy Aiyangar is wrong in thinking that the verse refers to the Kalpataru ( vide Mr. Bhattācbārya's Introduction to Danasāgara p. XVIII and note 1). 

The principal points that emerge from Ballālasena's remarks on Purāṇas are that he included both Vāyu and Śiva among the principal Purāṇas (sometimes called Mahāpurāṇas), that there were two Purāṇas called Linga, Brahma, Āgney& and Viṣṇu, that the four counterparts bearing these names were not treated as authoritative (one pseudo-Lingapurāṇa having 6000 verses and one Vispu having also 23000 verses being unautho ritative), that he abhorred Tantrik rites and therefore totally discarded the Devipurāṇa and parts of Bhaviṣya, that he did not utilize three named sections of the Skanda, that he did not regard the Garuḍa as authoritative. It may be stated here that acc. to the printed) Kūrma I. 1. 17-20 some Upapurāpas such as Skanda, Vamana, Brahmānda and Nāradiya bear the same names as the Mahapuraṇas. Prof. Hazra relies upon a passage quoted from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa 1:08 by Kalpataru (Brahmacari

TATTE pp. XXV-XXVI. He composed three more works before the aia FITT viz. the HIT ( mentioned on pp. 52 and 59 of the HTT), afast सागर and आचारसागर (in verses 55-56 p. 6 of दानसागर). So पल्लालसेन'. literary activity should be placed between 1155 to 1180 A.D. He mentions अनिरुद्धभह, author of हारलता and पितृदयिता, as his guru to whom he shows great reverence for his learning, high character and attainments in the PPTATT (p. 2 verse 6) and states that he learnt the essence of all Purīṇas and scartis from him (verse 7). Vide H. of Dk. vol. I. (1930) pp. 340-341 for Ballālasena.

kāṇda p. 25) wherein it is said that the appellation Jaya is applied to 18 Puranas, Rāmāyaṇa, Vigpudharmādiśāstras, Śiva dharma, Mahābharata, Sauradharmas and Manayadharmas (Manusmrti?). I shall discuss the question of Viṣṇudharma purāṇa later. But I have serious objections against the antiquity and authenticity of this passage. Being quoted in the Kalpataru it may be earlier than 1050 A. D. That is all. In order to glorify the 18 Purāṇas the meaning of Jaya is extended. Jaya is applied only to the Mahābhārata in the latter e.g. Udyogaparva 136. 18-19 and Svargārohanika 5. 49 and 51 quoted in note 1369 above. Hence this passage was inserted very late after all 18 Purāṇas had been composed i.e. after the 9th century AD. Besides the plural Viṣṇudharmādiśāstrāṇi' shows that many works are meant and not one, i.e. the meaning is that all śāstras dealing with Viṣṇudharmas and the like. If a single work were meant, one expects 'Viṣṇudharmādiśāstram ca' and that would have not spoilt the metre. Besides, the Kalpataru itself indioates that this verse about 'Jaya' was cited by some authorities as * Smrti'. Therefore, it is doubtful if it is a genuine Bhaviṣya passage. Ballālasena mentions only eight Upapurāṇas on danas by name (including the four mentioned by the Matsya). 

In spite of the very admirable and praiseworthy efforts of Dr. Hazra in the matter of the place of the Upapurāṇas, their contents, the search among numerous mss. to find out what the text of the several apapurāṇas has been, the present writer must say here once for all that he does not at all agree with most of the dates that he assign to the Sāmba, the Vispadharma, the Viṣṇudharmottara, the Narasimhapurāṇa, which are the principal Upapurāṇas he has dealt with in the first volume of 'Studies in Upapurāṇas'. His dates for the four Upapurāṇas are;

Samba between 500 and 800 A..D. (p. 91), the Viṣṇudharma purāṇa between 200-300 A. D. (p. 143), the Viṣṇudharmottara purāpa between 400 to 500 A. D. (p. 212) and the present Narasimha-purāṇa between 400 to 500 A. D. To examine all his reasons the present writer would have to write another book. Therefore, he proposes to give only a few illustrations of the way in which Dr. Hazra arrives at his dates. But before this is done it is better to mention some of his own findings on the Purāṇas and the four Upapurāṇas mentioned above. On p. 27 he observes that the text of the extant Mahāpurāṇas which are the results of innumerable changes, modifications and interpola tions made at different times and by different sects is scarcely reliable and can be used with great caution and careful discrimination. I agree with him. But the same or perhaps worse is the case with the Upapurāṇas. Prof. Hazra himself says ("Studies' vol. I. p. 23) that after the group of 18 principal Purāṇas had been compiled many sub-systems and sects like the Sāktas and Sauras came into prominence and their adherents interpolated chapters in the 18 established Purāṇas and wrote new and independent works styled Purāṇas in order to propagate their own ideas and that some of these latter came to be called Upapurāṇas. The result is that, unless we have critical editions of the Purāṇas and the principal Upapurāṇas on the model of the critical edition of the Mahābhārata at the BORI in Poona, all chapters and often single verges are suspect. But the task of preparing critical editions of oven the principal Purāṇas and some of the Upapurāṇas based upon ancient and medieval mss. collected from all parts of India would be far more colossal and costly than even the critical edition of the Mahābhārata. Therefore, most chronological conclusions about the dates of Purāṇas and Upapurāṇas and about the borrowings of one Purana from another are just tentative at the most and likely to be set aside by new evidence as long as oritical editions of Puranas and Upapurāṇas are not available. 

Let us now turn to the four Upapurāṇas dealt with at longth by Prof. Hazra. About the Samba (which is one of the four Upapurāṇas expressly named in the Matsyapurāṇa 53. 60_63) Prof. Hazra observes ("Studies' vol. I. p. 68 ) that the present Samba-purāṇa consists of different units mostly belong ing to different countries and ages and after analysing in his Own way the several chapters of the Samba he arrives at the conclusion (on p. 93) that chapters 17, 22 and 23 of the printed 

Date of the Samba Purarā 

the 9th centur Matsya, but one about the Flood 

edition were added later than 950 A. D., that chap. 44-45 'wers inserted between 950 and 1050 A. D. and chap. 39-43 and 47-83 were added between 1250 and 1500 A. D. There is at present only one printed ed. of the Samba viz. that of the Vonk. Press in 84 chapters based probably only on one ms. Out of these 84 chapters Prof. Hazra himself finds that 47 chapters are later than 950 A. D., of which 4% were added between 1250-1500 A. D. Prof. Hazra has himaself examined several mass of the Samba, but they do not come from all over India, many being from Bengal and almost all seem to be late ones (p. 33 last line), being copied in saka 1764 i. e. 1842 A, D. When more than half of this Purana ranges between 950 to 1500 AD. according to Prof. Hazra, how can it be usefully employed for chronological purposes? Nobody can say when the verses about the four Upapurāṇas were inserted in tbe Matsya, but one can affirm that it was done about the 9th century A. D. or even later. Two datos about Upapurāṇas are certain, viz. that Samba is mentioned by Alberuni (Bachau, I. p. 130) who wrote in 1030 Å. D. and that the Dānasāgara (verses 13-15 on p. 3), composed in 1069 A.D. mentions eight Upapurāṇas on dānas of which four viz. Samba, Narasimha, Nandi and Aditya are the same as are mentioned in the Mataya. Therefore, an Upapurāpa called Samba must have been composed a century or two earlier than 1000 A. D. On p. 91 he holds that the Samba cannot be dated later than 800 A. D. It is difficult to fall in line with all the assumptions on pp. 90-91 for arriving at this date. What the Sāmba named by Matsya contained beyond the words story of Simba' is not at all known. Prof. Hazra himself has given up at least half of the printed Samba as later than 950 A. D. and there is absolutely 

no reliable evidence to hold that the remaining portion of the 

• Sāmba is earlier than 800 A. D. or even earlier than 950 A. D.. 

The next Upapurāṇa is Viṣṇudharma dealt with by Prof. Hazra in Studios' VOL I. pp. 118–155. There is no printed edition. Prof. Hazra (p. 119) refers to six mss. but he has chiefly used only one ms. viz. Bengal Asiatic Society's ms. No. 1670. This Purāpa has 105 chapters and over 4000 verses. Prof. Hazra admits (p. 119 ) that it has very little of the principal charac teristios of a Purāṇa and deals exclusively with the religious rites and duties of Vaiṣṇavas. Alberuni names Vis udharma but the verses that he quotes therefrom are found in the Viṣpu dharmottara as Būhler pointed out long ago (I A. VOL. XIX. pp. 381-410 and vide table given by Prof. Hazrs on p. 208 comparing the two ). Prof. Hazra holds (p. 116 ) relying on two verses quot 

8. D. 110 

History of Dharmasastra (Beo. IV, Ch. XXII 

ed below from Viṣṇudharmottara 1408a that the Viṣyudharnottara is only the latter part of Vispudharma and that, as he holds that the former was composed between 400-500 A. D., the date of the Virpudharma falls between 200 and 300 A. D. (p. 143 ). The other arguments that he advances are practically worthless. In the present author's opinion those verses can be interpreted in two other but different ways, viz. that the first section of the present Viṣṇudharmottara is called Viṣṇudharma or that the Viṣṇudharmottara is so called because it was composed after the Viṣṇupurāṇa, which contains the greatness of Viṣṇu and the dharmas of Vaiṣṇavas. He often trots out the theory that, if a work is free from Tantric elements, it must be an early work be. longing to the 3rd or 4th century A.D. (see p. 142). The Sarvada TS&Desangraha of Mādhavācārya (which was composed in the 14th century ) makes no reference to the cult of Sakti or the system of Tantra, though it devotes & good deal of space to the views of ovon Carvāka ( a thorough-going atheist), Bauddhas and Jainas. The Sarvasiddhāntasangraha also does not refer to the Sāktas or the Tantras. But no one can argue that Madhava is earlier than 4th or 5th century A.D. There may be various reasons for silence, One may ablor a thing and may not refer to it or use it at all as the Dānasāgara says about the Devipurāpa. The argument from silence is a slippery one. I challenge the whole basis of Prof. Hazra's date for Viṣṇudharma, viz. the date of the Viṣṇu. dharmottara. This last is a vast work in three sections. It would be proved later that portions of the latter Purina dealing

These verses are not clear enough for bolding that the present fūgUATTE IS only the latter part of another work called fenerā. That verse uses the word 

* which refers to the first section of the present favuru TER and refere only to one who studies the first section and also the following sections. The word a caboot be proved to resor to TUHETTA, which is nowhere ex pressly mentioned as a grop in the facourier. To take as referring to mener, a separate work, would be equal to assuming what has to be proved. Alberudi mentions Viṣṇudbarma as a short form of feugiat and nothing more. Similarly, in the 2nd passage it is expressly stated that is the first section the caseace of Vaiṣṇava duties is given along with the followiog two sections. · The Matsya ( 53. 16 ) speaks of the Viṣouparāṇa as one la which Parāsara proclaimed all the dharmas with reference to Vārāhakalpa; T eg.

The Viṣṇudharmotiara 

875 

with prognostications from dreams cannot be placed earlier than about 600 to 650 A. D. For the Viṣṇudharina we have to rely on what Prof. Hazra quotes. · Chap. 66 quotes the famous words of the Gitā whenever there is decline of dharma &c.' (p. 143 n. 94 ) and then the same chap. mentions the incarna tions of Viṣṇu including Buddha (p. 125 ). Therefore, the mention of the ten avatāras in the context of the words of the Gitā is natural and should not be regarded as spurious simply because it comes in the way of one's pet theories. On p. 144 be quotes ton versos from chapter 66 in which Buddha is described As son of Suddhodana and his doctrines are stated. Prof. Hazra (on pp 145–146) gives four reasons which are quite unconvincing. The Purāṇas mention the avatāras of Viṣṇu in several places. The Bhāgavata in I 3 names 22 avatāras. On p. 150 Prof. Hazra himself quotes a long passage about the evils of the Kali age from the Viṣṇudharma in which occurs a signifioant half verse 'utkocaḥ saugatās-caiva Mahāyānaratās-tathā'. Hore not only are the followers of Buddha mentioned but also those who are of the Mahāyāna persuasion. On p. 124 Prof. Hazra states that the Viṣṇudharma (p. 124 11. 45 ) mentions by name 33 authors of Dharmaśāstras, besides the Saptarsis and others. Yāj. (1. 4-5) mentions only 19 promulgators of Dharmaśāstra (including himself and holding Saṅkha-likhita as one ). Both the Viṣṇu dharma and the Viṣṇudharmottara are not mentioned by the Matsya. Therefore, it must be held that they were not reca gnized as Upapurāṇas at the time when the verses about Upa purāgas were interpolated in the Matsya and were not so recog. nized till at least the 8th or 9th century A. D. The Viṣṇudbarma is opposed to what is stated by all writers from the Grhya and Dharmasūtras, by Manu (III. 128–186 ), by Matsya, Kūrma and other Purāṇas about the qualifications of the brahmaṇas to be invited at a sraddha dinner ( vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 384-387). It expressly says that squint-eyed, bunch-backed, impotent, poor and diseased brāhmaṇas should be mixed up at a śrāddha along with those who are deeply versed in the Veda, 1409 This does not bespeak an early date. (On p. 138 Prof. Hazra refers to several nibandhakāras as quoting from Viṣpudharms such as Gadadhara up to Ballālasena, Aparārka and Kṛtyakalpataru. These do not carry the data beyond 1000 A. D. and besides an examination of quotations in only one work ( Aparārka) will show that the

Viṣṇudharma was an botoh-potoh bringing together passages from several souroes ( vide note ). 1410 Prof. Hazra himself holda that the original Viṇpudharma was appropriated and recast by Bhagavatas and that many verses quoted from Vispudharma by Raghunandana, Govindānanda and the Madanapīrijata do not occur in the present work ( pp. 154-155 ). 

Then we come to the Vizpudharmottara. The only printed edition is that of the Venk. Press. It is a vast work divided into three sections. The first deals with geography, solar and lunar dynasties, astronomy and astrology, gotra and pravara, śrāddhas, Manvantaras, Bharata's fight with Gandharvas and Satrughoa's with Lavana. The 2nd section deals with various aspects of Rāja dharma and the third section of the Purāpa deals with Citrasūtra vidhāna and contains several topics such as painting, dancing, music, song, ragas, riddles, dramaturgy, metrics, figures of speech, construction of images, building of temples, symptoms of approaching death, gifts of various kinds, law and justice, hermits and sanngāsins. On p. 212 Dr. Hazra places this Purana bet ween 400-500 A. D. Reasons of limitations of space preclude any detailed criticism of Prof. Hazra's treatment. In III, 351.54 Buddha ia mentioned as an avatāra which Prof. Hazra says is 'most probably spurious' (p. 212) and advances no reasons for this summary judgment. He puts in his usual argument of its non Tantric 1411 character and frequent use of the word prādurbhava

details. Whaizes attaches uncha 

and not avatara' which lattor, he says, occurs in two places only. Prof. Hazre often attaches undue importance to insignificant details. Whether the word 'prādurbhava' is used or 'ayatāra' is used matters little. The same Purāpa uses both words promise uously e. 8. Narasitaha (36. 1, 'avatarāpaham yaksye') begins with the word 'avatāra ' and in 39, 1 employs the word 'prādar bhāva'(ataparam Hareḥ puṇyam prādurbbāvam) and in the colophons of all chapters from 36 to 53 the word 'prādurbhāya' is used. The Matsya 247, 1 starts with 'prādurbhāvān para poṣu Viṣporamitatejasaḥ'. In 247. 19-21 the Matsya employs the word ' avatirpah 'with regard to Vamana and Nṛsimha and in 246, 4 avatirgo jagadyonih "** **Vāinanonoha rūpona &c.'. Padma V. 13. 182 speaks of twelve avatāras; Vispu V. 16 also uges the word 'ayatāra! On p. 199 he gives a table of passages that are common to Manu, Yaj., Nārada und Vispudharmottara, OD P. 200 another table of passages common to Bharata's Natya Sāstra and Viṣṇudbarmottara, and on page 202 a table of paggages common to Matsya and Viṣpudharmottara end holds that the Matsya borrows. This is a most astounding proposition The Matsya does not even mention the Viṣoudharmottara as an Upaparāṇa; the only gure and earliest date is that the latter is mentioned by Alberuni. That does not carry the matter beyond 900-1000 A. D. The Matsyapurāpa might have been tampered with. The reasons assigned for his opinion by Prof. Hazra are, to say the least, flimsy and unconvincing. It is further to be noted that there are twelve verses that state that some phenomena are not to be held to be utpātas, that are common to Matsya 229. 14-25, Viṣṇudharmottara ( II. 134. 15-26 ) and the Bṛbatsarghita ( 45. 83-94), which are quoted by the Adbhutasāgars pp. 743-744 as occurring in all these three and in Bārhaspatya. I have dealt with this matter above on p. 768 n 1240. Varāha states that these

verses are the summaries (rsiputrakrtaih slokair-vidyād-etat samasoktaih) of the slokas of Rṣiputra. Therefore, the view that they are borrowed by Varāba from the Matsya or Vispudharmo ttara would be out of question. The two Purāṇas do not say whence they have taken them. Therefore, it would not be unjustifiable to hold that in both Purāṇas the verges of the Bphat-samhita were inserted. There is another circumstance that strengthens this last view. The Adbhutasāgara on pp. 493-494 quotes geven verses from the Bșhad-yātrā of Varāba alone. These verses are quoted by Utpala on Br, S. 47. 2% (where Varāba says 'sadasat - Svapnanimittam yātrāyām svapnavidhir-uktaḥ) from Yatrā'. These verses ( 8 in all) are Varāha's own (as he says) and not taken from any other source. Three of these verses on dreams occur in the Viṣṇudharmottara (II. 176. 9-11). They are quoted above on p. 776 note 1254. Prof. Hazra does not appear to have carefully gone into the several works of Varāhamihira and is not right when he says (on pp. 201 and 211 ) that the Viṣṇudharmottara does not refer to or utilize the works of Varābamihira'. The Viṣṇu dbarmottara is an encyclopaedia, while Varāhamihira was & great astronomer and astrologer. He would turn to his predecessors in his own subject if he wanted to borrow and he expresaly mentions numerous predecessors (vide pp. 591-594 above) and not to an Upapurāṇa (which in my viow did not exist or at least was not recognised as an authority when Varāba wrote in the first half of the 6th century A. D.) Besides, the presumption to be drawn from the nature of the Upapurāṇa is in favour of bolding that it borrows. 

Prof. Hazra deals with the Narasimha-purāṇa on pp. 219-266 of his 'Studies' vol. I. The only printed edition is that published in 1911 by Gopal Narayan and Co. (Bombay) in 68 chapters based on three mss. about which no information is given This Purana appears to have been composed solely for the glorification of Nara simha identified with Nārāyana. Prof. Hazra has used several msa., two, the oldest, being dated in saka 1567 ( i.e. 1645 A. D.), some of the others are not dated and a few are dated so late as 1798 A. D. and 1810 A. D.; and some are written in Bengali soript. On p. 322 Prof. Hazra says about one mg. in Eggeling's oat, of India Ofice mags, that it was copied about 1500-1600 AD. and its last five folios were supplied in 1789 A. D. No reasons are given why this ms. should be regarded as being copied between 1500 1600. This is probably a guess, so all the mss. consulted are not earlier than the 17th and following centuries.

agree with the printed edition in the number of chapters and also lack oertain chapters of the printed edition. Prof. Hazra holds (p. 242) OR.various grounds, all of which cannot be examined hore, that the present Narasimbapurāṇa is to be placed between 400-500 A D.' One or two of his characteristic arguments will be noticed here. In chap. 36. 9 (kalau prāpte yathā Buddho bhaven-Nārāyaṇaḥ prabhuḥ) Buddha is mentioned; Mārkan. deya promises in chap. 36 to narrate stories about eloven avatāras ( among whom Balarama, Kyspa and Buddha are included) and in chapters 37-54, the stories of all avatāras except Buddha are given and it is added 1412 in chap. 54 that I have spoken of the ton incarnations of Viṣn. The devotee of NȚsimha who always listens to these attains Vispu'. It may be noted that Balabhadra is mentioned in a half verse (36. 8) which is found only in ms. 'ga' of the three mss. of the printed edition. In ohap. 53 a fow exploits of Balarama and Krsna are narrated in the same chapter and so the half line was inserted later. As the story of Buddha is not given Prof. Hazra holds that the verse in 36. 9 is undoubtedly spurious (pp. 230 and 249). It never occurred to Prof. Hazra that the sectarian zeal of & bigoted Vaiṣṇava might have never cared to give the life of Buddha who was not concerned with (but was antagonistic to ) the varpa system and the Vedas or might have omitted the story of the life of Buddha even if it oocurred in the ms. from which he copied. The prosent author thinks that 36.9 is a genuine verse and enumerates Buddha as an avatāra following the universal belief held in India at least from the 9th or 10th century A. D. that Buddha was an avatāra, but probably bigotry led to the omission of the details of Buddha's life. Besides, the verse is capable of another interpretation. It is only the stories of ten avatāras (excluding Buddha) that lead & devoted to Visgu. A devotee may worship any one of Nṛsimba, Rāma or Krona, and reach Vispu, but hardly any orthodox work has ever stated that worship of Buddha alone (an avatara) will load to attainment of Viṣṇu. Therefore, it is proper to hold that the story of Buddha's life might not have been given at all or was purposely omitted. On. p. 239 Prof. Hasra pats forward a peculiar argument. According to the Narasimha-parāṇa obap. 53. 31. says Prof. Hazra, Kroṇa embodies only a part of Viṣṇu's sakti 1413 and therefore the Narasimha is to be dated

earlier than the present Bhagavata in which Kropa is called bhagavān himself (Bhagavata I. 3. 28). As the present Bhaga vata is to be dated in the 6th century A. D. the Narasimha is to be placed not later than 300 A D.' Great controversies have raged over the date of the Bhagavata. The present author holds that the Bhagavata-purāpa does not belong to the 6th century A. D. It will be shown below that while Rāmānuja quotes more than a hundred verses from the Viṣṇupurāpa, which he regarded as one of supreme authority over other Purāṇas (in Vedārtbasangraha pp. 141-142 of D. C. edition) he does not quote the Bhāgavata at all in his bhāsya on the Vedāntasūtra. A bigoted devotee of Narasimha may say that Narasimha avatāra is the perfect avatāra of Viṣṇu, while Krspa is only a partial one. But surely that cannot determine the dates of the respective purāpas. What bigoted devotees are capable of saying may be seen from Brahmāṇda III. 36. 18-20 quoted later io this section, where it is asserted that the reward of repasting thrice the thousand names of Viṣṇu is yielded by repeating one name of Kṭspa once. The strongest argument against the authenticity and early date of the present Nara simhapurāpa has not been properly and adequately emphasized or appreciated by Prof. Hazra. The Matsya (53.60-63) gives meagre details about the four Upapurāṇas expressly named by it, but about the Narasimha it makes one definite statement that it contained 18000 verses (53.60). The present Narasimha contains only about 3400 verses,1414 Therefore, the old Nara simhapurāṇa exists no more and in its place a new one has been substituted, probably containing some of the topics and chapters contained in the old one. We do not know the extent of the Narasimha mentioned by Alberuni. For ought we know he might have referred to the old extensive purāpa or the new stripling substituted in its place. Even some of the mss. copied in comparatively recent times drop several chapters of the printed purāṇa ; on p. 249 Prof. Hazra holds that chapters 34 verses 43-55, and chapters 61, 65 (on 68 holy places for Vaiṣṇavas ), 66,67 are genuine parts, though dropped in 

1414. Even a late writer like f o r patronized by the Gajapati king Mukundadeva (1559-1568 A. D.) says ia bis agrargai (B. I, ed.) vol. I. P. 18 ' THETY UTCATHEWHEY quo mortua Pena Filo THICGRATH Panai?. It further says that the Naadi or Naada parāṇa is a part of Skanda and that, since Laksmidbara says that the Kālikā is an Upes porāṇa, those tbat say that by the word Bhagavata the Kālikā is meant une wrong and then soumerates the 18 s,

some mes. Prof. Hazra's judgments on various matters are most liable to be challenged; but considerations of space prevent any detailed treatment. On p. 252 he holds that in chap. 6 the story of the birth of Vasistha and Agastya as the song of Mitra and Varuṇa, the story of Yana and Yaml are comparatively late additions. The story of the birth of Vasistha from Urvasi and Mitra and Varuṇa is alluded to even in the Rgveda ( VII. 33. 11 ) and in the previous verse ( 10 ) of the same hymn Vasistha, Agastya and Mitrāvarunau are brought together. The story of Yama and Yami occurs in Rg. X. 10. The Narasimha itself states ( in chap. 14 1 ) that the story of Yama and Yami is Vaidiki. The Purāṇa may have added some fringes and embellishments, but the main theme is the same in both. On p. 254–255 and note 330 Prof. Hazra was constrained to admit that the Narasimha purāpa had been revised more than onco, remarks that Hemādri had a more extensive purāṇa before him than the printed one and that a comparison of the verges quoted from the Narasimha purāṇa by the Madanapārijāta pp. 301-302, Smrtitattva on āhnika (vol. I. p. 411 ) and Nityācārapradipa (vol. I p. 617) show that the text of the Narasimha used by Raghunandana and Narasimha-vājapeyin agrees more with the printed text than the text used by Madanapāla (about 1375 A, D.), less than 200 years before Raghunandana. 

The extant Narasimhapurāṇa is an insignificant one as compared with the principal Purāṇas like Vāyu, Matsya, Vispu; the Sāmba is not quoted at all by Aparārka, the Viṣṇudharma only twice and even the Viṣṇudharmottara is quoted by Aparārka only 7 times for about 25 perses in all. The very ex tensive digest Kalpataru (first half of 12th century A. D.) contains hardly any quotation from Viṣṇudharmottara on vratas (though the latter devotes about 1600 verses to vratas), nor is it quoted in the sections on brahmacāri and other kāndas, while hundreds of verses are quoted from Matsya, Brahma, Bhaviṣya, Mārkapdeys and other Purāṇas. Aparārka in his huge digest of 1252 printed pages quotes the Narasimhapurāpa only 9 times and in all about 30 verses only, of which about half are in respect of sannyāsa, while the Brahmapurāṇa is quoted 68 times for hundreds of verses, the Matsya is quoted over 50 bi nes for several hundred verses. The Tulasi plant is now sacred to the devotees of Viṣṇu, but it does not figure in early Paurāpika or other literature. It is mentioned in chapters

History of Dharma tāstra (Sec. IV, Ch. XXII 

31. 87 ( in & proge passage ) and 34 ( 19 and 23 ) of the printed Narasimhapurāṇa. As usual Prof. Hazra holds these references are due to later revisions and should not be held to suggest a late date for the extant Narasimhapurāṇa (p. 255 ). Tulasi. māhātmya is very much in evidence in the Padma e. g. in IV. 94. 4-10, V. 58. 109ff and V. 59, VI, 24, 2-43. The very late part of Padma VI (chap. 98-107 ) contains the story of Jālandhara, whose wife Vļodā is said to have become Tulasi. Prof. Hazra fails to realize the full force of his own admission that the Narasimha was revised several times and that writers of the 16th century had a version before them different from that before the writers of the 13th or 14th century. In the author's opinion the whole Furāṇa becomes suspect and that by mere diplomatio criticism one would not be able to support beyond doubt any chronological conclusion derived from the present truncated and garbled version of the original Narasimhan 

So much space had to be devoted to an examination of Prof. Hazra's work on the Upapurāṇas for cogent reasons. His is the latest and most elaborate treatment of Purāṇas and parti cularly of Upapurāṇas, on which he has bestowed immense labour. His opinions, particularly about the dates of the Upapurāṇas, are likely to be taken as the last word on the subject and even his unfounded surmises are likely to be taken as well-established conclusions. Modern Sanskrit scholars have sad experience about such matters. Max Muller, working back from the date of Buddha and assigning arbitrarily two hundred years each for three periods viz. the Upaniṣad period, the Brāhmaṇa period and the Samhitā period, inferred that the composition of the Vedas was to be assigned to a period about 1200 B. C. Ho no doubt said that his periods were the minimum and that his was a pure surmise. Yet most writers who have not themselves made a deep study of the Veda assign the Vedas to about 1200 to 1400 B. O, even after the lapse of about one hundred years from the time when Max Muller launched his surmises. For example, Prof. Toynbee in the table of the time spans of the growth phases of civilizations on p. 758 of volume IX (1954) gives the dates of Epiphany and of breakdown of the Indic civilization as 1375 B.C. and 725 B. O. rospectively. The present author does not at all agree with the datos assigned to the Upapurāṇas by Prof. Hazra and with the methods and reasoning adopted for arriving at those dates. He had to perform this painful duty even in spite of his regard 

for Prof. Hazra.

The translations of Viṣṇu and Mārkandeya were made respectively by H. H. Wilson and Pargiter; Prof. Kirfel's Introduction to 'Purāṇa panoalaksana" (1927, Bonn) was translated in the Journal of the Shri Venkataśa Institute, vol. VII pp. 81-121 and vol.

I vol. 14 p. 338 ) speaks of him as knowing the essence of many sāstras, Itibāsa and Purāṇas' (probably in 6th century A. D.); Purāṇas are mentioned as studied in 578 A. D. ( in E. I. vol. 28 p. 59 ). 

In the following notes on individual Puranas and Upapurāṇas the author adds a few notes based on his own study of the Puranas and (printed) digests ( nibandhas ) of an early age. He desires to emphasize that the earliest works that can be called digeste and are available in print cannot be placed earlier than about 1100 A. D. Though there is difference of viows among scholars about the exact datos of composition, the Mitaksarā, the Kityan kalpataru (which is a regular Digest of various kinds of materials on Dharmaśāstra) and Aparārka's work (though in

form a commentary on Yajnavalkya-smrti is still in the nature of a Digest) are three printed works more or less contemporary and composed between about 1100 to 1140 A.D. The Kṛtya kalpataru on Vyavabāra mentions by name Prakāsa, Hala yudha, Kamadhenu and Pārijāta. Besides, Krityakalpataru ( Niyata p. 280) cites the explanation of Parārska (in Āp. Dh, S. I. 17. 26 ) by the Smrtimañjari ( of Govindarāja ) and also on śrāddha ( pp. 46 and 259 ). It has been shown in H. of Dh. vol. I that Prakāśa (pp. 306-308 ), Pārijāta (pp. 308–309), Smrtimañjari (pp. 312–314 ) were works of the digest genre. The Kāmadhenu of Gopāla also appears to have been a digest (H. of Dh. Vol. I. pp. 293 ff.). The author Gopāla was a friend of Laksmidhara (vide Introd. to Dānaka ada p. 49), but, since the latter employs the past tense (cakre) with reference to Gopala's work and the present tense ( tanyate kalpavrkṣaḥ) as regards his own work it follows that the Kamadhenu was composed at least a few years before the Kalpa taru. As no m88, of the Prakāsa, Pārijāta and Kamadhenu are available it is impossible to say anything about their exhaus tiveness or otherwise. But from the summary at the end of the ms. on the Prāgascitta section of the Smrtimañjari (H. of Dh. vol. I. p. 312 note 714) it appears that it must have been fairly large and was composed on the same lines as the later Kftya kalpataru, since it began with Paribhāṣākānda and Brahmacāri section, then dealt with Gṛbasthadbarmas, Dana, Suddhi and Āśauca, Srāddha, then with Vānaprastha and Pravrajya (corresponding to the mokṣakānda of Kalpataru ) and ended with Prāyaścittas. These predecessors of the Kalpataru wore superseded by the extensive work of Lakṣmidhara, who himself receded into the background when the works of Hemadri, Candesvara, Madanaratna, the Vtramitrodaya, the Mayūkhas of Nilakantha became popular, Even before the Kamadhenu and probably the Smstimañjari also, Bhoja (about 2nd quarter of 11th century A. D.) composed (or patronised the composition of) several works such as the Bhujabala and Rajamārtaṇḍa which exhaustively dealt with the astrological requirements of sainskūras from pursavana to marriage and also of vratas, yatra, śāntis, pratiṣtha (vide the author's paper on 'King Bhoja and his works on Dharmaśāstra and astrology'in JOR, (Madras), vol. XXIII for 1953-54 pp. 94-127 for five works of Bhoja). So there was nothing very novel in the Kftyakalpataru except its exhaustive and logical treatment of all topics and profuse quotations from the Epics and Purāṇas. The Mitakgara does

885 

not quote much from the Puranas, but Aparārka and Kalpataru quote them profusely. The Kalpataru quotes about 600 verses from Dovipurana, over 200 verses each from Kalika, Aditya purāṇa, Nandipurāpa and Narasimhapurāṇa (all Upapuranas) while it quotes none at all from Viṣṇudbarmottara. The Kalpataru did not probably regard it as authoritative, though Aparārka and the Dānasāgara utilized it to some extent. The learnod editor of the extensive Kalpataru, Prof. Aiyangar, has made great efforts to identify the quotations therein from the Purāṇas, and laid all workers and scholars under great obliga tions. But many quotations have eluded him as will be shown later on. He has been assiduous in pointing out how Hemādri, Candeśvara and Mitramiśra have copied wholesale' from the Kalpataru. It is not impossible that even the Kalpataru might have done the same to some extent as regards its predecessors such as the Pārijāta, Prakāśa, Smrtimañjari, and Kamadhenu. But as those works are not yet available, no positive conclusion can be drawn about its borrowing for the present 

The present author edited 286 verses from the Rājamārtaṇḍa (containing 1462 verses) on tithis, vratas and utgavas in ABORI YOL 36, parts III-IV, 1956, pp. 306-339,). It describes geveral vratas and utgavas like Indradhvajotthapana and the work is about 75 years older than the Kalpataru. The Kalpataru is studiously silent as regards Bhoja, though it mentions Kama dhenu, Govindarāja, Prakāśa and Halāyudha and it hardly any. where mentions the vratas described by the Rājamārkanda. The Mitākṣarā does mention Dhāreśvara Bhoja. Probably Lakṣmidhara did not like that a comparison should be instituted between his treatment of vratas and Bhoja's. 

Alberuni's work on India translated by Sachau furnishes us with some data about the chronology of Purāṇas. On p. 130 (of Sachau's tr.) he says he heard the following as the Purāṇas viz. Ādi, Matsya, Kūrma, Varāba, Narasimha, Vamana, Vāyu, Nanda, Skanda, Aditya, Soma, Samba, Brahmānda, Mārkaṇdaya, Tārksya (i.Garuḍa ), Viṣṇu, Brahma, Bhaviṣya. It will be noted that he mixes in this list Purāvas and Upapurāṇas. He further states that he had seen only portions of Matsya, Aditya and Vayu. Then on p. 131 ( of Sachau's tr.) there is another list which was read to him from the Viṣṇu (viz. the 18 principal Purāṇas, Śaiva being substituted for Vāyu ). Then, on p. 229 (of Sachau's tr. ) he sets out from Aditya some details about the regions below the earth and shows how Vāyu differs from it and 

888 

History of Dharmaśāstra (seo, IV, Ch. xtit 

on p. 248 he sets out details about Meru from Viṣṇu, Vayu and Aditya. As he wrote his work in 1030 A. D. one has to conclude that Purāpas having the names oited by him existed some time before 1000 A. D. at the latest. 

Some of the papers of Prof. Hazra and others on the princi pal Puranas and on some of the Upapurāṇas are brought together in one place by Dr. Pusalkar in his work Studies in Epics and Purāṇas' pp. 218–225; a few of them are mentioned here.
