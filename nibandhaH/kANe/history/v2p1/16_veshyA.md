CHAPTER XVI 

VESYA 

Vesya-(Courtezan). This work dealing among other matters with the position of women and marriage in India would be incomplete if nothing were said about prostitutes and concubines. Prostitution has existed from the dawn of history in all countries and in the absence of statistics it is difficult to say whether it flourished more in one country than in another or whether it existed to a greater or lesser extent in ancient days as compared with modern times. The artiole in the Enoyolopædia Britannica on prostitution will be an eye-opener to many who will be inclined to turn their nose at Indian conditions. 

From the Rgveda we find that there were women who were common to several mon i, e. who were courtezans or prostitutes In Rg. I. 167. 4 the bright Maruts ( storm gods ) are said to have become associated with the young (lightning), just as men become associated with a young courtezan. 1591 It has already been seen how in Rg. II. 29. 1 reference is made to a woman who gives birth in secret to a child and leaves it aside. In Rg. I. 66. 4, L. 117. 18, I. 134. 3 and other places jāra (paramour or secret lover ) is spoken of. In Gaut. XXII. 27 it is said that for killing a woman who is a brāhmaṇi by birth only and who subsists by harlotry no prāya citta is necessary but eight hand. fule of corn may be gifted. Manu IV, 209 forbids & brabmana from taking food offered by harlots (vide also IV. 219); and Manu IX 259 requires the king to punish clever (or deceitful ) harlots. In the Mahabbārata courtezans are an established institution. The Adiparva (115, 39 ) narrates how a vesy & waited upon Dhstarāṣtra when his wife Gandhari was pregnant.149 In the Udyogaparva ( 30. 38) Yudhisthira sends greetings to the vetyās of the Kauravas. Courtezans are describ. ed as going out to welcome Krsna when he came on a mission of peace to the Kaurava court (Udyoga 86. 15 ). When the Pandava armies are described as about to start for battle it

is said that oarts, markets and courtezans also accompanied them (Udyoga 151. 58). Vide also Vanaparva 239, 37, Karnaparva 94. 26. Yāj. "498 II. 290 divides concubines into two sorts, avaruddha ( one who is kept in the house itself and forbidden to have intercourse with any other male ) and bhujisya ( concubine who is not kept in the house, but elsewhere and is in the special keeping of a person ) and prescribes a fine of fifty paṇas against another person having intercourse with them. Nārada 1494 (stripumsa, 78-79 ) says 'intercourse is permitted with wanton women (svairipi) who are not brahmana by caste, with a prostitute, a female slave, or a female not restrained by her master, if these belong to a caste lower than oneself; but it is forbidden with women of superior caste. But when these very women are the kept mistresses ( of a person ) intercourse with them by a stranger is as much a crime as intercourse with another's wife. Such women must not be approached, though intercourse with them is not forbidden ( on the ground of caste &o ), since they belong to another.' On Yāj. II. 290 the Mit., after quoting the Skandapurāṇa to the effect that prostitutes constitute a separate caste being sprung from certain Apsurases (heavenly nymphs ) called pañicacūdās, states that such courtezans as are not kept specially by a person do not inour any sin, nor punishment at the hands of the king, if they have intercourse with men of the Bame or & superior caste, nor do men approaching them incur any penalty if they are not avaruddha. But the men who visit tbem incur sin ( which is an unseen result ), since the smṛtis ordain that men should be devoted to their wives ( vide Yāj. I. 81) and the prājāpatya penance is presoribed for him who has intercourse with a vesyā (vide Atri v. 271). Nārada 14% (vetanasyanapakarma 18 ) lays down that if a public woman after getting her fee refuses to receive the customer, she shall pay twice the amount of the fee and the same fine shall be imposed on a man who does not pay the ( stipulated ) fee, after having had interoourse with a veśyā. Vide Yāj. II. 292 and Matayapurāṇa 227. 144-145 for

similar provisions. The Matsyapuriṇa chap. 70 dilates upon vesyādbarma. The Kāmasūtra I. 3. 20 defines a gañikā as a veśyā who is most accomplished and proficient in the 64 kalās, Apararka (p. 800, on Yāj. II. 198 ) quotes Nārada (cited above) and several verses of the Matsyapurāṇa about vesgās. 

Concubines being recognized by society, the smýtis provided for their maintenance. During the life-time of a person keeping a concubine, the latter has no legal right to proceed against tbe former. Nārada ( dāyabbāga 1996 52 ) and Katyayapa lay down that even when the property of a deceased person escheats to the king for want of heirs ( except in the case of the deceased being a brāhmana ) the king has first to provide for the main. tenance of the concubines of the deceased, of his slaves and for his grāddbas. The Mit. says that tbe concubines bere referred to are those oalled avaruddhā (and not bhujiṣya ) and that even the kept mistresses of a deceased brāhmaṇa are entitled to maintenance from his property. The Privy Council in Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai have gone beyond the Mit. and have held that all concubines (whether kept in the house practically as members of the family i. e. avaruddhā or not so kept i.e. bhujigyā ) within the exclusive keeping of a Hindu till his death are entitled to maintenance from his property after his death, provided they are continuously chaste thereafter, W17 

The rights of the illegitimate children of concubines to inheritance or maintenance will be dealt with later on under inheritance. 

Out of the samskāras enumerated above (pp. 195–197), the Mahāyajñas, Utsarjana and Upākarma will be described under the next chapter, viz. āhnika and antyeṣti under fauce.
