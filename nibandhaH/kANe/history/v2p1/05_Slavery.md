CHAPTER V 

SLAVERY 

Slavery has existed as a constant element in the social and economioal life of all nations of antiquity such as Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome and also of many nations of Europe. "20 It was however left to such Christian Dations of the West as England and the United States of America to carry on the institution of slavery in the most horrible manner possible never dreamt of by any nation of antiquity, viz. by sending out kidnapping expeditions to Africa to collect slaves, to huddle them in ships in such unspeakably filthy conditions that half of them died on the voyage, to sell them to plantation owners and others like chattel. Westermarck in his Origin and Development of the moral ideas' vol. I (1912) p. 711 was constrained to observe This system of slavery, which at least in the British colonies and slave states surpassed in cruelty the slavery of any pagan country ancient and modern, was not only recognised by Christian Governments but was supported by the large bulk of the clergy, Catholic and Protestant alike.' Slavery was abolished in the British Dominions only in 1833 and in British India by Act V of 1843. 

It has been seen above (pp. 26-27) that the word 'dāsa' in the Rg. generally stands for the opponents of the dryas. It is possible that when the dāsas were vanquished in battle and taken prisoners they were treated as slaves. In the Rgveda, however, there are not many passages where the word dasa' can be said to have been used in the sense of slave. In Rg VIII. 56. 3 421 we

That slavory already was established as & recognized institution in the Sumorian culturo of the Babylonian aron in the 4th millenium B. C. may be confidently assumed from the frag ments of Sumerian legislation upon slaves which date from the first halt of the 3rd millonium'.

read thou madest a gift to me of one hundred donkeys, of one hundred fleece-bearing ewes and one hundred dāsas'. It appears that here daga means slaves or serfs. In Rg VIII. 5.38 the sage praises his patron Caidya Kasu 'the common people sit down at the feet of Caidys Kaśu like men crowding round tanners of hides, (Caidya ) who honoured me by giving me ten noblemen that were like gold in appearance'. Here probably there is an allusion to the gift of ten captured nobles made to the sage by Caidya Kaśu, the victor. A sage declares in Rg. VIII. 19. 36 *Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, gave me fifty young women', This probably refers to the gift of female slaves ( dagla). The Tai. S. VII. 5. 10. 1 says "dāsis ( girl slaves ) place on their heads jars full of water and singing this madhu and beating their feet against the ground dance round the mārjāliya' &o.428 The Tai. S. II. 2. 6. 3. refers to the gift of a horse or a male (slave ). 'He obtains a portion of himself who accepts ( in gift) a being with two rows of teeth, ( suoh as ) a horse or a human male; on accepting an animal with two rows of teeth one should offer to Vaiśvānara a mess cooked on twelve potsherds * 428 The Ait. Br. 39.8 mentions large gifts such as 10,000 girls (dāsi) and 10,000 elephants made by a king to his purohita performing coronation. When the angel of Death tries to dissuado Naoiketas from his curiosity to know the destiny of a person after death, he tempts the inquirer ( Katha Up. I. 1.25). Here are such handsome women with chariots and musical instruments as cannot be secured ( ordinarily ) by men; make them, when gifted by me, serve you; do not ask me what happens after death'. The women referred to were probably meant to be serving (or slave ) girls who attended on a man as maids and who could dance and sing. In the Bṭ. Up. IV. 4. 23 Janaka after receiving instruotion in Brahmavidyā from Yajñavalkya exclaims' I make a gift to your honour of the Videhas together with myself for being your slavo'. We read in the Chan. Up. * In this world they speak of cows and horses, elephants and gold, wives and slaves, fields and houses as mahimā (greatness).

Vide also Chan, Up. V. 13.2 and Bf. Up. VI. 2.7 for references to dasis. These passages show that in the Vedic period men and women had become the subjects of gifts and so were in the condition of slaves. 

Though Manu ordained (I. 91, VIII. 413, 414 ) that the principal duty of the sūdra was to wait upon the three higher castes or that the gūdra was created by the Creator for the service of brāhmaṇas, the sūdra who thus served a dvijāti ag & duty was not his slave. Jaimini (VL 7. 6 )424 makes this perfectly clear by saying that when a man makes & gift in the Viśvajit sacrifica of everything belonging to himself he cannot make a gift of the sūdra who waits upon him as his duty. Sabara in his bhagya adds the sūdra may not desire to serve the man to whom the sacrificer gives his all and the latter has no power over him if he is unwilling.' 

We have seen how the Gșhya Sūtras speak of dāsas being employed to wash the feet of honoured guests. It appears that the ideal placed before the masters was to treat the slave humanely. Ap. Dh. 8. II. 4. 9. 11485 says that opo may indeed stint oneself, one's wife or son (as to food) if guests come, but never & dāsa who does one's menial work (or & dāsa and hired servants). In the Anuśāsana parva*26 it is stated 'one should not sell a human being who is a stranger; how much more one's own children'. In the Mahabhārata gifts of dāsas and dasis are very frequently men tioned. In Sabhāparva 52, 45, Vanaparv: 233, 43 and Virāts 18. 21 gifts of 30 dāsis to each of 88000 snātaka brāhmaṇas are spokon of. In Vanaparva 185. 34 Vainya is said to bave given a thousand handsome dāsis with ornaments on to Atri. Vide Dronaparya 57.5-9. Manu (VIII. 299-300) places a slave on the same level as one's son in the matter of corporal punish ment' the wife, the son, the slave, & menial servant, one's full brother--these when guilty of wrong may be beaten with a rope

Slavery was probably not much 487 in evidence in India in the 4th century B. O, or the treatment of slaves in India was 80 good that a foreign observer like Megasthenes acoustomed to the treatment of slaves in Greece thought that there was no slavery. Megasthenes ( MacCrindle, p. 71 ) states that none of the Indians employs slaves ( vide Strabo XV. 1. 54). That slavery existed then admits of no doubt. The Emperor Asoka when proclaiming his Law of Piety enjoins in his 9th Rock Edict that the Law of Piety consists ( among other things ) in the kind (or proper) treatment of slaves (dāsas ) and hired servants. In the Arthaśāstra (III. 13 ) Kautilya *28 gives very important provisions about slaves. He says that the mleochas are not punishable if they sell or plenge their children, but an Arya cannot be reduced to slavery. He then prescribes that if a relative sells or pledges a sūdra ( who is not born as a slave ) or & vaisya or ksatriya or a brāhmaṇa (all being minors), he should be respectively fined 12, 24, 36 and 48 paṇas and that if & stranger sells or pledges the above then the vendor, the vendee and the abettors will be liable to the first, middle and highest ammercements and whipping respectively (i. e, first emmerce ment for sale of a sūdra by a stranger and whipping for the sale of a brahmana). But he allows the pledge of even an arya in family distress. He refers to several kinds of slaves viz. dhvajāhsta (captured in battle ), atmavikrayin (who sells himself), udaradāsa (or garbhadāsa, one who is born to a dāsi from a slave ) or those so made for a debt (abitika ), or for a fine or court's deoree (daṇdapranita ). He then prescribes how they are set free from slavery. One who sells himself or is pledged or is born a slave becomes a free man by paying off respectively the amount for which he was purchased or pledged or what would be a proper price. One who is made a slave for a fine may pay off the fine by doing work. One captured in war may become free by paying socor ding to the time he has been in bondage and the work he did or by paying half of it. The child of one who sells himself

History of Dharmasastra i Ch. remains an arya ( free man). He prescribes that if a master makes a pledged slave carry a corpse or - sweep ordure, urine or leavings of food, or keeps him naked, beats him or abuses him or violates the ohastity of a female slave, he forfeits the price paid by him. He presoribes the first ammorcoment for a master having intercourse with a pledged slave girl against her will and middle ammorcement for a stranger doing so. 

Manu (VIII. 415 ) speaks of seven kinds of dāgas, viz. one captured in battle, one who becomes so for food ( i. e, in scarcity or in a famine), one born in the house ( i. e. of a female slave ), one bought, one given ( by his parents or relatives ), one inheri. ted ( as part of the patrimony), one who becomes so for paying off a fine or judicial decree. He states the general rule 428 that the wife, the son and the slave bave no wealth and whatever they earn belongs to him whose wife, son or slave they are. Manu prescribes a fine of 600 panas for a brāhmaṇa making a member of the dvijāti castes after his upanayana a slave against his will. 

Nārada (abhyupetyāsusrūṣa ) and Kātyāyana among the smrtikāras contain the most elaborate treatment on slavery, Nārada first says that & susrūṣaka (one who serves another ) is of five kinds viz. a Vedic student, an antavāgin (an apprentice who is learning a craft), adhikarmakst (a supervisor over workmen), bhṛtaka (hired servant) and dāsa. The first four are called karmakara. They can be called upon to do only work that is pure, while & dāse may have to do impure work *20 Buch as cleaning the entrances to the house, filthy pits (for leavings of food), the road, dunghill heaps, touching (or soratohing ) private parts, taking up and throwing away ordure and urine (verses 6-7), doing bodily service to the master if he so desires, Nārada mentions 15 kinds of slaves viz. one born in the house, one bought, one acquired (by gift or other means ),

one inherited, one saved in a time of famine, one pledged by the master, one discharged from a large debt, one cap. tured in a battle, one vanquished in a bet, one who &ocepts slavery by saying 'I am yours', an apostate from the order of asceticism, one who stipulates to be a slave (for & certain time ), one who is a slave for food ( as long as food is given to him), one who is tempted to become a slave out of love for a female slave, and one who sells himself. Nārada says that the first four of these are not freed from slavery except by the favour of the master( v. 29 ), while one who sells himself is the worst kind of slave and he also does not become free from slavery (v. 37). Nārada ( v. 30) and Yāj. (II. 182 ) state a rule applicable to all slaves, viz. that when a slave saves a master from imminent danger to the latter's life the slave becomes a free man and (Nārada adds ) that he gets & share in the inheritance as a son. One who is an apostate from the order of ascetics is a slavs of the king till the former's death ( Yaj. II. 183). One saved in a famine becomes free by giving a pair of cows, one pledgedo?! if the master who pledged him repays the debt, the slave in lieu of discharge of debt by paying off the debt with interest, one who accepted slavery or who was captured in battle or became so under a bet is freed by giving a substitute who is equal to him in work, one for a stipulated period by the lapse of the period, one who is a bhakta-dāsa becomes free by the master ceasing to give food, one who is 'vadavābśta ' ( tempted by a female slave ) by abandoning his intercourse with her ( Nārada vy. 31-34, 36 ). Yaj. ( II. 182 ) and Nārada (V. 38 ) say that one who was made a slave by force or was carried away by raiders and sold should be set free by the king. Yāj. (II. 183 ) and Nārada ( . 39) prescribe that a man can be a slave to a master only in the proper order of varṇas*** i. e, the three vargas next to a brāhmaṇa may be slaves to a brāhmaṇa, a vaisya or & sūdra may be a slave to a kṣatriya but a kṣatriya cannot be the slave of a vaiśya or a śūdra, nor a vaisya of a śūdra. There is one exoeption viz. an apostate from asoeticism muy be the slave of a vajśya or a sūdra 

431. A slave who is pledged becomes the slave of two till the pledge is redeemed.

king. Katyāyana emphasizes that a brāhmaṇa188 cannot be made a slave even to a brāhmaṇa, but if he himself chooses, he may do pure work for a brāhmaṇa endowed with character and Vodic learning, but no impure work. Katyāyana ( v. 721 ) says that when a brāhmaṇa becomes an apostate from the order of asceticism he should be banished from the kingdom and the kṣatriya or vaisya apostate may become a slave to the king. Dakṣa (VII. 33 ) quoted by Aparārka (p. 787) adds that the apostate's head should be branded with the mark of dog's foot. 

Kautilya 84 and Katyāyana (v. 723 ) both declare that if a master has sexual intercourse with a female slave and she is delivered of a child, both the slave and the child should be given freedom by the master. 

Kautilya declared that the heirs to the wealth of a slave are his relatives and if none of them exist then the master, while Katyāyana*85 says that the only wealth that the slave can call his own is the price he received for selling himself or what the master gave as a gift through favour. 

Nārada (vv. 42-43 ) describes the ceremony of the manu mission of a slave "when a master being pleased with a slave desires to make him & free man, he should take, from the slave's shoulder, a jar full of water and break it, he should sprinkle water mixed with whole grains of rice and flowers on the slave's head and thrice uttering the words 'you are no longer a slave' he should dismiss him with the ( slave's ) face to the east." 

The Vyavahāramayūkhu *38 quotes a verse from the Kalikāpurana about an adopted son, which is very interesting 

• persons adopted and the like on whom the samskārag of cūda ( tonsure ) and Upanayans are performed by the gotra of the adopter, become sons of ( the adopter ), otherwise the person on whom such ceremonies are not performed ) is held to be a slave

( of the adopter ).' The Vyavahāramayūkha remarks that this pagsage is not reliable as it is not found in several msø, of the Kalikapurāṇa. Narada mentions 15 kinds of slaves, but this is not one of them. All that the Kalikāpurāpa probably means is that when a boy is adopted into another family after his oūda and upanayana are performed in the family of birth, he is not fully affiliated in the family of adoption, he does not become a son and so does not take the inheritance but is only entitled to maintenance in the family of adoption, just as a slave is to be fed. No digests have recognised such a person as a slave proper. 

Nārada 37 (ṣṇādāna 12 ) and Katyāyana declare that a debt contracted by a Vedic pupil, an apprentice, a slave, the wife, a menial gervant and a workman for the benefit of the family even though it was inourred in his absenoe, was bind. ing on the owner of the house. Ordinarily a slave was not & competent witness, but Manu VIII. 70 and Uśanas ( quoted in Vyavahāramayūkha p. 37 ) say that when no other witness is available, a minor, an old man, a woman, a pupil, a relative, a slave or a hired servant may be a witness. 

There are numerous works dealing with slavery in its various aspects. The latest book on the subject is 'Slavery through the ages' by Sir George Mao Munn (1939). Mr. D, R. Banaji has published a very painstaking and interesting study on 'Slavery in British India' from 1772 to 1843 (2nd ed. 1937) The Carnegie Institution of Washington has published studies on several aspects such as ' Judicial Cases' (by Mrs. Catterall in 1926 ) and 'Doouments of the history of the Slave Trade to America, 1930' by Prof. Elizabeth Donnan. Dr. H. J. Nieboer's * Slavery as an Industrial System' (1910) is a well documented study of slavery in various countries and at various times.
