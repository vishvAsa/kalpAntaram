**(verses 11.1-2)**

The two verses together form one sentence; which lays down the several
characteristics of the person seeking for gifts; the sense being that
gifts shall be given, in proportion to their learning, to such penniless
men as, having the said character of ‘seeking for progeny’ and the rest,
may be seeking for gifts.

The term ‘*religious mendicant*,’ while qualifying the recipient of
gifts, serves also as a condition that entitles the man to receive
gifts. Thus it is that by laying down the character of the man fit for
receiving gifts, the Author also indicates the occasions on which gifts
may be given.

‘*One seeking for progeny*,’—h e who intends to marry for the purpose of
obtaining children. It is for the marriage that money is required; and
it helps in the obtaining of children indirectly. Inasmuch as the text
has added the epithet ‘religious,’ one need not give gifts to one who is
going to marry a second time, only through lust.

Similarly, ‘*one who is going to perform, a sacrifice*’ is to be
understood as referring to one who is seeking for wealth in order to
enable him to perform the *Agnihotra* and other compulsory rites.

The ‘*traveller on the road*,’—the person whose supply has run short
during his journey.

‘*Who has given away all his belongings*’;—*i.e*., the man who has given
away his entire property, as the sacrificial fee for the Viśvajit
sacrifice,—and not by way of an expiatory rite.

‘*He who is begging for study*’;—though for the *Religious Student*, all
that is laid down is ‘Vedic Study’ and ‘living on alms,’—yet enough
should be given to him to provide for his clothing. Or, even one who has
learnt the Veda may be seeking for the knowledge of what is contained in
the Veda, though he may be living on alms.

‘*Sick man*’—one suffering from a disease.

The name ‘*Snātaka*’ has been mentioned here only with a view to
eulogising the men spoken of. And the reason for applying this name lies
in the fact that as a rule ‘begging for the preceptor’ and ‘begging for
study’ are possible only for the *Snātaka*, the Accomplished Student;
though for the Religious Student also it has been laid down that he
shall do the begging for his preceptor.

‘*Penniless*’—destitute of wealth.

‘*In proportion to their learning*;’—*i.e*., much wealth shall be given
to one possessed of much learning, and little to one possessed of little
learning.

“All this that is stated here appears to be wholly irrelevant; as what
the Author has declared is—‘I am now going to expound the law relating
to Expiations’ (10.131).”

There is no force in this objection. In fact the whole context deals
with the duties of men in the various stages of life. The several
Expiatory Bites are of unequal nature, and hence these are mentioned
along with those. And what is stated in the opening verse has been
mentioned first, because it also indicates certain occasions for the
performance of expiatory rites.

It bus been said that ‘gifts shall be given’; and the act of ‘giving’
can be accomplished only through something that may be given; hence the
Author proceeds, in the next verso, to point, out what it is that should
be given.—(1-2)

**(verses 11.1-2)**

‘*Gurvartham*’.—‘For the purpose of maintaining his Teacher’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘in order to procure the fee
for his Teacher’ (Nārāyaṇa).

These verses are quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 468), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Sāntānika*,’ ‘for the sake of
offspring’;—‘*Sarvavedasa*’, ‘one who has given away all his
belongings’;—‘*upatāpī*’, one who is ill;—this is meant to permit only
that much of wandering on the road and other deviations without which
alms cannot be obtained.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 77);—and in *Parā* *śaramādhava* (Ācāra
p. 429), which adds the following notes:—‘*Sāntānika*,’ one who seeks
wealth for the purpose of marrying with a view to obtaining
children;—‘*Sarvavedasa*,’ one who has been reduced to penury on having
performed the sacrifice at which all his belongings have been given away
as the sacrificial fee,—‘*pitṛmātrartham*’, one who seeks to serve his
parents,—‘*svādhyāyārthī*,’ who seeks wealth for the keeping up of the
teaching of the Veda,—‘*upotāpī*’, invalid;—the compound
‘*svādhyāyārthyupatāpi*’ is to be expounded as ‘the *upatāpi*, invalid,
as along with the *svādhyāyārthi*’, *i.e*., both of these.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha p. 354, and Dāna p. 30), which
explains ‘*sāntānikān*’ as ‘those who seek to marry for the purpose of
begetting offspring’,—‘*adhvaga*’ as ‘one who has started on a
pilgrimage’,—‘*sārvavedasa*,’ (which is its reading for ‘*sarvavedasa*’)
as ‘one who is performing sacrifice at which one’s entire property is
given away as the sacrificial fee,’—and ‘*upatāpi*’ as an ‘invalid.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

**(verses 11.1-3)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.1-3).—‘One whose property has been stolen, one who
is going to perform a sacrifice, one who has read up to the end of all
the Vedas, one who is seeking wealth for his teacher, or for the
performance of rites to Pitṛs, or for the carrying on of Vedic
study,—such Brāhmaṇas have been regarded as righteous beggars. To such
poor men one should give gifts and also impart learning. In other cases
the sacrificial fee should be paid; and to others, cooked food may he
given outside the altar.’

*Gautama* (5.21-23).—‘Presents of money should be given, outside the
Vedi, to persons begging for their teachers, or in order to defray the
expenses of their wedding, or to procure medicine for the sick, to those
who are going to offer a sacrifice, to those engaged in study, to
travellers, and to those who have performed the Viśvajit sacrifice.
Prepared food should be given to other beggars.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.5.19-20).—‘Presents of money should be given, according
to one’s ability, to good Brāhmaṇas, *Śrotriyas*, and to those who have
gone to the end of the Vedas, when they beg outside the Vedi, for the
sake of their teachers, or for defraying the expenses of their marriage,
or of medicine, or when they are distressed for livelihood, or are
desirous of offering a sacrifice, or engaged in study, or on a journey,
or have performed the *Viśvajit* sacrifice. Cooked food should be given
to other beggars.’

*Āpastamba* (2.10.1-2).—‘The reasons for which begging is permissible
are—tho desire to collect the fee for the teacher, the celebration of
wedding, or of a *Śrauta* sacrifice, the desire to maintain one’s
parents and the impending interruption of ceremonies performed by a
worthy man. The person asked for alms must examine the qualities of the
petitioner and give according to his power.’

Though the term ‘*dakṣiṇā*’ primarily denotes the fee that is given to a
man for doing some work, yet, here it stands for all those things that
are given away, with the exception of cows, lands and golden vessels.
Such too is the ordinary use of the term.

‘*For others*’—for supplicants other than those mentioned here.

‘*Cooked food*’—To such men cooked food shall be given for eating.

‘*Outside the sacrificial enclosure*’—his refers to the food that should
be given by householders, apart from that which is given in connection
with sacrificial performances.—(3)

According to Kullūka, the meaning is that ‘to these most excellent
Brāhmaṇas food together with presents must be given inside the
sacrificial enclosure’;—according to *Nārāyaṇa*, ‘the nine mendicants
mentioned in verses 1 and 2 shall always receive what they ask for, and
other mendicants ordinary food only, but that if they beg at the
performance of a sacrifice, other property also must be given to them’.

If a man possesses food sufficient for the maintenance of those whom he has to support, for three years, or more, he deserves to drink soma.—(6)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If a man has enough wealth to enable him to maintain his dependants for
three years,—or if he possesses more—he is worthy of drinking
Soma-juice.

Inasmuch as the performance of the Soma-sacrifice has been prescribed by
the *Śruti* as a compulsory act to be done daily, the present verse
cannot be accepted as applicable to even that case where the man’s
dependants are in want; since Śruti is the highest authority in these
matters. The present prohibition should therefore be taken as meant to
apply to such Soma-sacrifices as may be purely voluntary.

“In connection with the Soma-sacrifice, much wealth is needed for the
purchase of the Soma and the hiring of the services of the priests, for
whom ‘twelve thousand’ has been prescribed as the sacrificial fee. Thus
then, since much larger wealth would be necessary for the performance,
how is it that the text speaks of what is just enough for the
maintenance of the man’s dependants *for three years*?”

As a matter of fact, when a man possesses much wealth, he does fulfil
the condition of possessing enough to maintain his dependants for three
years; so that it would be open to the man possessed of much wealth to
perform the sacrifice.

Though as a rule the term ‘*dāna*,’ ‘*gift*,’ is used in the sense of
*gift of food*, yet people might be led to make gifts of gold also, for
the purpose of enabling the recipient to purchase the Soma and perform
the Soma-sacrifice. And it is such gifts that the next verse is intended
to forbid. \[The penniless man shall not perform the voluntary
Soma-sacrifices\].—(6)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 165);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra p. 157), to the effect that the Soma-sacrifice is to be performed
only by one who is rich enough for the purpose.,

**(verses 11.6-7)

*Mahābhārata* (12. 165. 5).—(Same as Manu 7.)

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8. 10).—‘He who possesses wealth sufficient for the expenses
of a Soma-sacrifice shall not abstain from offering that sacrifice.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.8-10).—‘He who has sufficient supply of food for three years
shall perform the Soma-sacrifice;—he shall perform the Soma-sacrifice
once a year during the Spring.—If he has less than that, he shall
perform the *Vaiśvānarī* sacrifice.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.124).—‘The twice-born man who has a supply of food
which is more than what he shall need for three years, should perform
the Soma-sacrifice;—and one who has food enough for one year should
perform the rites preliminary to the Soma-sacrifice.’

This verse reiterates the logical fact that no benefit is obtained by a
man who has lost his title to the performance by transgressing a
definite prohibition.

Inasmuch as the text speaks of ‘*reward*,’ it is dear that what is here
stated pertains to voluntary performances.

‘*Even though he may have drunk Soma formerly*’—This implies that a
previous performance of the Soma-sacrifice is absolutely compulsory.

The latter half is purely declamatory; it should not be taken as
precluding the man who has *not* drunk the Soma formerly.—(7)

‘*His own people*’—Servants, councillors, mother, son, wife and so
forth;—while these ‘*are living in distress*,’—if the man ‘*gives to
other people*’—for the purpose of acquiring fame,—this form would be
like ‘*swallowing poison*,’—‘*which is sweet in the beginning*.’ The
swallowing of poison, though apparently sweet in the beginning, leads to
disastrous results, in the shape of death; exactly like that is the
giving of gifts just described.

This same idea is otherwise expressed by calling the act ‘*counterfeit
virtue*.’ It has the semblance of virtue and is not real virtue; just as
the shell is *like silver*, not silver itself.—(8)

*Śātātapa* (Aparārka, p. 283).—‘The twice-born person who, in feeding
and making gifts, passes over the student near at hand destroys his
family to the seventh generation.’

*Bhaviṣyapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘If one passes over the Brāhmaṇa near at
hand,—except when he is an outcast,—and feeds one at a distance, he
falls into hell.—For this reason, the wise man should never pass over
his neighbours and relations, or his daughter’s son or sister’s husband,
or his sister’s son specially, and other relations; he should not pass
over these even if they be illiterate; passing over them, one falls into
hell.’

*Vyāsa* (Do., p. 282).—‘What is given to one’s parents, brothers,
sisters or daughters, wife or sons,—becomes an irreproachable bridge to
heaven. A gift made to the father becomes a hundredfold, that to the
mother a thousandfold, that to the daughter becomes endless, and what is
given to the uterine brother is imperishable.’

*Dakṣa* (Do., p. 939).—‘The following are the persons that should be
supported by rich persons:—father, mother, teacher, wife, children, a
poor man seeking shelter, guest and fire; also relations that are poor,
an orphan seeking shelter. He shall make presents to learned
men......... The supporting of one’s dependants is the way to heaven,
and the harassing of them is the way to hell.’

**(verses 11.11-12)**

Inasmuch as the text speaks of the *requisite*, it follows that the
appropriation here permitted applies, not only to the gold necessary for
the making up of the sacrificial fee, but also to animals and other
things necessary for the sacrifice. All that the text lays down is the
*appropriation* of the thing, and not the mode by which it should be
done. Hence the thing may he acquired either by begging, or by exchange
or by stealing.

“But it has been said that ownership is not acquired by stealing.”

There is no force in this objection. Since it is directly laid down
here, in so many words, that the thing shall be ‘*appropriated*’; and it
has also been said that ‘a sacrifice may be accomplished even by doing a
mean act.’

There is nothing to show whether this ‘appropriation’ is permitted only
in a case where a sacrifice having been begun, all its requisites are at
hand, with the exception of a single article,—or also when it is
intended to be taken in hand.

‘*Specially of a Brāhmaṇa*’—This shows that for the Kṣatriya and the
Vaiśya also the said appropriation under the said circumstance is
permitted.

“What Kṣatriya is there who would *beg?* Specially as begging is
absolutely impossible for the Kṣatriya.”

What you say is not enough. For the Brāhmaṇa also, *stealing* is
forbidden. The fact of the matter is that there is no restriction
regarding the method to be employed in the appropriation under the said
circumstances.

^(‘)*During the reign of a righteous king*’— This is purely reiterative.
If the king is righteous and knows the law, he would know that under
tin; peculiar circumstances *stealing* is permitted, and hence the
sacrificer would he emboldened to do the appropriation. If, on the other
hand, the king did not know the law, he would punish the said
appropriation like ordinary *theft*; and hence under his rule no one
would think of doing it.

‘*Possessing many cattle*’—This stands for all kinds of wealth.

‘*Who does not perform sacrifices*’—*i.e*., who does not do any
righteous act, in the shape of giving gifts and so forth.

‘*Kuṭumba*’ stands here for the *house*. It is stealing from the house
that is exceptionally objectionable; hence it is this that is permitted.
But no such restriction is meant as that it should be taken ‘*from* *the
house*’ only; it may be taken also from the threshing yard and such
other places, where the particular thing may be available; specially as
it is going to be declared later on (Verse 17)—‘either from the
threshing yard, or from the field, or from the house.’—(11-12)

According to Nārāyaṇa and Nandana, ‘the king’ is the agent to be

a parallel passage in the Mahābhārata which ends with

If the thing required is not available in the house of a Vaiśya, it may
be taken from that of a Śūdra.

‘*Two or three*.’—These must be taken as referring to sacrificial
requisites, since it is these that the text is dealing with.

The text adds a declamatory statement—‘*The Śūdra has nothing to do with
sacrifices*

Though the appropriation has been spoken of above as to be done by
several methods, vet in the ease of the *Śūdra*, there should be no
*begging*, since it is distinctly said that—‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not beg
wealth, for the purpose of sacrifices, from a Śūdra.’—(24)

“In another Smṛti, the performance of sacrifices with wealth belonging
to the Śūdra has been prohibited without any exceptions.”

On the strength of the present text itself, it follows that one may
accept gifts from the Śūdra.

Others however explain that when the wealth has been appropriated by the
Brāhmaṇa, it is no longer ‘wealth belonging to the Śūdra.’

As a matter of fact, however, what the prohibition refers to is the
doing of ‘*Śānti*’ and ‘*Pauṣṭika*’ rites for the Śūdra. And a
performance is actually called after that wealth which the *Ṛtvik*
priest actually employs in the performance; and there is no doubt that
in the case of the sacrifices in question, the performance would be
styled as done with wealth belonging to the *Śūdra*,’ in view of the
fact that the wealth originally belonged to him, even though it may not
do so at the time of the performance itself.—(13)

**(verses 11.16-17)**

The property of another person may he seized also when one’s own family
is suffering from want

‘*Not lasting till the morrow*.’—The addition of this phrase implies
that the taking of only that much is permitted which may maintain the
family for one day,—and no more.

‘*From one whose sacred duties are neglected*’—implies that it may be
taken for the purpose of sacred rites.

Another *Smṛti* says—‘At first one should appropriate from a person of
lower status than himself; if no such be available, then from a man of
equal status; and in the event of this also being not available, even
from a person of superior righteousness.’

‘*For the seventh meal*.’—If the man has not eaten for three days he may
appropriate another’s property for his morning meal on the fourth day.
Two meals a day have been laid down in such texts as—‘one shall eat in
the morning and in the evening.’

‘*Or from any place*.’—Even out of the garden and such places.

‘*He should confess it*’—but ‘*to the questioner*’ *only*;—‘*if he
questions him*,’—*i.e*., he should not send for him and force the owner
to question him.

Or the ‘*questioner*’ may stand for the owner of the property, and ‘*if
he questions him*’ for the king; the king questioning him when he is
taken before him (and charged with having taken away the property). In
this manner we may distinguish between the two terms ‘*pṛcchate*’ and
‘*pṛcchati*.’ Says Gautama (18. 30)—‘Questioned by the king he should
confess it’

What is said here should be understood to apply to both cases—*want of
food*, and shortage of sacrificial requisites.—(16-17)

**(verse 11.16)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 275), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Bhakta*’ is food; ‘*saptame bhakte*,’ on the
fourth day;—‘*aśvastanavidhānena*,’ in such a way that there may be
nothing left over for the second day;—‘*hīnakarmaṇaḥ*,’ from a man whose
religious acts are very poor.—It is quoted again under (2.43), whíere
the meaning is explained as that ‘if, in the absence of food, a man has
gone without food for three days, he should wrest from a man deficient
in religious acts just enough for one day.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 938), which explains the meaning as—‘if a
man has gone without food for six meals, then at the time of his seventh
meal, he should take by force just enough for the day from a man of
lower caste and also from one who is deficient in religious acts.’

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 352), to the effect that if a man
has gone without six meals, he may steal food; and notes that this
sanction implies that one may even perform the Vaiśvadeva rites with
such stolen food.

**(verse 11.17)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.43), to the effect that if, under
circumstances mentioned in the preceding verse, one has stolen food, he
should confess if asked;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 938), to the effect that
the food spoken of in the preceding verse, may be taken from the
threshing-yard and other places.

It is *begging* that is forbidden here; if anything comes *unasked*, the
acceptance of that is not forbidden; since it has been declared
that—‘the acceptance of riches that come unasked is declared to be no
*acceptance* at all, in accordance with special usage and texts.’

This prohibition is with reference to the begging of wealth for
sacrificial purposes, and not to that for maintaining one’s dependants.

Some people regard this verse only as supplementary to what has gone
before; the meaning being that—‘inasmuch as begging is found to be beset
with an undesirable feature, the appropriation of the property of Śūdras
should be done in other ways.’—(24)

‘*Property o* *f* *the gods*’ is the name given to all that belongs to
such men of the three higher castes as are disposed to perform
sacrifices. ‘*Property of the Brāhmaṇa*’ is the name that is applied to
the belongings of even such Brāhmaṇas as are not disposed to perform
sacrifices.

It is in this sense that the verse may be construed:

As a matter of fact however Verse 20 above, which says—The property of
those disposed to perform sacrifices the wise call the ‘*property of the
gods, etc*.’—is purely declamatory, and not meant to provide the
definition of technical terms; like such terms as ‘theft’ and the like.
For this reason we proceed to explain it differently.

That wealth which has been set apart as to be spent for the gods, in the
performance of sacrifices and other such acts, is ‘*the property of the
gods*’; as direct *ownership* is not possible for the gods. In fact the
gods never make use of any property, by their own wish; nor are they
found to be actually taking care of any property; and it is where all
this is found that property is said in ordinary life to *belong* to a
person. Hence the name ‘*property of the gods*’ must apply to that which
has been set apart as to be used on behalf of the gods,—with such
formula as ‘this is no longer mine, it is the god’s.’ And this can refer
to only what has been enjoined as to be offered to Agni and other
deities at the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices; and it is merely
on the basis of the custom of cultured people that it can be applied,
only figuratively, to what is offered at sacrifices to Durgā and other
deities (which latter are not enjoined in the Veda).

“In the ordinary world, it is property dedicated to the four-armed and
other images in temples that is called ‘the property of the gods;’ and
it is only right that in the interpretation of scriptures we should
accept that meaning of a word in which it is used in ordinary parlance.”

This would be so, if the term ‘*devasvam*,’ ‘property of the gods,’ were
recognised as a non-composite, word (whose denotation is not affected by
that of its component parts). As a matter of fact, however, the term
‘*devasvam*’ is composite, and its best denotation therefore is that
which is provided by its component parts (‘*deva*,’ ‘gods,’ and
‘*svam*,’ ‘property’); and there is no authority for the assuming of any
other denotation. That the true deific character does not belong to the
four-armed image is shown by the simple fact that it is regarded as an
‘*image*’ (and not as the *reality*)’, nor is there any definition of
‘god’ which can apply directly to the image. According to usage, the
property of such images may be called ‘property of the gods.’ But even
there, there can be no *ownership*. And yet actual business may be
carried on in accordance with the explanation given above. All this has
been explained in Discourse II (Verse 189).—(26)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The actual form of Vaiśvānarī sacrifice should be learnt from the
*Gṛhyasūtras*.

‘*Change of year*’—when one year ends and another begins.

‘*Prescribed*’—enjoined.

‘*Animal and Soma sacrifices*’—the compulsory ones. The six-monthly and
yearly ‘Animal sacrifices’ are compulsory, as also the ‘Soma sacrifice’
every spring.

‘*In the event of the impossibility of the performance*’—of these, on
account of the absence of the requisite wealth;—‘*in* *expiation
thereof*.’—for the removal of the sin incurred by the omission of a
compulsory rite.

In connection with the occasion here referred to, the Veda lays down
other expiatory rites; and some people would combine these with what is
here prescribed; their point being that, even though both the rites
serve the same purpose, yet they are found to be laid down by two
distinct authorities.

This however is not right; because in connection with the expiatory
rites for the slaying of a Brāhmaṇa, our Author is going to declare, in
so many words, that between the rite laid down in the *Veda* and that
prescribed in the *Smṛti*, there should be *option*:—‘He may perform the
Abhijit or the Viśvajit’ (11.75).—(27)

What the verse means is that when the occasion for it arises there is
nothing wrong in the Brāhmaṇa having recourse to malevolent rites; it
does not actually enjoin these rites; nor does it actually forbid the
act of complaining to the King; all that is meant is that if there has
been occasion for it, and the Brāhmaṇa does have recourse to the
malevolent rites, the King shall not interfere with him. This is what is
going to be declared later on: ‘The Brāhmaṇa is the creator, the
punisher, etc, etc.—hence no one should say anything unpleasant to him’
(Verse 35),—where it is understood that the King shall not tell him
anything.

‘*Shall punish* ’— Though there is this injunction, yet, as a rule, the
Brāhmaṇa should complain to the King; because the sentence ‘*he* *shall
not complain to the* *King*’ is not a prohibition, as is clear from the
consideration of the concluding verse.

The occasions referred to here have been already enumerated—‘If one
molests his wife’ and so forth. In the case of slight offences, he shall
complain to the King—‘this man has done this to me.’

‘*Conversant with the Law*’—*i.e*., knowing the procedure of the
malevolent rites.

‘*By* *his own power*’—by means of incantations and curses; that these
are meant being clearly indicated by the next verse.—(31)

This verse is for the purpose of removing doubts as to what constitutes
the ‘power’ of the Brāhmaṇa.

‘*Śruti*’ is what is *heard*. The meaning is that he should employ those
malevolent rites that are found revealed in the Atharva-Veda. This
particular Veda has been mentioned because it abounds in injunctions of
malevolent spells,—which also are not such as have been actually
forbidden by the other Vedas.

Or, the term ‘*atharvāṅgirasī*’ may be taken as standing for all those
sacred texts that deal with malevolent rites.

Or, the term ‘*Atharva*’ itself may be taken as standing for the rites
themselves; as we find it used in such passages.as—‘the *Atharvana* is
the name of that sacrifice which is performed with a view to a definite
desirable result.’—(33)

The meaning of this verse has been already explained before.

When a Brāhmaṇa is performing a malevolent rite, the King shall not
utter any such ‘*unpleasant words*’ as ‘punish him.’

‘*He shall not we harsh words*.’—This prohibition refers also to
remonstrance and censure.

Or, the meaning may be that—‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not be ill-treated by
men of any caste; since he is very powerful, by reason of his knowledge
of the Vedas, and is capable of inflicting punishments by himself.’

‘*Creator*’—of another King.

‘*Punisher*’—chastiser.

‘*Advisor*’—one who offers beneficial advice.

And since he is all this, he is a ‘*benefactor*.’

Thus, being endowed with all kinds of power, he should not be
disregarded as a weakling.—(35)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

In connection with the appointing of the priests at the *Agnihotra* it
has been said,—‘one shall pour the libations or have it poured;’ and as
these words are applicable equally to the man and the woman, as being
entitled to the pouring of milk-offerings, the present text forbids it
in regard to girls and youthful women.

Similarly the possibility of such offerings being made by one who is
possessed of ‘*little learning*’—*i.e*., knows only the texts bearing on
the two oblations,—or by ‘*a fool*.’

‘*Distressed*’—by illness.

‘*Without sacraments*’—who has not been initiated.

Some people hold that this explanation of the text is not right. As
regards the *Śrauta* Agnihotra, the declaration is—‘on each *Parva day*
one shall pour the libations himself, or one of the priests shall do
it;’ there is no possibility for a woman ever acting as a ‘priest’;
hence the prohibition herein contained must pertain to ‘the girl and the
youthful woman,’—its purpose being to indicate the possibility of its
being done by a woman who has got a son. In support of this they quote
the following words of other Sūtra-writers—‘The wife may freely pour the
morning and evening libations in the domestic fire.’ Others again, on
the strength of what is said (in the next verse) regarding one being
‘skilled in the rituals,’ hold that the prohibition pertains to the
Three Fires (of the Śrauta ritual).

But as a matter of fact the term ‘*vitāna*’ (used in the next verse)
stands for ‘ritual’; and all this is performed only in *Śrauta* fires;
so that there is no possibility of either *women* or *unlearned* men.
performing these; specially as it has been laid down that only very
specially qualified persons should act as priests.

From all this it is clear that the term ‘*Agnihotra*’ here stands for
all kinds of rites, and the term ‘*hotṛ*’ for all classes of priests. So
that the present *Smṛti* is only a reiteration of what has been enjoined
in the Veda.—(36)

A sacrifice is regarded as ‘*with small fees*’ when the fee given at it
is smaller than what has been prescribed.

“The fee is a sort of *hire*; if a worker is obtained at a lower hire,
why should anything higher be paid? This is the principle that governs
all dealings of people in the ordinary world, with the ploughman and
other workers. There is the saying also—‘when a thing can be had for one
*paṇa*, what wise men shall buy it for ten paṇas?’ If the sacred texts
prescribe ‘twelve-hundred’ as the fee, this is done only with a view to
the obtaining of higher rewards.”

It is people entertaining such notions for whose sake the present text
sets forth the prohibition, and it does not refer to a case where the
prescribed fee itself is *small*.—(39)

‘*Neglects*’—omits to tend; this may mean either the absolute omission
of the rite, or allowing the fires to be extinguished.

The text lays down the Expiatory Rite here, because the text has been
dealing with the Agnihotra.

Inasmuch as the text speaks of ‘*fires*’ (in the plural), what is here
said may also he assumed to be applicable to the neglect of the
‘domestic fire.’

‘*Equal* to *the killing of a hero*’—in view of the declaration,—‘he who
allows the fires to become extinguished is regarded by the gods as the
*slayer of a hero*.’

The addition of the qualifying team ‘*wilfully*’ indicates that when the
neglect is *not wilful*, there should be some other form of
expiation.—(41)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Vīra*’—‘Son’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘a
Kṣatriya’ (Nandana);—‘a deity’ (suggested by Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1154), which adds the following
notes:—The construction is ‘*māsamagnīn apavidhya*’;—‘*vīra*’ is the
sacrificer;—if the omission lasts longer than a month, the man should
perform the ‘Three monthly Goghna expiation’;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* II
(p. 115);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 425);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 391), which explains ‘*apavidhya*’ as
‘abandoning’,—‘*vīrahatyā*’ as ‘murdering the sacrificer’.

*Gautama* (22.34).—‘The penance of abstaining from sexual intercourse
for one year shall be performed by him who extinguishes the sacred
fires, who neglects the daily recitation of the Veda or who has been
guilty of a minor offence.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.18).—‘One who extinguishes the sacred fires, or who
forgets the Veda through neglect of the daily recitation, is a sinful
man.’

Do. (21-27).—‘He who extinguishes the sacred fires shall perform the
*Kṛcchra* penance of twelve days, and shall cause them to he kindled
again.’

*Viṣṇu* (54-13).—‘One who forgets the Vedic texts be has studied, or who
forsakes the sacred fires, must subsist on alms for one year, bathing
three times, sleeping on the ground and eating only one meal a day.’

*Hārīta* (Aparārka, p. 1154).—‘If the sacred fires have remained
extinguished for a year, one should perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance and
kindle them again; if for two years, he should perforin the *Somāyana*

People explain this verse to mean that the Agnihotra should not be
performed with the wealth obtained from Śūdras, as a friendly present.
The prohibition does not apply to the carrying on of such compulsory
rites as have been already undertaken. It has been declared that ‘one
should not perform sacrifices after having begged wealth from Śūdras,
there is no harm, however, if the wealth is given *unasked*, and is used
for the carrying on of a rite already commenced.’ Further it is only
*making* a *living* by receiving gifts from improper persons that has
been forbidden; while the performance of the compulsory rites by such
means has been permitted. From all this the present verse is understood
to be the prohibition of only the single rite of ‘Fire-laying’;
specially because the text mentions simply ‘the wealth of the Śūdra,’
and does not make any such distinction as between what is obtained *by
begging* and what is obtained *unasked*. If the prohibition pertained to
*all rites*, then, since the prohibition would have been secured by the
present verse, there would be no point in the prohibition of ‘begging’
contained in Verse 24.—(42)

The text now proceeds to describe those Expiatory Rites which form the
subject-matter of the discourse, and first of all it describes the
persons liable to the performance of these rites. What is it that makes
a man liable?

‘*What is enjoined*’—as a compulsory act, such as the Twilight Prayers,
the Agnihotra and so forth, all such as have their compulsory character
indicated by such words as ‘one shall perform the Agnihotra *throughout
life*.’ Those acts also that have been laid down as to be done under
specified circumstances,—such as bathing when one is defiled by the
touch of something unclean—are included among those ‘*enjoined*.’

‘*Does* *not do*’—through carelessness or laziness.

Similarly ‘*what is censured*’—forbidden, such as the drinking of wine
and so forth. If one, transgressing the Scriptures, has recourse to such
acts.

‘*Becomes liable to expiatory rites*.’—All this means that the liability
in this case is conditional; the performance of expiatory rites being
incumbent upon one who omits what is enjoined and does what is
forbidden.

“For one who is desirous of acquiring a village the *Sāṅgra* *haṇī*
sacrifice has been *enjoined*; so that if one who is desirous of
acquiring a village is somehow unable to perform that sacrifice, this
would be an *omission of what is enjoined* on his part; as soon as he
conceives a desire for the acquisition of a village, the said sacrifice
becomes for him an ‘enjoined act’; so that if he does not undertake it,
he transgresses the injunction and hence should be liable to the
expiatory rites.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—What the injunction in such a
case means is that ‘when one undertakes the performance of the
particular sacrifice, he is led to it by a desire for the reward in the
shape of a village’; so that what the scriptural injunction really does
is to indicate the relation of cause and effect between the ‘sacrifice’
and the ‘acquisition of a village.’ Even though in this case also the
main idea expressed by the injunctive sentence is that the act in
question *should be done*, yet what the injunction actually does is to
lay down that the act should be done only for the accomplishment of the
said purpose. So that all that happens to the person omitting the
performance of that sacrifice is that that purpose is not accomplished;
such omission does not involve a sin; and an expiatory rite would be
necessary only when there has been some sin.

“Whence is the idea derived that the omission of a compulsory duty
involves sin? In connection with the Agnihotra and such other compulsory
acts, we do not find any such assertion as—‘he who does not do it incurs
sin.’”

As a matter of fact we do find sentences occurring in the wake of the
injunction of compulsory duties,—such as ‘*vedibh-yaḥ paramā bhavati*’
\[which are understood to be indicative of the said idea\]; and in
almost all cases there are declamatory passages indicative of the sin
involved in the omission of compulsory acts; and there must be some
truth in these; otherwise they could not be construed along with any
injunction. Even in cases where no such declamatory passages are
actually found, they are always assumed in support of injunctions. In
fact it is the declamatory passages that constitute the driving force
behind injunctions; such driving force would not be efficient unless it
were assumed that an omission would involve sin. In the actual practice
of all experienced men such is the operation of all Injunctions.
Injunction is as a rule known to *urge* people to actions;—men are never
*urged* to anything except what serves a useful purpose for them; and it
is with a view to guard against the contingency of the Injunction
becoming deprived of this *urging* force that we have to make the said
assumption (of passages declaring that omission involves sin). Though
the urging power could be secured also by assuming that the act
concerned leads to Heaven, yet, as such an idea would be inconsistent
with the conception that the act should be done *throughout life*, it
becomes necessary to conclude that the due performance saves one from
*sin*. To this end we have the assertion—‘even a hundred injunctions do
not secure that activity of men which is brought about by fear.’

From all this it is clear that when the text speaks of a man not doing
‘*what is enjoined*,’ it refers to the *compulsory acts*.

“In connection with bathing on touching an unclean thing, there are no
words indicating its compulsory character, like such expressions as
‘throughout life’ and the like.”

What is the need of any other words? What the text is understood to
indicate is that a certain act is to be done under certain specified
circumstances; and there is no need for any other driving agency. The
fact of the act being compulsory is expressed by the notion that
whenever the said circumstance presents itself, it should be done. In
the case of *Agnihotra* and such other rites also, we do not find the
texts actually containing the term ‘compulsory,’—the compulsory
character bring indicated only by the absolute certainty of the
condition mentioned (‘throughout life,’ in connection with the
Agnihotra).

‘*Addicted*’—Constantly using such sensual objects as richly cooked
food, sandal-paint and unguents, etc. This implies the character of
bring always given to such enjoyment.

“This has been already prohibited under 4.16, where it has been said
that—‘one shall not attach himself to sensual pleasures.’”

People think that since this latter passage occurs in connection with
the vows of the Accomplished Student, it cannot serve as a general
Prohibition. What occurs under ‘vows’ cannot be regarded as a
Prohibition; as what is enjoined under ‘vows’ is the taking of a certain
resolve, in some such form as—‘I shall not do such and such an act.’

Or, some one may be inclined to think that the former prohibition being
a slight one, the offence is not a serious one. With a view to guard
against this, the Author has put the offence on the same footing as
other serious offences.

Or, the explanation may be that it is often found that, even though
something has been forbidden in a general way, it is again forbidden
specifically, for the purpose of indicating its importance.

For instance, we often meet with such assertions as—‘The Brāhmaṇas have
come,—the *Vaśiṣṭhas* have also come.’

‘*Becomes liable to expiatory rites*’— The term ‘*prāyaścitta*,’
‘*expiatory rite*,’ is a conventional name applied to certain rites
performed under certain specified conditions, and the form
‘*prāyaścittīyate*’ is formed according to Pāṇini 3.1.85.

‘*Man*’— This term has been added for the purpose of indicating that
what is here stated applies to all the four castes.—(44)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.220), which notes that the use of
the general term ‘*naraḥ*’ implies that what is here said is applicable
to the ease of men born of reversed parentage; such general sins as
those of killing and the like being possible in their case also;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 50), which adds that the verse is indicative
of those sins that accrue from the omission, through sloth, of the
obligatory duties;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 6);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 10), which says that the meaning is that the act
is *sinful*, and hence involves expiation;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
351).

**(verses 11.44-47)**

*Mahābhārata* (12-34.2).—(Same as Manu 44)

*Gautama* (19.2-7).—‘A man in this world is polluted by a vile action,
such as sacrificing for men unworthy to offer sacrifices, eating
forbidden food, speaking what should not he spoken, neglecting what is
prescribed and doing what is forbidden. People are in doubt if such a
man shall, or shall not, perform a penance for such a deed. Some declare
that he shall not do it, because the deed must persist. The best opinion
is that he shall perform a penance. For it is declared in the Veda that
one who has performed the penance of *Punastoma* may come back to
partake of the Soma-libations.’

*Baudhāyana* (3.10.2-5).—\[The same as Gautama; but it adds ‘accepting
gifts from those whose gift should not be accepted;’ for ‘eats forbidden
food,’ it has ‘Eats the food of one whose food should not he eaten,’ and
it omits ‘speaking etc.’ and also ‘neglecting what is prescribed.’\]

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.1-2).—‘A penance shall be performed for an offence
committed unintentionally. Some declare that it shall he performed also
for those committed intentionally.’

Do. (22.1-5).—‘Now indeed man in this world speaks an untruth, or
sacrifices for men unworthy to offer a sacrifice, or accepts what should
not be accepted, or eats forbidden food, or does what should not be
done.’ (The rest as in Gautama).

*Yājñavalkya* (3.219-221).—‘A man becomes degraded by omitting to do
what is enjoined, by doing what is condemned, and by not controlling the
senses. Therefore for the purpose of purifying himself, he shall perform
expiatory penances; thus do the people and also his own inner soul
become appeased. By the performance of expiatory penances does that sin
disappear which had been committed unintentionally; if the sin had been
committed intentionally, the performance of the penances only makes the
man fit for being associated with; such being the declaration. Those who
commit sins, and yet do not perform the penances, nor repent their
misdeeds, fall into terrible hells.’

*Chāgaleya* (Aparārka, p. 1039).—‘The expiatory penances are for sins
committed unintentionally; for those committed intentionally, there is
no expiation.’

*Jābāli* (Parāśaramādhava-Prāyaścitta, p. 153).—‘The Brāhmaṇas prescribe
penances for sins committed unintentionally; some people prescribe them
also for those committed intentionally, for twice-born men as well as
for Śūdras.’

*Devala* (Do.).—‘When a sin has been committed unintentionally, and only
once, there is expiation prescribed for it by persons versed in the Law.
If the sin is committed a second time, the penance shall he the double
of the former; if it is repeated for the third time, it shall he the
three-fold *Kṛcchra*; and for the fourth repetition, there is no
expiation. Nor is there any expiation for a sin committed even once, if
it has been committed intentionally. But some people lay down expiation
even for sins committed intentionally.’

*Aṅgiras* (Do.).—‘If the sin has been committed unintentionally, penance
is performed; hut there is none for sins committed intentionally; even
if there be, it will have to be double of the former.’

This declaration has been made for the purpose of indicating that in
cases of intentional offence, the Expiatory Rite should be of a
particularly serious character.

‘*Committed unintentionally*.’—They declare that Expiatory Rites are
meant, to be performed in cases where the ‘*sin*’—the transgression of
the ordinances—has been committed through negligence or want of care.

“What are the grounds for such an opinion? The law on the point is
that—‘when a man transgresses an injunction and undertakes a wrong act,
he shall perform an expiatory rite.’ So that there is no ground for any
differentiation.”

Some people hold that if there were no such differentiation, there would
be no point in the prescribing of special Expiatory Ṛtes for cases of
intentional offence.

It is for this reason that the text puts forward another view, by way of
a ‘*Pūrvapakṣa*’ a ‘contrary view’—‘They apply to cases of *intentional
offence also*.’ According to this view the meaning of the Law would be
that Expiatory Rites shall be performed in cases of *intentional* as
well as *unintentional* offences.

‘*On the evidence of Śruti texts*’—One Vedic text indicative of the said
view is found in the *Upahavya-Brāhmaṇa* (the story of Upahavya)—‘Indra
gave away the ascetics to the dogs.’ Such giving away could never have
been *unintentional*; and yet the story goes on to say, it was for the
purpose of expiating this sin that Prajāpati made over Upahavya to
Indra. Such is the clear meaning of the text—(45)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Cf*. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.28.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 705), which quotes a Vedic
text to the effect that once Indra gave away certain sages to be
devoured by the ‘*Śālāvṛka*’ dogs, for which sinful act Prajāpati
ordained for him the expiatory rite called ‘Upahavya’, which is taken as
implying that for *intentional* offences also there is ‘expiation.’.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, (3.226), as indicating that expiatory rites
are to be performed in the case of intentional offences also,—and *not*
that the sin accruing from such offences is wiped off by these rites, in
the case of ‘degrading’ offences.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 152), to the effect
that in the case of intentional offences, there can be expiation, only
according to some authorities, not all;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p.
18), which says that stress is meant to the laid upon ‘*akāmakāḥ*’ as it
is only for *unintentional* delinquencies that there is expiation, and
in reference to ‘*Śrutividarśanāt*,’ it quotes the Śruti-passage
describing the story of Indra and the Śālavṛkas.

*Question*.—“Do these Expiatory Rites end only with their performance
(without bringing about any effects), just like the Twilight Prayers and
other rites? Or, do they continue until definite effects are produced,
in the form of the actual removal of the guilt like the act of cleansing
the body (which ends only with the actual removal of the dirt)?”

In answer to this some people offer the following explanation:—As a
matter of fact no action is ever lost; both merit and demerit (due to
actions) end only with the bringing about of their effects; no actions
ever disappear until they have brought about their effects. This is what
is meant by the assertion that ‘no action is ever lost’ Hence the man
who commits a transgression *must* experience the tortures of hell, as
the result of that transgression, \[so that no expiation of any
transgression is possible\]; and the only effect of his not performing
the prescribed expiatory rite would be that he shall also transgress the
law laying down such rite, and thus commit a further offence.

This, however, is not right Because, simply because the texts lay down
that the rite shall be performed, such rite does not become *compulsory*
\[and it is only the omission of a compulsory act that involves sin\].
All that is said is that the man becomes ‘cleansed’; from which it is
clear that this *cleansing* is the purpose served by the expiatory rite.
So that when expiatory rites are performed, one would wash off his sins;
and this would he done because of the sin having been committed by the
man himself.

It has been argued above that—“all that has been indicated is that sin
is incurred by the man who commits an act that has been forbidden by a
prohibitive text; and not that the sin becomes nullified by means of
expiations.”

But this also is not right. Because what has been indicated is that the
said act becomes a source of suffering; now in Expiation also there is
much suffering in the form of penances and charities; and it is quite
possible that the small amount of suffering undergone in the shape of
these latter should prevent the onset of the greater sufferings
threatening in the future. Just as a serious disease is prevented by the
eating of bitter medicines and keeping on low diet; or again, when a man
having committed an offence surrenders himself to the king and confesses
his guilt, saying—‘I have done such and such an act,’—the punishment
inflicted upon such a man is only half of what is prescribed for that
offence; while if he were arrested by the king’s officers and brought to
court, his punishment would be much severer.

Thus it is that the utility of the injunctions in question (of
expiations) becomes established. That the rites are destructive of the
effects of sins has to be admitted on the strength of the injunctions
themselves. It is for this reason that these rites have been called
‘expiatory’ of sins; for the sin is said to be ‘expiated’ only when it
has become deprived of its causal efficiency.

For the same reason the Expiatory Rite cannot be regarded as restoring
the rights and privileges lost by. reason of the guilt; since it is only
in the case of the five most heinous offences that any loss of
privileges has been mentioned,—the very term ‘becoming an outcast’
meaning *the loss of the privileges of the caste*.

In connection with the present context it should not be understood that
any such marked distinction is intended as that ‘in the case of
*unintentional* offences the expiation consists in the reciting of the
Veda, and in that of *intentional* offences of penances’;—because as a
matter of fact both kinds of expiation have been laid down in connection
with both kinds of offences; specially as every rule regarding an
expiatory rite starts off with the defining of the occasion for
expiation; *e.g.,* ‘The Slayer of a Brāhmaṇa shall make a cut, etc,
etc.’ (11.72)

Thus then, all that the verse means is that—‘there is heavy expiation in
the case of intentional offences, and a lighter one in that of
unintentional ones.’

“In fact when a man commits an act unintentionally, he is not the *doer*
of that act; as one is called the ‘doer’of an act only when he does it
intentionally; as we find people making such assertions as—‘This man is
not doing such and such an act, he is being made by fate to do it’
Further, it is only as done with a distinct motive towards it that an
act forms the subject of a prohibition; *e.g*., it is only when a man
evinces a desire for drinking wine that he is told ‘not to drink the
wine’; and if a man eager for a drink of water drinks wine thinking it
to be water, he does not incur any guilt; and this for the simple reason
that his action has not been prompted by the motive to drink wine. It
might be argued that it is only an action that has formed the subject of
an Injunction that cannot be forbidden. This is quite true, so far as
actions without a purpose are concerned; but of actions with a purpose,
a prohibition is always possible.”

In answer to this some people offer the following explanation:—What
forms the subject-matter of prohibitive texts is the affirmation of an
act as extending up to the sin that its commitment involves; just as it
does in the case of taking poison.

For these people the objection has no force at all. As regards the
taking of ‘poison,’ there can be no distinction as to its being done
intentionally or unintentionally; in either case the act must lead to
death.

Similarly in the case of such acts as ‘the Slaying of a Brāhmaṇa’ and
the like.

According to some people an act is done because of the declaration that
*it shall be done*, and it is not done because of the declaration that
*it shall not be done*. And by this view also prohibitions apply to only
one who is going to do some ordinary act; it is only when a man is going
to do an act that he is called its ‘doer.’ But a man can be a ‘doer’
even without knowing it, as when he falls down a river-bank. It cannot
be said that in such a case the man is called a ‘doer’ only in the
figurative sense; because the *doer* (nominative) has been defined only
as ‘one who is his own master regarding the act,’ and not as ‘one who
does an act *intentionally*

Further, from the present text itself it is clear that even acts due to
sheer negligence have been held to involve sin, and hence necessitate
expiation. What is the need of any further assumptions?—(46)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, (3.226), to the effect that the sin
accruing from ‘*non-degrading*’ offences even when intentional, is wiped
off by the performance of expiatory rites;—in *Aparārka*, (p. 1040)—in
*Madanapārijāta*, (p. 705);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 18), which says
that all that is meant by the mention of ‘*Vedabhyāsa*’ is that the
expiation of *unintentional* delinquencies is lighter than that for
*intentional* ones,—it explains ‘*pṛthagvidhaiḥ*’ as ‘other kinds of

‘*By chance*’—through his own negligence.

Some people read ‘*mohāt*’ in place of ‘*daivāt*.’ It is only *through
folly* (‘*mohāt*’) that people commit misdeeds; which man, who is not *a
fool*, shall ever transgress a scriptural injunction?

‘*By a previous misdeed*’—Some evil deeds committed in previous life,
whose effects have been already experienced, and which are inferred from
such physical defects as disfigured nails and the like.

The meaning of all this is as follows:—Transgressions done in the
present life are either intentional or unintentional; and the same
should be inferred also in the case of acts done in previous lives.

“But what is the expiation to be done in the case of disfigured nails
and such physical defects?”

The ‘*Kṛcchra*,’ the ‘*Atikṛcchra*’ and the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ are expiatory
rites applicable to all cases; though Vaśiṣṭha has declared that ‘the
man should perform that special expiatory rite somehow connected with
that which is indicative of the previous sin.’

What the present text thus means is that those who have not performed
the Expiatory Rite to which they are liable shall avoid associating with
righteous men; *i.e*., they should not mix with them in study and such
acta

Though the act of ‘associating’ pertains to both parties, and hence when
prohibited in reference to one, it becomes forbidden for both,—yet the
prohibition is again repeated (in 189) in the form that ‘righteous men
shall not associate with them,’ and this is on account of the agents
concerned in the two cases being different. If there were prohibition in
reference to one party only, then a transgressing of this prohibition
would render that, party alone liable to expiation,—and not the other
party, even though the latter also would have done the act of
‘associating.’ Hence with a view to indicate the liability of both
parties we have the two distinct prohibitions—one for the righteous and
another for the unrighteous. The upshot of all this is that no one
should associate with persons with black teeth and so forth, until they
have performed the necessary expiatory rite.—(47)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 774), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Daivāt*,’ *i.e*., for the sake of some offence
committed during the present life,—or for that of some offence the
antenatal committing of which is indicated by the presence, in the
person, of such defects as consumption, rotten nails, black teeth and so
forth,—one should perform the expiatory rites prescribed by Vaśiṣṭha;
but the expiation performed should be that prescribed for the presence
of the said defects, not that for the offences of which those defects
are known to be the effects,—e.g. the presence of rotten nails has been
held to he the effect of stealing gold in a previous life, or
consumption is held to be the effect of Brāhmaṇa-slaughter committed in
a previous life.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 2a);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 141 and 148), as forbidding association with
sinners.

\[See below.—12.53 *et seq*.\]

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.43-44).—‘They quote the following:—“Hear how the bodies
of those who, having committed various crimes, died a long time ago, and
were horn again, are marked:—A thief will have deformed nails, the
murderer of a Brāhmaṇa will he afflicted with white leprosy; he who has
drunk wine will have black teeth, and the violator of the Guru’s bed
will suffer from skin-diseases.”’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.6).—‘The man with deformed nails or black teeth should
perform the *Kṛcchra* penance of twelve days’ duration.’

*Viṣṇu* (45.1-33).—‘After having undergone the torments in the hells,
and having passed through the animal bodies, the sinners are born as
human beings with the following marks:—A criminal of the highest degree
shall have leprosy; a slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, consumption; a wine-drinker,
black teeth; a stealer of gold (belonging to a Brāhmaṇa), deformed
nails; a violator of his spiritual teacher’s bed a disease of the skin;
a calumniator, a stinking nose; a malicious informer, stinking breath; a
stealer of grain, a limb too little; one who steals by mixing (*i.e*.,
by taking good grain and replacing the same amount of bad grain in its
stead), a limb too much; a stealer of food, dyspepsia; a stealer of
words, dumbness; a stealer of clothes, white leprosy; a stealer of
horses, lameness; one who pronounces an execration against a God or a
Brāhmaṇa, dumbness; a poisoner, a stammering tongue; an incendiary,
madness; one disobedient to a Guru (father), the falling sickness; the
killer of a cow, blindness; the stealer of a lamb, the same; one who has
extinguished a lamp, blindness with one eye; a seller of tin, chowries,
or lead, is born a dyer of cloth; a seller of (horses or other) animals
whose foot is not cloven, is born a hunter: one who eats the food of a
person born from adulterous intercourse, is born as a man who suffers
his mouth to he abused; a thief (of other property than gold), is born a
bard; a usurer becoms epileptic; one who eats dainties alone, shall have
rheumatics; the breaker of a convention, a bald head; the breaker of a
vow of chastity, swelled legs; one who deprives another of his
subsistence, shall be poor; one who injures another (without
provocation), shall have an incurable illness. Thus according to their
particular sins, are men born, marked by evil-signs, sick, blind,
hump-backed, halting, one-eyed; others as dwarfs, or deaf, or dumb,
feeble-bodied (eunuchs, whitlows, and others). Therefore must penances
be performed by all means.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.209-215).—‘The Brāhmaṇa slayer becomes consumptive, the
wine-drinker has black teeth, the gold stealer has deformed nails; the
violator of the Guru’s bed suffers from skin diseases; the stealer of
food becomes dyspeptic; the stealer of words, dumb; the mixer of grains
has a limb too many; the back-biter has stinking nostrils; the stealer
of sesamum becomes the oil-drinking animal; calumniator has stinking
mouth; one who has intercourse with another’s wife and one who steals a
Brāhmaṇa’s property becomes a Brahmarākṣasa in a desolate forest; those
who steal gems are born in low castes; one who steals clothes suffers
from white leprosy.’

**(verses 11.49-52)**

By killing a Brāhmaṇa one becomes affected by *consumption*—a very
serious disease known among physicians by that name.

One who has intercourse with his preceptor’s wife suffers from
‘disfigured skin.’

The ‘*informer*’ has a nose emitting nauseous smell; and ‘*the false
caluminator has a foul-smelling mouth*.’

“The *caluminator* also is only an *informer*.”

True; but one of them (the former) assumes other people’s defects, while
the other describes only those that really exist;—that is the sole
difference between the two.

‘*Excess of limbs*’—more than the natural number.

‘*Adulterator*’—one who mixes commodities with inferior ones resembling
it, *e.g*., saffron with the *Kusumbha* flower.

‘*Dyspeptic*’—one who cannot digest the food eaten.

^(‘)*Dumbness*’—Incapability of speech; *e.g*., the idiot, the epileptic
and the like.

The rest is well known.

^(‘)*Deformed*.’—Their figure is despicable.

All this is the result of ‘*particular acts*.’ These acts bring about
the said effects instead of making the men sink into hell and suffer
after-death tortures; or even for those who, even though they have
passed through all these latter, have still some remnant left of the
force of their past misdeeds; or for those in whose case the force of
their meritorious deeds being greater, the effects of the evil deeds
have had no occasion to assert themselves. In all such cases there is a
‘residue’ of past acts.—(49-52)

‘*Vāgapahārakaḥ*.’—‘Stealer of speech’,—*i.e*., one who learns the Veda
by stealth’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘a plagiarist’
(Nārāyaṇa).

\[*The additional verse, relating to the ‘stealer of a lamp’ has been
translated by Buhler as part of the text; it has been so accepted by
Rāghavānanda and Rāmacandra, but not by the other commentators. We have
followed the text of Medhātithi here; hence from this verse onward our
verse-numbering will be one less than that in Buhler*\], This additional

(*a*) Intercourse with the Preceptor’s wife, (*b*) Theft, and (*c*)
Association with outcasts,—these are ‘*heinous offences*’ for all
castes;—‘wine-drinking’ is so only for the Brāhmaṇa.

^(‘)*Theft*’—stands here for the stealing of gold belonging to a
Brāhmaṇa; as is clear from another Smṛti text, which says that—‘The
stealing of Brāhmaṇa’s gold constitutes a *heinous offence*.’ The term
‘*pātaka*’ (offence) literally signifying ‘that which degrades,’ is
applied to all transgressions, major as well as minor, and, in the name
‘*mahā-pātaka*,’ the qualifying epithet ‘*mahā*’ is meant to indicate
the great seriousness of the offence.

‘*Association with these*’—with any one of them; details regarding this
are going to be described under 180 below.—(54)

[\[See

*Gautama* (21.1).—‘The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, he who drinks wine, the
violator of the Guru’s bed, he who has connection with the female
relations of his mother and of his father, or with sisters and their
female offspring, he who steals gold, an atheist, he who constantly
repeats reprehensible acts, he who does not cast off persons guilty of a
crime causing loss of caste and he who forsakes blameless relatives,—all
these become outcasts.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.7-8).—‘Stealing gold, crimes whereby one becomes
accused, homicide, neglect of the Vedas, causing abortion, incestuous
connection with relations born of the same womb as the mother or the
father, and with the offspring of such persons, drinking wine, and
intercourse with persons whose intercourse is forbidden; these are
actions that cause loss of caste.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.19-21).—‘They state that there are five *Mahāpātakas*:
stealing gold, the violation of Guru’s bed, drinking *Surā*, slaying a
learned Brāhmaṇa, and associating with outcasts, either spiritually or
matrimonially.’

*Viṣṇu* (35.1-2).—‘Killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, stealing
Brāhmaṇa’s gold, and sexual connection with a Guru’s wives are
*Mahāpātakas*; also social intercourse with such criminals.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.227).—‘Brāhmaṇa-slayer, wine-drinker, stealer (of

^(‘)*Samutkarṣe*’—The Locative ending denotes *purpose*; just as in the
expression ‘*carmaṇi dvīpinam hanti*’ (‘kills the tiger for the sake of
his skin’). When a man lies with the motive of securing honour for
himself, his offence is equal to that of killing a Brāhmaṇa. For
instance, on an occasion great honour or much wealth is expected to be
obtained by every one who is a Brāhmaṇa, or a Vedic scholar, or belongs
to a high family,—if one falsely represents himself as such; or when a
person needs a qualified recipient for his gifts, if one, though not so
qualified, represents himself to be as such. In such cases the man lies
‘*for self-aggrandisement*’; this is what is meant, and not any small
gain for oneself; even though this latter also may be called
‘*samutkarṣe*.’

One is said to ‘caluminate’ people when he falsely attributes evils to
him.

‘*Falsely harassing the preceptor*’—causing him pain and anxiety by
falsely telling him such things as ‘your unmarried daughter is
pregnant,’ and so forth; which implies needless hatred. Or,
‘*nirbandha*’ may stand for quarrelling with him before the King, or
bringing a false (barge against him. Says Gautama,—‘False accusation of
the Teacher, etc...... are equal to the heinous offences.’ (21.10)—(55)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Guroścālīkanirbandhaḥ*.’—‘Wrongfully going to law against the teacher’
(Medhātithi), or ‘falsely accusing the teacher’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja
and Kullūka);—‘Repeatedly doing what is disagreeable to the teacher’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p, 419), as
enumerating offences on the same footing as Brāhmaṇa-slaughter;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 1047), which adds the following notes:—On the occasion of
the examination of the disputed superiority of qualifications of two
rivals, if the Judge pronounces a false judgment, this act is as sinful
as the killing of a Brāhmaṇa; ‘*alīkanirbandha*’ is false
accusation;—and in *Madanapārijātā* (p. 807), which adds the explanation
that ‘when a man without knowing the our Vedas, represents himself to
the king as knowing them,—and some one is asked to examine the validity
of the claim—if this latter should make a false report, the sin incurred
by him is equal to that involved in Brāhmaṇa-slaughter’.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 177), which adds the following
notes—‘*Anṛtañca samutkarṣe*’ means the misrepresentation of oneself as
possessing qualities which are not really possessed, *e.g*., when a
Śūdra says ‘I am a Brāhmaṇa’ and wears the sacred thread,—or
misrepresentation regarding the qualifications of another person *e.g*.,
if one were to say of a learned Brāhmaṇa that he knows nothing,—this is
equal to ‘Brāhmaṇa-murder’,—*i.e*. involves the twelve-year
penance;—this refers to cases of *intentional* and *repeated*
acts,—‘*paiśuna*’ is backbiting to the king, and ‘*guroḥ* &c.’ is false
accusation of one’s father.

keeping up its study, he is said to ‘*neglect the Veda*.’ Or it may
stand for the disobedience of the injunction of Vedic study, as a
compulsory duty.

‘*Bearing false witness*’—even on occasions other than for
self-aggrandisement.

‘*Slaying*’—killing—‘of a friend.’

‘*Eating of forbidden and unfit food*.’—‘*Forbidden*,’ such as garlic
and the rest; ‘*unfit*,’—*i.e*., unpleasant. If such food is
intentionally eaten.—(56)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.231), to the effect that though
the offences here enumerated have been placed by Yājñavalkya in the same
category as ‘Brāhmaṇa-slaughter’, while Manu classes them with
‘wine-drinking’,—yet all that this implies is that there are alternative
expiatory rites.

It, is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1047), as placing on the same footing as
‘wine-drinking’, such offences as ‘forgetting’ and ‘reviling’ the Veda
and the killing of a friend; and the meaning of this is that there are
alternative expiatory rites;—it explains ‘*anādyam*’ as uneatable on
account of bad smell and the like.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 293) in support of the
view that these offences are ‘*anupātakas*’ ‘ancillary sins’, as
distinguished from ‘*upapātakas*’ ‘minor sins’.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijata* (p. 807), which makes the same remark
as *Mitākṣarā*;—and again on p. 825, where the following notes are
added:—According to *Smṛtimañjarī*, ‘*garhita*’ stands for onions and
such other forbidden food, and ‘*anādya*’ for impure food; while
according to *Kalpataru* ‘*garhita*’ stands for such food as, though not
forbidden by the scriptures, is deprecated by the people:—‘*anādyam*’,
garlic and such things;—the eating of these things is equal to
wine-drinking, only when it is done intentionally.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 177), which has the following
notes—‘*Brahmojjhatā*’ means ‘forgetting the Veda through neglect of
proper study,’—‘*Vedanindā*’, passing deprecatory remarks against the
words and contents of the Vedas—‘*Suhṛdvadha*’, murdering of a friend
other than the Brāhmaṇa,—‘*garhītānna*’ is ‘food of the lowest
born’,—‘*garhitādya’, is* forbidden food, *e.g*., mushrooms and so
forth, of which *repeated* eating is meant here. It notes the reading
‘*garhitānādya*’ as adopted by *Kalpataru*, which explains ‘*garhita*’
as ‘what is forbidden by the scriptures’, and ‘*anādya*’ as ‘what is
very much deprecated among the people, such as garlic &c.’

‘*Deposit*’—even such as consists of not very valuable things.

‘*Men*.’—This term stands for the *kind*; hence the stealing of women
also stands on the same footing. This same sin accrues to him who, after
having betrothed his daughter to one man, gives her ultimately to
another, even when no defects have been found in the former bridegroom.
This is what has been described as the man ‘falling upon a lie.’—(57)

‘*Uterine sisters*’—sisters horn of the same mother as oneself.

‘*Virgins*’— unmarried women.

‘*Low-born women*’—wild women.

‘*Friend*’—companion; his ‘*women*.’

The use of the generic term ‘women’ indicates that it is not only the
*wife* that is meant What is meant is a woman *kept* for carnal
purposes, by the friend or the son.

What we hold however is that, even though the text has used the generic
term^(‘)women,’ yet it cannot be regarded as putting the *married* and
the *unmarried* women on the same footing; because such an equalisation
would be highly unreasonable.

What is said here is not for the purpose of indicating what the exact
expiatory rite in the case should be, but with a view to indicate \[the
seriousness of the crime; which, of course, means that\] the expiation
also should be heavy. This is what has been set forth in the
declaration—‘these shall be heavy in the case of serious, and light in
that of lighter, crimes.’ If all this were for this purpose of
indicating the exact expiatory rite, it should have occurred under the
section dealing with these rites proper. Further, since^(‘)bearing false
witness,’ and^(‘)slaying of a friend,’ are here placed on the same
footing as^(‘)wine-drinking,’ the expiation for these could not be
prescribed as the same as that in the case
of^(‘)Brāhmaṇa-killing’;—secondly, the^(‘)falsely harassing the
Preceptor’ has here been declared to be equal to^(‘)Brāhmaṇa-killing,’
and yet later on it has been considered necessary to lay down again for
this offence the same expiation as for^(‘)Brāhmaṇa-killing’;—thirdly,
carnal intercourse with a^(‘)virgin’ has here been said to be equal to
the^(‘)violating of the Preceptor’s bed,’ and yet it was considered
necessary to prescribe again for this offence the same expiation as that
for the said^(‘)violating of the Preceptor’s bed.’ From all this it is
clear that the present equalising of the various sins here with one or
the other of the heinous offences is not meant to be an injunction of
the necessary expiatory rites.

Other people think that even though all that is meant is to indicate the
seriousness of the crimes, yet there is nothing unreasonable in the
equalisation here set forth; which may, therefore, be taken as meant to
indicate the exact expiations. As for the fact that, even
though^(‘)bearing false witness,’ and ‘slaying a friend’ are here put on
the same footing as^(‘)winedrinking.’ yet the exact expiation for it has
been prescribed to be the same as that for Brāhmaṇa-killing,—this means
simply that the two expiations are meant to be optional. Where there is
absolute equalisation, there can be no option; as is clear from Verse 87
below.—(58)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.231), to the effect that the
‘intercourse’ meant here is the actual consummation of the act, as is
clear from the use of the term ‘*retaḥseka*’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1048),
which also adds that if the intercourse ceases before actual emission,
the offence is not equal to the ‘violation of the Teacher’s bed—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 251), which adds that this refers to
cases where, the act is repeated for fifteen days;—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 844), which notes that the use of the expression ‘*retaḥseka*’
indicates that if the act ceases before emission, it involves an
expiation lighter than that in the case of ‘the violation of the
Teacher’s bed’;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 177), which has the
following notes—‘*Svayonyāsu*’, Sapiṇḍa-women, and such women as are
blood-relations of one’s father or mother,—‘*kumārīṣu*’ Brāhmaṇa
virgins,—‘*Antyajāsu*’, Caṇḍāla and other low-born girls,—‘*Sakhyuḥ
strīṣu*’, wives of Brāhmaṇa friends,—‘*putrastrīṣu*’, wives of sons born
of wives of different castes, or wives of sons other than the ‘body
born’.

**(verses 11.58-66)  
**

*Gautama* (21.1).—(See under 54.)

Do. (21.11).—‘The guilt of a minor offence rests on those who are
defilers of company, or killers of kine, or those who forget the Veda,
those who pronounce the Vedic texts for sinners, students who break the
vow of chastity, and those who allow the time of initiation to pass.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.5, 13).—‘Trading with merchandise of any description;
the following are the minor offences involving loss of caste.
Intercourse with women who should not he approached, cohabitation with
the female friend of a female *Guru*, with the female friend of a male
*Guru*, with an *Apapātra* woman, and a female outcast,—following the
medical profession, sacrificing for the multitude, living by the stage,
following the profession of the dancing master, or singing master or
acting master, tending cows and buffaloes, and so forth, and also
fornication.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.7-9, 14-15, 17-18).—‘The following acts cause loss of
caste: stealing gold, crimes that make one accused, homicide, neglect of
the Vedas, causing abortion, incestuous connection with relations born
of the same womb as one’s father or mother, or with the offsprings of
such relations, drinking wine, intercourse with persons intercourse with
whom is forbidden. That man falls who has connection with a female
friend of a female *Guru*, or with a female friend of a male *Guru*, or
with any married woman. Eating forbidden flesh, as of a dog, a man, a
village-cock or village pigs, or carnivorous animals; eating what is
left by a Śūdra, the cohabitation of Aryans with *Apapātra* women. Some
say that these also lead to loss of caste.’

*Viṣṇu* (36.4-7).—‘Sexual connection with a paternal aunt, with the
maternal grandmother, with a maternal aunt, with the mother-in-law, with
the Queen—are crimes equal to connection with a *guru’s* wife;—and so is
sexual intercourse with the father’s or mother’s sister, and with one’s
own sister;—and sexual connection with the wife of a learned Brāhmaṇa,
or a priest, or an *Upādhyāya*, or a friend;—and with a sister’s female
friend, or with a woman of one’s own race, with a woman belonging to the
Brāhmaṇa caste, with a Brāhmaṇa maiden, with a low-caste woman, with a
woman in her courses, with a woman come for protection, with a female
ascetic, or with a woman entrusted to one’s own care.’

Do. (37.6-10, 13-33).—‘Abandoning one’s holy fire, or father, mother,
son or wife;—eating forbidden food, or food of those whose food should
not he eaten;—appropriating to one’s self what belongs to
another;—sexual intercourse with another man’s wife; sacrificing for
persons for whom it is forbidden to sacrifice;—killing a Kṣatriya or a
Vaiśya or a Śūdra, or a cow,—selling articles that should not be
sold,—for an elder brother to suffer his younger brother to marry before
him, for a younger brother to marry before his elder brother,—to give a
girl in marriage to either of these two,—or to perform the nuptial
ceremony for him,—to allow the proper time for *Upanayana* to pass
off,—to teach the Veda for a reward,—to he taught the Veda by a hired
teacher,—to be employed in mines,—to make large instruments,—cutting
trees, shrubs, creepers, long climbing plants, or herbs,—to make a
living by prostituting one’s own wife,—trying to overcome others by
incantations or forcible means; cooking for one’s own self,—omitting to
pay one’s debts to God, Sages and *Pitṛs*,—studying irreligious
hooks,—Atheism,—subsisting by a reprehensible act,—intercourse with
woman who drinks wine;—these are crimes of the fourth degree.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.231, 234-42).—‘Intercourse with a friend’s wife, with a
maiden, with one’s own offsprings, with a Caṇḍāla woman, with one’s
*Sagotra* woman, with one’s sons’ wives,—is declared to be equal to the
violating of the *guru’s* bed. Killing cows, apostacy, theft,
non-payment of debts, omitting to establish the sacred fires, selling
what should not be sold, marrying before the elder brother, learning
Veda from a hired teacher, teaching the Veda for payment, adultery,
permitting one’s self to be superseded in marriage by the younger
brother, usury, manufacturing salt, killing a woman, a Vaiśya, a Śūdra
or a Kṣatriya, making a living through reprehensible things, atheism,
breaking the vow of celibacy, selling of sons, stealing grains or base
metals or cattle, sacrificing for those not entitled to perform
sacrifices, abandoning of father, mother or son, selling of tanks or
gardens, defiling a maiden, sacrificing for one who has married before
his elder brother and giving of girl in marriage to such a person,
dishonesty, omitting of the observances and restrictions, undertaking of
an act for one’s own benefit, intercourse with a wine-drinking woman,
abandoning of Vedic study or of the sacred fires, neglecting one’s sons,
forsaking of relatives, cutting trees for fuel, making a living by one’s
own wife, or by medicines or by killing, making of murderous machines,
being addicted to vicious habits, selling one’s self, serving under a
Śūdra, making friendships with low men, intercourse with low-born women,
omitting the prescribed life-stages, getting fat with food given by
others, studying of evil sciences, superintending mines, selling one’s
wife;—each of these is a *minor sin*, an *upapātaka*.’

The author now proceeds to describe the ‘*Minor offences*.’

‘*Those unworthy to sacrifice*,’—*i.e*., the outcast, the Śūdra and so
forth,—‘sacrificing’ f or these. The use of the affix ‘*ṇya*’ in the
nominal sense is a Vedic anomaly.

‘*Selling oneself*’— Making oneself a slave, subservient to another man,
and thus putting himself on the same footing as the cow and such other
properties as are sold.

Others read—‘*pāradāryamavikrayam*’—‘adultery and selling what should
not be sold.’

What is meant by ‘*selling oneself*’ is taking service under an
unrighteous master, when there is only slight trouble, in the shape of
want of livelihood and the like.

The ‘*abandoning of the teacher*’—means the neglect of attention due to
him; *e.g*., having recourse to another teacher, while the former
teacher is quite competent to teach.

Similarly with the ‘*abandoning of* one’s *father and mother*.’

What is reprehensible is the abandoning of these when they are not
outcasts. If they have become outcasts, their abandoning would be only
right and proper.

The Construction is—‘*the abandoning of Vedic study and the Fire*’ The
‘*abandoning of Vedic study*’ means not carrying out in practice the
injunction that ‘one should recite the Veda everyday.’

“Would the omission of this study for a single day, or for one year,
Constitute this offence?”

Since the text contains no qualification, it would seem that omission
for even one day would constitute the offence.

This, however, is not right. Because the injunction of daily study is a
compulsory one; and a distinct expiation is going to be set forth later
on for the omission of a compulsory duty. Hence what is meant here is
such neglect as leads to the Veda being entirely forgotten.

This neglect having been declared (under 56) to be equal to
‘wine-drinking,’ the present text is meant to indicate an alternative
expiation; the exact alternative to be employed should be determined by
the comparative seriousness or otherwise of the neglect in any
particular case. For instance, if the neglect of Vedic study is due to
the man being engaged on another Vedic rite, his offence would be a
*minor* one; while if it is due to the man giving himself up to luxury,
or to moneymaking, or to quarrels,—his offence would be equal to
‘wine-drinking.’

As the ‘fire’ is spoken of in the singular, it should be understood to
mean the *domestic fire*;—the *Śrauta* Fires having been all along
spoken of in the plural.

“In connection with the offences of abandoning *the Śrauta* Fires, the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* penance has been declared to be the expiatory rite. In the
present context also, since the act would be of the nature of a *minor*
offence, the expiation would consist of the same penance.”

There is no force in this objection; since in connection with *minor
offences* also, diverse expiatory rites have been laid down;—the
comparative seriousness or otherwise of the offence and the heaviness or
lightness of the expiation being determined in each case by
considerations of the capacity of the man concerned. And when the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* penance has been *mentioned* as *the* expiation for *minor
offences*, what is meant is that that penance represents the lowest
limit ‘*Abandoning of the son*’— means omitting to support him, or
turning him out of the house—when he is no longer an infant and is duly
qualified. In the abandoning of a son who has become an outcast, there
would be no wrong.—(59)

‘*Defiling a maiden*’;—*i.e*., having recourse to her in the spirit of
bravado that ‘she has not yet been touched by man’; or, the depriving
her of her chastity by touching her generative organ with the toe or
such other parts of the body;—in fact doing all these, with the sole
exception of actual sexual intercourse;—which latter has been declared
to be equal to ‘the violating of the Preceptor’s bed.’

‘*Usury*’— Making money by this means as a means of living,—even in
normal times. Vaśiṣṭha has declared that ‘usury consists in lending
money or grains on interest.’ This is a scriptural technicality, not
subject to the notions of the ordinary world.

‘*Breaking of a vow*.’—A ‘vow’ consists in the taking of such resolution
as—‘I shall rather starve than partake of food in the house of such and
such a person eating at whose place is forbidden’; and if one does not
keep to this resolve, it would be ‘breaking of the vow.’

“As a matter of fact, the name ‘vow,’ *vrata*, is given to a restriction
that one voluntarily puts upon himself; and if the resolve is a
voluntary one, how could deviation from that constitute a transgression
of the scriptures? it has been said that ‘by omitting to do what is
enjoined one becomes liable to expiation’; and the resolution in the
case in question is not ‘what is enjoined.”’

The answer to this is as follows:—It is true that in the initial stage
the vow is purely voluntary; but the *keeping* of it is what has been
‘enjoined’ by the scriptures. Just as in the case of the Saurya and
other sacrifices performed with a view to definite rewards,—the act, in
its initial stage, is purely voluntary; but the continuation and
completion of it (when once begun) is what is ‘enjoined’; the act could
be discontinued only either if the performer had ceased to desire the
particular reward, or if the reward were actually obtained; in all such
cases the performer would be blamed as being energetic only in
undertaking an act.

As regards the observances to be kept by the Accomplished Student, the
text is going to lay down a very light expiation for the neglect of
these. And this may be regarded as an optional alternative to what is
here laid down.

‘*Garden*’— flower-gardens and parks, etc.

Another *Smṛti* declares all kinds of land as ‘not to be sold.’—(61)

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 192), which has the

piercing with the finger her private parts,—‘*vārdhuṣitvam*’ (which is
its reading for ‘*vārdhuṣyam*’) for the Brāhmaṇa or the
Kṣātriya,—‘*vratāt cyutiḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*vratalopanam*’),

one,—‘*apatyasya*’, of the various kinds of children.

‘*Relations*.’—The maternal uncle, cousins and others, even apart from
one’s uterine brothers. If one has the means, it behoves him to support
all these, if they be starving. This is what has been spoken of above in
Verse 9.

“In face of the present text, the mention of the abandoning of one’s son
(in 60) becomes superfluous.”

It is not superfluous. The mention of both is like the case where all
web-footed birds having been forbidden in general, the Swan is specially
prohibited separately.

Hence the abandoning of the mother and those mentioned in the former
verse is also a *minor offence*, like what is mentioned in the present
verse; with this difference only that this latter is less serious.

‘*Teaching for wages and learning from a paid teacher*’—*i.e*., if one
learns from a paid teacher, when unpaid teachers are available.

There would be nothing wrong in the cutting down of trees for purposes
of fuel for sacrificial performances; specially as one cannot, be sure
of the purity of dead trees.

‘*Undertaking of the act*’—of cooking. There is the prohibition that,
even when distressed by hunger, one shall not. do the cooking for
himself alone; and it is for this reason that we explain the term ‘act’
to mean the *act of cooking*. If, on the other hand, we took the term to
stand for *action in general*, then it would be necessary to assume the
necessary prohibition of such action in general, merely on the strength
of the fact that an expiation is laid down for it; as there could be no
expiation for an act that, is not prohibited; as it has been declared
that ‘by doing what is forbidden one becomes liable to expiatory rites’
(44). When, however, we take the word to mean as explained above, then
the expiation laid down is quite in keeping with a well-known
prohibition, and there is no need for assuming one.

‘*Eating forbidden food*.’—*Objection*.—“The Eating of Forbidden Food
having been already mentioned above (57), why should there be a
repetition of it here?”

*Answer*.—It has been mentioned again for the purpose of indicating an
alternative Expiation;—the sense being that the expiation prescribed
before is for repeated acts of eating forbidden food; while the one
indicated by the present text is for doing it for the first time.—(64)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Omission of Fire-laying*’—is an offence in the case of a man who has
been married and has got a son, and is possessed of the requisite means.
The author of the *Smṛti* thinks that since the Vedic texts laying down
Fire-laying do not contain any conditions, they clearly indicate the
compulsory character of that rite.

“How can the act of *laying* of the fire be regarded as enjoined by
Vedic texts? If what is mentioned in one context were to be taken as
*enjoined* in connection with another, this would lead to a great
confusion regarding the true meaning of the scriptures. What the texts
are actually found to prescribe are the *Fires*; how can that be taken
as prescribing the act of *laying*?”

It is true that the *Fires* have been prescribed by such texts
as—‘Libations are to be offered into the Āhavavīya Fire,’ and so forth;
but, as a matter of fact, these Fires cannot be obtained without
*laying* (*or kindling*); it is for this reason that when the *Fires*
are prescribed, it is understood that the act of *laying* them is also
prescribed.

“If the laying be meant simply for the obtaining of the Fires, then the
injunction would apply to only those persons who perform the rite of
Fire-laying; and not to one who has no fires at all. Nor is the act of
*laying* compulsory, in the way in which the life-long rites are
compulsory. How then win *the omission of Fire-laying* be an offence?”

The passage—‘by not doing what is enjoined, etc., etc.,’—has clearly
laid down that one is liable to expiation if he omits to do what is
enjoined; and the act of Fire-laying has been enjoined by such texts as
‘one shall lay the Fires.’

“It is true that the act has been enjoined; but it is so neither with a
view to the obtaining of heaven, nor for any other purpose; it has been
enjoined only for the purpose of obtaining the Fires. As for the Fires,
their use is well known; so that the man who needs them shall obtain
them by the means thus enjoined,—and others will not obtain them. What
possibility would be there for the *omitting of what has been
enjoined*,—which would render the person liable to Expiation? How can a
man be regarded as an offender if he fails to obtain gold, for
instance?”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—From the present text itself it
is understood that if a man is entitled to Firelaying, he must obtain
the Fires by means of the rites prescribed.

*Theft*—of articles other than those specifically named in this
connection.

^(‘)*Debts*.’—This refers to the non-performance of those acts that have
been laid down as paying off the ‘four debts’ (to the Gods, the Pitṛs,
to Men and to the Fires).

‘*Bad books*’—*e.g*., those written by *Cārvākas* and *Nirgranthas*;
those that are not trustworthy, and have no connection with Vedic rites
or their effects.

‘*Histrionic art*’—acting, dancing and singing.—(65)

‘*Base Metals*’—Pans and pots made of iron, copper, eta “‘Stealth’ in
general has been already mentioned in the preceding verse.”

This objection has been already answered by as (under 62). Or,
‘stealing’ here may be taken as standing for what is taken on loan but
not repaid, or what is taken fraudulently,—and not for what is
ordinarily known as ‘stealing.’

‘*Addicted to drinking wine*’;—the Brāhmaṇa’s intercourse,—*i.e*., lying
with, or actual congress with Kṣatriya and Vaiśya women.

‘*Killing of women*’—of the Brāhmaṇa woman also.

‘*Causing pain*.’—Inflicting physical suffering with a stick or with the
hand.

“What is it *that should not be smelt*? There is no prohibition of the
*smelling* of anything, as there is of *eating*.

Nor does it follow that what should not he *eaten* is also what should
not be *smelt*. Because butter and other things got together for
sacrificial performance are what should not he *eaten*,—and yet these
are not held to be what should not be smelt.” Our answer to this is as
follows.—Such things as garlic, onion, human excreta and the like, on
account of their foul smell, cause pain to the olfactory organ; and it
is these things that are meant; and since ‘wine’ is also mentioned in
this context, those tilings also are meant to be included the *eating*
whereof has been forbidden. But rotten wood and such things are not
meant

‘*Cheating*’—dishonesty; an unclean heart; saying one thing, doing
another and thinking of a third.—(67)

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.15, 16).—‘The following offences make men
impure:—gambling, performing incantations, subsisting on corn-gleaning
while not performing Agnihotra, subsisting on alms after studentship,
living at the teacher’s house longer than four months after finishing
study and teaching a person like the last, making a living by astrology
and so forth.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.12-18).—‘Now follows the enumeration of offences that
make men impure: cohabitation of Ārya women with Śūdras, eating
forbidden flesh, as of a dog, a man, etc., eating human excreta, eating
a Śūdra’s leavings, and the cohabitation of Āryas with *apapātra*
women;—some people declare that these also cause loss of caste.’

*Viṣṇu* (41.1-4).—‘Killing birds, amphibious animals, and aquatic
animals, and worms or insects, eating herbs resembling intoxicants,—such
are the crimes causing defilement.’

^(‘)*Hut*’—a house built of grass and leaves, capable of resisting rain,
heat and cold.

‘*Samāḥ*’—years.

‘*Subsisting on alms*.’—Another Smṛti text lays down that these alms
shall be obtained from twelve houses, not in close proximity to one
another.

‘*The head of the dead man*’—Either the head of the man killed by him,
or a wooden or some other image of the head, shall be held aloft Such is
the explanation given by some people.

But men knowing the right meaning of words do not accept this
explanation as this is not what is meant by the term ‘*śavaśiraḥ*.’

</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

**(verses 11.72-86)**

*Gautama* (22.2-6).—‘He who has intentionally slain a Brāhmaṇa shall
emaciate himself and thrice throw himself into the fire;—or he may
become in battle the target for armed men;—or remaining chaste, he may,
during twelve years, enter the village only for the purpose of
begging,—carrying the foot of a bedstead and a skull in his hand, and
proclaiming his deed. If he meets an *Ārya*, he shall step out of the
road. Standing by day and sitting at night, and bathing in the morning,
at noon and in the evening, he may be purified after twelve years,—or by
saving the life of a Brāhmaṇa; or if he is thrice vanquished in trying
to recover the property of a Brāhmaṇa stolen by robbers, or by bathing
with the priests at the end of the *Āśvamedha* sacrifice;—or at the end
of any other sacrifice, provided that an Agniṣṭut forms part of it. The
same penance should be performed even if he has attempted the life of a
Brāhmaṇa, but failed to kill him; likewise if he has killed a Brāhmaṇa
woman who had bathed after her monthly course.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.2-6).—‘The murderer of a learned Brāhmaṇa shall
practise the following penance during twelve years:—Carrying a skull and
the foot of a bedstead, dressed in ass skin, staying in the forest;
making a skull his flag, he shall cause a hut to be built in the
cremation ground and reside there; going to seven houses to heg food,
while proclaiming his deed, he shall support life with whatever he gets
and shall fast if he obtains nothing. Or he may offer an *Āśvamedha*, a
*Gosava* or an *Agniṣṭut*; or he may bathe with the priests on the
completion of the *Āśvamedha*. They also quote the following:—“He who
unintentionally kills a Brāhmaṇa becomes sinful according to law; the
sages declare that he may be purified if he did it unintentionally. But
no expiation is possible for a wilful murderer.”

*Āpastamba* (1.24.11-22).—‘The Brāhmaṇa-slayer shall erect a hut in the
forest, restrain his speech, carry the skull like the flag and cover his
body from his navel to his knees with a quarter of a hempen cloth. The
path for him when he goes to the village is the space between the
tracks; and if he sees another *Ārya*, he shall step out of the road He
shall go to the village carrying a broken dish of metal of inferior
quality. He may go to seven houses only, crying—“Who will give alms to
the accursed?” That is how he should gain his livelihood. If he does not
obtain anything, he must fast. Whilst performing this penance, he should
tend cows. After having performed this penance for twelve years, he must
perform that customary ceremony which may gain for him re-admission into
society. Or, he may build a hut on the path of robbers and live there,
trying to recover from them the cows of Brāhmaṇas; and he becomes free
from his sin after he has been worsted by them thrice, or after he has
vanquished them.’

Do. (1.25.11).—‘A non-Brāhmaṇa who has killed a Brāhmaṇa shall go to the
battle-field and place himself between the two hostile armies; there
they shall kill him.’

Do. (1.28.21 and 1.29.1).—‘He who has killed a learned Brāhmaṇa shall
put on ass’ skin or dog’s skin with the hair turned outside and take up
a human skull as his drinking vessel; and he shall take the foot of a
bedstead instead of a staff, and proclaiming his deed, he shall go about
saying—“Who gives alms to the murderer of a *Bhrūṇa?*” Obtaining thus
his livelihood, he shall dwell in an empty house, or under a
tree,—having no intercourse with *Āryas*. Thus shall he live until his
last breath. After death his sin is taken off.’

*Viṣṇu* (35.6).—‘Those who have committed a “*Mahāpātaka*” are purified
by Āśvamedha and by visiting all *Tīrthas*.’

Do. (50.1-6, 15).—‘The man should make a hut of leaves in a forest and
live in it; he shall bathe three times a day: he shall collect alms,
going from one village to another, and proclaiming his own deed; he
shall sleep on the grass; this is called the *Mahāvrata*. He who has
killed a Brāhmaṇa must perform this for twelve years. One who is
performing this penance should carry the skull of the person slain, as
his flag.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.243-250).—‘One who has killed a Brāhmaṇa shall carry a
skull and a flag, shall live on alms, eating very little and proclaiming
his deed; living thus for twelve years he attains purity. Or he may
attain purity by saving the life of a Brāhmaṇa, or that of twelve cows;
as also by joining in the final bath of the *Āśvamedha* sacrifice. The
Brāhmaṇa-slayer may also become purified if he relieves the pain of a
long-suffering Brāhmaṇa, or relieves from danger a cow on the road. If
robbers have taken away a Brāhmaṇa’s entire property and the Brāhmaṇa
slayer recovers it from them, or if he is himself killed in the attempt,
or if he is even wounded in the attempt, he becomes purified. Or he may
offer his body into the fire beginning with the hairs and ending with
the marrow, indue order. Or he may attain purity by becoming killed in
battle;—he is purified even if he is mortally wounded but does not die.
Or he is purified by reciting the Vedic text thrice; eating very little
and going along the Sarasvatī river from its mouth towards its source.
Or he may attain purity by giving to a proper person a large amount of
wealth to his satisfaction.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.25-28).—‘The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa shall kindle a fire and
offer therein to Death the following eight oblations consisting of
portions of his own body—(l) hair, (2) skin, (3) blood, (4) flesh, (5)
sinews (6) fat, (7) bones, (8) marrow; (with appropriate mantras). Or he
shall fight for the sake of the King, or for the sake of Brāhmaṇas, and
die in battle facing the foe. It is declared in the Veda that “a
murderer who remains thrice unvanquished, or is thrice defeated in
battle, becomes pure.’”

*Parāśara* (8.42).—(Same as Manu, 80.)

*Mahābhārata* (12.335.4-11).—‘He shall eat only once, begging alms and
performing his duties; taking a begging bowl in his band, moving on
wooden sandals, celebate and ever alert; free from jealousy, sleeping on
the ground, proclaiming bis deed among people; living thus for twelve
years, the Brāhmaṇa-slayer becomes absolved (then follow Manu’s verses
74, 76, 77).

He should offer himself as the target, when archers are practising. Or,
ho may invite, in battle, the strokes of the weapons of the armed men.

‘*By his own will*.’—This shows that if he happens to go to the place
and he struck dead only by chance,—this would not purify him.

‘*Cognisant*’— who knows that the man is exposing himself as an
expiation. Or, it may mean that, they should be well-versed in the
Science of Archery.

‘*He may throw himself into fire*, *thrice*.’—Rising, he should throw
himself again and again, three times.—(73)

“According to the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, which Kullūka and Rāghavānanda quote,
these two penances and that mentioned in the next verse are to be
performed by a Kṣatriya who slew a Brāhmaṇa,—those ending in death by an
offender who, himself destitute of good qualities, killed a learned
*Śrotriya*, and the lighter ones by an eminent king who unintentionally
caused the death of a worthless Brāhmaṇa.” (Buhler).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 405), which
adds that the various alternatives here laid down are to be understood
to vary with such circumstances of each case as that of the act being
intentional or otherwise, the person killed being learned or ignorant
and so forth;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1060), which explains ‘*viduṣām*’ as
‘persons prescribing the expiation for him’; and adds that in the
absence of such persons he should voluntarily make himself the target of
persons who may be engaged in fighting.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.244) as indicating that there is freedom
of choice for the man who has committed the offence;—again under 2.247,
where the meaning is explained as the man should throw himself into the
fire by plunging into it headlong three times.

It is only the lord of a kingdom that is entitled to the performance of
a Horse-sacrifice; as the sacrificial fee prescribed in that connection
is such gold and other metals as have been won from the Eastern and
other quarters.

Those persons who have not performed the Fire-laying rite are not
entitled to the performance of any sacrifice. Nor would they he
justified in laying the Fires for the purpose of these sacrifices only;
because the rites for the purposes of expiation are to be done only
along with their own accessory details, and ‘Fire-laying’ does not form
the accessory of any of these sacrifices.—(74)

‘*Svarjitā*.’—‘*Svarjit*’ is the name of a sacrifice, according to

*his* *maintenance*’:—That is the giving of the property would be equal
to making a gift to him of his life.

‘*Sacrificial food*.’—Food fit for ascetics; such as *Nīvara* and other
corns; also such village-produce as butter, milk and such things.

‘*Along each stream*.’—Of the Sarasvatī river there are several
branch-streams; and along each one of these he should walk.

‘*With* *food restrained*’—desisting from food.

‘*Text* *of* *the Veda*’—consisting of the ‘mantra’ and ‘Brāhmaṇa’
portions. This he shall repeat thrice.

With regard to these Expiatory Rites, the following is the final
conclusion:—(*A*) In the ease of one intentionally killing a common
Brāhmaṇa, the ‘twelve-year-long penance’ is an alternative to ‘becoming
the target, of armed men.’ The ‘twelve-year-old penance’ does not end in
death; yet, if in the interval the man dies off by chance, the expiation
would have been only half-done, and hence the purification not being
complete, the guilt would not cease;—in the case of the other
alternative, on the other hand, the man becomes freed from sin then and
there; and it would be by sheer chance that the man, struck with arrows,
would not die. Hence, in any particular case, the one or the other
alternative expiation might be prescribed, in accordance with one’s
wish.—(*B*) As regards ‘falling into Fire,’ this should be done only in
cases where the individual Brāhmaṇa killed was endowed with Vedic
learning and such other superior qualities; and this ‘falling’ should be
in the sacrificial fire. They have a saying on this point.—‘For the
Brāhmaṇa-slayer there are three conditions:—(1) dying, (2) cutting off
of limbs with weapons, and (3) consignment to the

Sacrificial fire.’ There can be no duplication in the case of those
penances that end in death; as, during a single life, no one can die
twice. Hence, where such duplication is necessary, it should be secured
by making the man suffer additional torture. In the case of the
‘Twelve-year Penance,’ no such duplication would be right; for what man
is there who would he possessed of the energy of the gods, which would
enable him to perform a rite for twenty-four years? Specially as, if at
the end of a certain year, the man were to die off, the entire expiation
would become frustrated.—(*C*) As regards the Horse-sacrifice
(prescribed in 75), it is an optional alternative permissible for the
three higher castes, only when it is possible for the person concerned
to perform it—(d) As regards the ‘Gosava’ and other sacrifices
(prescribed in 75), these would be admissible only in a case where the
slaying is done unintentionally and the slayer happens to be a highly
qualified person.—(*E*) ‘Walking eight hundred miles’ is admissible in a
case where the killing is done intentionally and the person killed is a
common Brāhmaṇa; and so on with the rest In 75, ‘*tṛvṛtā*’ (triple) is
an epithet of ‘*Agniṣṭutā*.’ Similarly the ‘*Svarjit-gosava*’ and the
‘*Abhijit-Viśvajit*’ constitute two expiatory rites.—(77)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.249), to the effect that the food
to be eaten should be ‘*haviṣya*’ only;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 1060),
which adds that ‘*niyatāhāra*’ means that the food should be either
small in quantity or of ‘*haviṣya*’ kind only;—the man becomes purified
by reciting the text of the Veda three times,—or by being restrained in
food and going along the Sarasvatī from its mouth upwards to its source.

This verse sets forth certain optional details regarding the
‘Twelve-year Penance,’—the ‘shaving’ being the only additional factor
laid down.

The man living under a tree in the hermitage,—this being an alternative
to the ‘hut’ (prescribed in 73).

“How is it that this alternative was not mentioned along with the other
one (in 73)?”

The older writers have explained that this has not been done, because
the author desired it to be understood that all that follows after the
present verse pertains to the ‘Twelve-year Penance,’ and it does not
constitute a distinct penance. If in the course of the treatment of one
subject, an entirely new subject is introduced, it becomes something
wholly different; and the introducing of a wholly different subject
before the one already taken up has been finished, would be highly
objectionable. If the rite thus interpolated were an independent one,
the only thing one could do would be to adopt in practice only one of
the two.—(78)

This verse lays down an option regarding observances during the twelve
years of penance (verse 72)—according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Kullūka;—according to Nārāyaṇa it provides a general rule for all
penances.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.243), which cays that this is an
option to what has been said in verse 72;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 788),
which also adds that this lays down an option;—and in *parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, pp. 399-400), which notes that the ‘*vā*’ of the
‘*Kṛtavāpanaḥ*’ indicates that ‘shaving’ is an option to the wearing of
matted locks.

becomes purified, even though his own life may have been saved, and
(*b*) even though he may not succeed in saving the cow or the Bārhmaṇa,
he becomes purified, if he has tried his best and lost his life in the
attempt to save them.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1058), which adds the following
notes:—This is to be taken in connection with the ‘Twelve years
penance’; even though the man may not succeed in saving the cow or the
Brāhmaṇa, if he has tried his best, and perishes in the attempt, he
becomes purified; and if he has succeeded in saving them, he becomes
purified, even though he may not have lost his life in the attempt.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.244), which adds that ‘saving the
Brāhmaṇa’ and ‘perishing for the sake of the Brāhmaṇa’ are two distinct

‘*Fights*’—Takes up arms, or becomes wounded in the fight;—‘*at least
thrice*’—He should repeat the act at least three times. If he does the
fighting, he becomes absolved, even though he might have been killed
without having saved the Brāhmaṇa.

‘*Reconquers his entire property*.’—If the Brāhmaṇa’s property has been
taken away by thieves, if he wins it back for him, he becomes
absolved;—as also if he ‘*gives up his life*’ for the sake of the
Brāhmaṇa.

“*Giving up one’s life in defence of the Brāhmaṇa* has been already
mentioned (in the preceding verse).”

True; but what has been said in the preceding verse is that ‘the man
becomes purified if he rescues, by fighting or by some other physical
means, (1) a cow stuck in the mire, or (2) a cow being taken away by
robbers, or (3) a Brāhmaṇa, being carried away either by his enemies, or
by robbers, or by a stream’; while in the present verse what is
mentioned is doing all this ‘*for his sake*’; and what is meant is that
the man becomes absolved, if when, on his property being taken away by
robbers, the Brāhmaṇa becomes stupefied and proceeds to commit
suicide,—or when he is fighting unaided against the robbers,—if the man
comes forward and pays to him the equivalent of what he has lost, and
consoles him with such words as—‘do not commit suicide, I am giving you
this much wealth.’—(80)

This text sets forth the last alternative.

‘*Having confessed his guilt*,’ his offence—‘before the Congregation *of
the Gods of Earth*—Brāhmaṇas—‘*and the Gods of men*’—Kṣatriyas;—the
‘Brāhmaṇa’ meant here are the *priests* officiating at a sacrifice, and
the ‘*Kṣatriya*’ for the *sacrificer*.—Having done this, ‘*if he bathes
at the Final Bath of the Horse-sacrifice*’ that has been performed,—‘*he
becomes absolved*.’

Some people think that, inasmuch as the treatment of the ‘Twelve-year
penance’ has been finished, what is set forth in the present verse is a
distinct alternative to it.

Others, however, hold that, inasmuch as alternatives have already been
mentioned in the course of the description of the Twelve-year Penance
itself, the present verse must be taken as laying down the final point
of that same penance,—just in the same way as ‘dying for the sake of the
cow or the Brāhmaṇa’ has been laid down;—this final point resembling the
‘rising’ either after the performance of the ‘Sārasvata’ sacrifice, or
on reaching a water-fall.

Our view, however, is that—(1) since the former penance has already been
summed up, the present one may be taken as a distinct alternative, while
(2) on account of its occurring in the middle of the treatment of the
former penance, it may be taken as forming part of it So that it may be
taken as both,—it being efficacious when performed along with the
Twelve-year Penance, as also when performed by itself alone, according
to the circumstances attending each case.—(82)

</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This goes on to describe the necessity of men liable to expiation
presenting themselves before the Congregation or Court; and the
definition of this ‘Court’ is that—‘the Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda
constitute the Court.’

“It is declared (under 12.110) that the ‘Court should consist of *at
least ten men*,’ or again (12.113)—‘a single person learned in the
Veda.’”

The number ‘ten’ mentioned in the former text does not refer to the
*men*; it refers to their *qualifications*; since in the verse following
we find the qualifications enumerated—‘knowing the three Vedas, a
logician, an exegetist etc., etc.’ (12.111). As regards the ‘single
person learned in the Veda’ (12.113),—what this shows is that, even in
the absence of the other qualifications—of being a logician and so
forth,—if a man possesses the one qualification of *knowing the Veda*,
he becomes qualified for serving on the ‘Court’

The present verse is meant to lay down the exact *number* of men
constituting the ‘Court’ And even though the only qualification
mentioned here is ‘knowledge of the Veda’ yet the others—being a
logician and so forth,—are also understood. As otherwise mere ‘knowledge
of the Veda’ could not be accepted as a definition of the ‘Court.’ All
this we shall explain later on (under XII).

“If Vedic learning is not possible without the knowledge of Logic,
Exegetics and the rest, wherefore has it been said that ‘even a single
man *learned in the Veda* may make up the Court?’”

All that this latter declaration means is that, even in the absence of
all other qualifications, *Vedic learning* alone by itself would
constitute a sufficient qualification. All this we shall explain in
connection with the text in question.

From all this it follows that when a man has incurred the liability to
perform an expiation, he should question three men assembled together;
as a single man is liable to make mistakes or become careles.

This recourse to the ‘Court’ must be taken even by persons who may be
themselves learned; and the reason for this is that—‘*the word of corned
men is purificatory*.’

Nor would this make ‘secret expiation’ impossible. Because in that case
the offence would not be known to any person; and appearing before the
Court is necessary only in cases where the offence has become known. It
is what has been spoken of above (22)—‘By confession, by repentance etc,
etc.’

This explanation, however, is not right What the present verse refers to
is the case where, in the absence of the requisite expiation not having
been clearly laid down, it becomes necessary to assume the right
expiation, ‘on the basis of the man’s capacity, and the nature of the
offence’ (209); and the meaning of the text is that that *assumption* is
to be accepted which is made by three men.—(85)

‘*Removes*’—destroys.

‘*On account of his being self-possessed*’—*i.e*., by reason of his

fact a man is called ‘*self-possessed*’ when he has full faith in what
is prescribed in the scriptures; this man’s firm conviction is that what

‘*Embryo*’—belonging to the *Brāhmaṇa* caste.

The meaning of the verse is that one should not help an abortion.

‘*Unknown*’—whose male or female sex is not yet ascertainable. When this
has become ascertainable, the expiation shall be in accordance with the
sex.

“How can there be a killing of the *embryo*, until the woman is also
killed?”

Abortions are generally secured by the use of medicines and such other
methods.

‘*This same penance*.’—They say that, since the singular number is used
here, it is the ‘Twelve-year Penance’ that is meant here; specially as
this is what has been spoken of in closest proximity to the present
text.

Others, however, have held that the term ‘*this same*’ refers to the
means of purification in general; hence it stands for all the expiatory
rites that have been laid down in connection with ‘Brāhmaṇa-killing.’

‘*A Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya who has performed sacrifices*—*i.e*., who is
engaged in a sacrificial performance;—no significance attaching to the
past tense (in *ijānau*’); as in another *Smṛti* text we read—‘The
Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya seated at the Extraction of Soma’; from which it
would seem that the rule here laid down refers to the persons who have
started the drinking of Soma, and not to those engaged in the
performance of the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices. But the clear
implication of the Vedic text is that it applies to persons engaged in
any sort of sacrificial performance;—the actual text being ‘it is only
when one has become a *Brāhmaṇa* that he engages *in a sacrifice*’
\[where no particular sacrifice is specified\].

‘A *woman qf the Ātreyī race*.’—Woman born in the race of Atri. The
caste of the man and the woman being the same, what is prescribed in
connection with the killing of ‘a Brāhmaṇa’ should apply equally to the
case of the male and the female; hence the mention of ‘the woman of the
Ātreyī race’ clearly excludes women of the other races; which means that
the killing of these other women of other Brāhmaṇa races, would be only
a ‘minor offence,’ mentioned above as ‘the killing of a woman of a
Vaiśya or a Kṣatriya’ (66). What has been spoken of as ‘the killing of a
woman or of a friend eta, eta,’ refers to women of all the four castes.
The upshot of all this is—that in the case of the killing of a Brāhmaṇa
woman, there are two optional alternatives—the expiation laid down for
‘heinous offences’ and that prescribed for a ‘minor offence’; which one
of the two is to be adopted bring determined by the qualifications of
the husband or of the woman herself,—as also by the intentional or
unintentional character of the crime. For instance, (*a*) even in the
case of a woman of another caste, if she has a child still at her
breast, the expiation shall be of the heavier kind, in consideration of
the fact, that it would be difficult for the child to live after the
mother’s death;—(*b*) in the case of the Brāhmaṇa woman who, faultless
herself, has become an object of hatred to her husband, and is killed by
a man because, on being approached by him, she preserves her chastity
and does not accede to his proposal,—the expiation shall be of the
heavier kind;—as also (*c*) in the case of recklessly killing a friend’s
wife. In other cases on the other hand, ordinary expiation according to
Verse 66 would be applicable In the case of the woman of the ‘*Ātreyī*’
race, however, there are no alternatives.

Others have explained the word ‘*Ātreyī*’ to mean a *woman in her
courses*, on the strength of its occurring along with the term
‘*embryo*.’ They quote the text —‘*pātyate bhrūṇahā, ātreyyāśca
hantā*’—where the term ‘*bhrūṇahā*’ means ‘the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa.’
Under this explanation also the *woman in her courses* referred to must
be a *Brāh* *maṇa*. She is called ‘*Ātreyi*’ in consideration of the
fact that she is sure to carry a child in her womb. Though the use of
the nominal affix found in the term ‘*Ātreyī*’ is nowhere laid down in
the sense here attributed to it, yet the said denotation may be accepted
on the strength of usage.—(87)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.251), according to which
‘*avijñāta garbha*’ indicates the stage of pregnancy before the sex of
the child has been determined;—it adds that though the fact of the child
in the womb belonging to the Brāhmaṇa-caste would make the offender
liable to the expiation for Brāhmaṇa-slaying,—yet, in as much as the
possibility of the child being female might lead one to think that the
guilt of killing a female would be a ‘minor sin,’ and hence involve a
lighter expiation,—it becomes necessary to emphasise the necessity of
performing the heavier expiation.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 87, 179 and 228), which adds
the explanation that, having killed the Brāhmaṇa embryo, *before its sex
has been determined*, one should perform the rites laid down in
connection with ‘Brāhmaṇa-murder,’ as also for killing a Kṣatriya or a
Vaiśya—while they are performing a sacrifice,—an d also for killing an
‘*ātreyī*,’ *i.e*., a Brāhmaṇī.

**(verses 11.87-88)  
**

*Gautama* (22.12-13).—‘The same penance that has been prescribed for
Brāhmaṇa-slaying shall be performed by one who has killed a Brāhmaṇa
female when she has bathed after her course; also for destroying the
embryo of a Brāhmaṇa, though its sex may be not distinguishable.’

*Bodhāyam* (2.1-12).—‘The penance for killing a woman who has bathed
after her courses is the same as that for the killing of a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Āpastamba* (1.24.8-9).—‘He who has destroyed an embryo of a Brāhmaṇa,
or a woman during her courses, is called *Abhiśasta*, accursed, and
stands on the same footing regarding expiation, as the Brāhmaṇa-killer.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.23, 34-35).—‘He is called *Bhrūṇahan* who kills a
Brāhmaṇa or destroys an embryo the sex of which is unknown. For killing
a female of the Brāhmaṇa caste who is an *Ātreyī*...... the same penance
that is prescribed for the Brāhmaṇa-killer should be performed. That
woman is called *Ātreyī* who has bathed after her courses.’

*Viṣṇu* (50.8-10).—‘He who has killed a pregnant woman, or a woman in
her courses, or a woman who has bathed after her courses, or a friend,
shall perform the *Mahāvrata*.’ (p. 839)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.251).—‘He who destroys an embryo or an *Ātreyī* woman
should perform the penance laid down for the Brāhmaṇa-killer.’

The expiation here laid down pertains to giving false evidence in
connection with gold, land and such things, or in cases of doubt
regarding a murder. The guilt in these cases is very much heavier; and
in regard to other expiations laid down elsewhere, the adoption of one
or the other should be determined in accordance with the gravity or
otherwise of the

‘*Angering*.’—This is the same as what has been spoken of as ‘falsely
harassing’ under 56 above; as ‘harassment’ is always preceded by
‘angering.’

‘*Trust*.’—In this case also the exact nature of the expiation shall
depend upon such considerations as to whether the trust-property belongs
to a poor or to a rich person, to a low person or to a Brāhmaṇa, or to
some other person of high position. In a case where only one expiation
is mentioned, it can be one only; and there can be no occasion for any
assumptions. In fact, in connection with giving false evidence and
‘misappropriating a trust’ there are no varying grades of expiation.

What is prescribed in connection with ‘wine-drinking’ is certainly
somewhat heavier; but every case is to be determined in accordance with
‘the capacity etc.,’ of the guilty person (11.209); though these
considerations have been laid down only as affecting those offences ‘for
the expiation whereof no atonement has been prescribed’ (209).—(88)

notes:—This refers to cases where the false evidence leads to the death

the deposit placed by a Brāhmaṇa,—‘*strī*’ here stands for the wife of a
person who has taken the fires, who is endowed with the quality of being
devoted to her husband and so forth;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.
179);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 56b).

‘*Killed*’—murdered.

This verse has been already explained above as meant to indicate that
the expiation for *intentional ‘Brāhmaṇa-* killing’ should be very
heavy.—(89)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Iyam*’.—According to some this refers to [verse
72],
and these people hold that “in the case of wilful murder the penance has
to be made severer by doubling or trebling the term of twelve
years.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.226), where it is put forward (by
the Pūrvapakṣin) in support of the view that in the case of *wilful*
murder there is no expiation at all;—but the *Siddhānta* view is that
‘*iyam*’ refers to the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance mentioned before (verse
72), and the latter half of the verse does not entirely deny all
expiation; since several texts have definitely prescribed *expiation* by
death in such cases.—It is quoted again under 3.243, in support of the
view that the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance is meant to meet cases of
unintentional murder;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 77);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 2a);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 354), which
says that this precludes only the ‘Twelve Years Penance,’ and not all
kinds of expiation, as *suicide* is actually laid down as the expiation
for intentional Brāhmaṇa-murder;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 65),
wḥich says that the meaning is that the ‘Twelve Years’ and other
penances are precluded from intentional Brāhmaṇa-murder, and the
implication is that there is no expiation for it.

Though the text speaks of ‘*twice-born men*,’ yet what is said here is
meant for the Brāhmaṇa only; says another Smṛti text—‘Hot wine should be
poured on the Brāhmaṇa’ (*Gautama*, 23.1).

‘*Through folly*’—this is only explanatory.

‘*Red hot*’— Though the text uses the word ‘*varṇa*’ *colour*, yet it is
mere *heat* that is meant; as is clear from what follows, about ‘*the

</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The liquor Here meant is that distilled from ground grains, according to
Medhātithi, Govindarāja And Kullūka;—according to Nārāyaṇa the
death-penance is meant for all twice-born men partaking of liquor
distilled from grains, and by Brāhmaṇas who have drunk any of the three
kinds of liquor described under verse 95.

‘*Mohāt*’.—Nandana reads ‘*amohāt*’ and explains it as ‘not
unintentionally’, ‘intentionally.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), which explains ‘*mohāt*’ as
meaning ‘ignorance of scriptural injunctions’.—It enters into a long
discussion regarding the exact connotation in the present context, of
the term ‘*surā*,’ and comes to the conclusion that it stands for the
liquor distilled from ground grains; the partaking of which is equally
heinous for all the three higher castes,—the drinking of the other two
kinds, that distilled from molasses and that from honey, being sinful
for the Brāhmaṇa only.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 815), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Mohāt*’ stands for ‘ignorance of the scriptures,’ and not for
‘ignorance of the nature of the liquid drunk’;—‘*agnivarṇām*,’ ‘heated
to the extent of becoming red-hot’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta
9a);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 93), which explains ‘*agnivarṇām*’
as ‘hot as fire,’ and quotes Jikana to the effect that ‘*mohāt*’ means
‘intentionally.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.48).

*Gautama* (23.1).—‘They shall pour hot wine into the mouth of a Brāhmaṇa
who has drunk wine; he will be purified by death.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.18, 19, 21).—‘If he has drunk *Surā* he shall scald
himself to death with hot wine. For unintentionally drinking *Surā*, he
shall perform the *Kṛcchra* penances during three months and then
undergo a second initiation. They quote the following—“A Brāhmaṇa, a
Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya who has unintentionally drunk the wine called
*Vāruṇī* must be initiated a second time.”’

*Āpastamba* (1.25.3).—‘A wine-drinker has to drink exceedingly hot
liquor, so that he dies.’

*Vaśiṣtha* (20-19, 22).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa intentionally drinks liquor other
than *Surā*, or if he unintentionally drinks *Surā*, he must perform a
*Kṛcchra* and an *Atikṛcchra*; and after eating clarified butter, be
initiated again. But a Brāhmaṇa who repeatedly partakes of *Surā* shall
drink liquor of the same kind boiling hot. He becomes pure by death.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.253-256).—‘The man who drinks *Surā* attains purity by
dying after drinking any one of the following things red-hot—*Surā*,
water, clarified butter, cow’s urine and milk. Or he may perform the
penance prescribed for Brāhmaṇa-killing, clothed in hair-cloth and
wearing matted looks; or for one year he may use sesamum oil-cake or
grains of rice at night only. If any one of the three castes unknowingly
drinks the *Vāruṇī* wine, ho shall undergo initiation a second time. The
Brāhmaṇa woman who drinks wine does not go to her husband’s regions; and
in the world she is born as a bitch.’

*Viṣṇu* (51-1).—‘A drinker of wine must abstain from all religious rites
and subsist on grains unseparated from the husk for one year.’

In the case of any one of these expiations, the epithet ‘red-hot’ is to
be applied.

The cow’s urine and other substances have been specified with a view to
predude dying by any other means.

In the present case, the ‘wine’ should be understood as standing for
that liquor which is obtained from grains; as it is this liquor to which
the term ‘wine’ is held to be directly applicable; its application to
other liquors being indirect What is said here is applicable to cases of
*intentional* wine-drinking; sis it is going to be declared later on
(11.146)—“If one drinks wine unintentionally, he becomes purified by
going through the sacramental rites.’

‘*Agnivarna*,’ ‘*red-hot*,’ means that it should be *as hot as fire*; as
is clear from the phrase ‘*until he dies*.’

Wine is forbidden for women also. It has been declared in the work of
Vaśiṣṭha that—‘If a Brāhmaṇa woman drinks wine, the gods do not permit
her to go to the regions where her husband has gone; she roams about in
this world, and after all her merit has been exhausted, she becomes an
amphibious animal.’—(91)

This expiation is meant for those cases where wine is taken as medicine
when life is in actual danger;—though winedrinking in such circumstances
has been permitted by certain texts.

In connection with the case where wine has been drunk unintentionally,
it is going to be laid down that the man should pass through the
sacramental rites over again, and also perform the ‘*Taptakṛcchra*’
penance.

Others take this verse to apply to the case of the drinking of the
‘*Gauḍī*’ and ‘*Mādhvī*’ liquors; as another *Smṛti* text has declared
that—‘For drinking wine other than that got from grains, one should
perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance.’

‘*Once*.’—This applies both to ‘pieces of grain’ and ‘oilcake’;—‘*at
night*.’

‘*Hair-cloth*’—cloth made of the hair of the cow or the goat.

‘*With his hair matted*’—only at the top—or over the whole head.

‘*With a sign*’—such as a keg of wine and so forth.—(92)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.254), which adds that this refers
to a case where wine has been drunk by mistake and then vomitted;—again,
as referring to a case where the, wine has been taken unitentionally but
thrown out, after it has merely touched the palate.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 412), to the same
effect,—*i.e*. as referring to a case where the wine has only touched
the palate;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 9b);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 98), which says that this refers either to cases
of *unintentional* but repeated drinking of the *Gauḍī* and *Mādhvī*
wines, or to those of *intentional* drinking, only once, of those wines.

Though the term ‘*anna*’ denotes literally ‘*what is eaten*,’ *food*,
yet it is more commonly applied to the *Vrīhi* and other *grains*, as
also to cooked rice, fried flour, cakes and so forth. It is on this
basis that Pāṇini (2.1.34) has made a distinction between ‘*anna*’ and
‘*vyañjana*.’

Thus then, inasmuch as wine is obtained from grains, it becomes liable
to be spoken of as ‘*anna*,’ ‘*grain*,’ and it comes to be spoken of as
‘*the dirty refuse of grains*.’ This description of wine is indicative
of the fact that its use is forbidden. And this indication applies to
all the three higher castes:—that the wine extracted from grains should
not be drunk by the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya or the Vaiśya. Then again it
is this wine extracted from grains to which the name is applicable more
directly than to the other two varieties, the *Gauḍī* and the *Mādhvī*.
Further, the expiation in the case of other distilled liquors is not so
heavy as in the case of the *Sīdhu* (*i.e*., the *Gauḍī*) and the
*Mādhvī*.

‘*Sin also is called* *dirt*,’—this has been added with a view to
indicate that wine is a most despicable thing.

Though the subject-matter of the present context is Expiation, yet the
Syntactical Indication of the present verse clearly points to the
*prohibition* of wine. And since it is a distinct sentence, it cannot be
regarded as a mere declamation.—(93)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika p. 548);—in *Aparārka*
(p. 1044), which adds the following notes:—‘Being the refuse of grains’
is applicable only to that liquor which is distilled from ground grains,
and not to those distilled from molasses and honey, as neither of these
two latter is ‘grain,’ which name is applicable only to *Vrīhi* and
other corns; thus then the drinking of liquor distilled from grains is
forbidden for all twice-born men, and the other two kinds for the
Brāhmaṇa only.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), firstly to the effect that ‘*Surā*’
is the name of that liquor which is distilled from grains;—secondly to
the effect that this liquor is forbidden for all ‘the three higher
castes, while that distilled from honey or molasses is forbidden for the
Brāhmaṇa only;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 89), which adds that
‘*annānām*’ stands not only for *rice*, but for barley, wheat and other
grains also,—hence it is that the wine produced by the fermentation of
grains is called ‘*Surā*—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 355), to the
effect that the name ‘*Surā*’ d irectly denotes wine made from grains
only.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Gauḍī*’ is that which is distilled from ‘*Guḍa*,’ molasses. Even
according to those persons who make wine directly from fermented
cane-juice itself, the article distilled is ‘*Gauḍī*’ ‘distilled from
*guḍa*,’ in the sense that the name of the *product*, (*guḍa*, molasses)
is applied to the cause (cane-juice).

The ‘*Mādhvī*’ is that ‘distilled from *madhu*, *grape-juice* i.e., in
its fermented form’; for fresh grape-juice, before it has become
fermented into wine, is not forbidden. This distinctly lays down that it
is the *fermented* grape-juice that is called ‘*Mādhvī*.’ Wherever the
prohibition contains the word ‘*madya*’ (‘intoxicating substance’), it
cannot apply to any substance which has not acquired intoxicating
properties; us such a substance could not be spoken of as ‘*madya*,’
intoxicating substance. A similar case is that of the word ‘*Śukta*’
(‘fermented gruel’) which is applied to the gruel in a certain
condition, and not to gruel in general. So long as the gruel has not
become soured, it is not called ‘*Śukta*.’ In the same manner again, the
calf is not called a ‘bull’ while it is young.

Thus it is that the mixture of grain water and other things does not
come to be called ‘wine,’ so long as it does not imbibe intoxicating
properties, by being kept over night Similarly with cane-juice,
grape-juice and other substances.

“From all this it would follow that the drinking of a small quantity of
wine is permitted—that quantity of it which, if drunk, does not cause
intoxication, or when this is prevented by the use of an antidote.”

There is no force in this objection. The prohibition is not meant to
apply to the bringing about of intoxication; it does not mean, for
instance, that ‘one should act so that he does not become intoxicated or
drunk’; what the prohibition means is that ‘one should not drink that
which possesses the capacity to cause intoxication’; and this capacity
is present in a small quantity of wine also. The mere fact that while
dry and low-spirited wine inebriates even when drunk in small
quantities, that which is soft and high-spirited does not do so even
when drunk in large quantities,—does not prove that there is no
intoxicating power in the latter. Mere absence of effects does not
necessarily prove the absence of the causa For instance, because a
certain quantity of fire is unable to burn a large piece of wood, that
does not prove that the fire does not possess the power to burn;
specially when it is found that it is quite capable of burning dry
grass.

It has been argued that—“it would seem that the drinking of wine is
permitted if its intoxicating properties are counteracted by an
antidote.”

But there is no force in this objection either. For even though the fire
may not burn a heap of grass when it is wet, it does not mean that it
does not possess the power to burn; all that it indicates is that though
the power is there, it is unable to produce its effect But so long as
the power is there, the chance of the effect being produced is always
there.

Then again, no other substance could deprive the wine of its inherent
power of intoxicating; all that it can do is to prevent the effects from
appearing. Thus it is that a man of bilious temperament becomes
intoxicated by the use of even a small quantity of wine, another man of
phlegmatic temperament is not so easily intoxicated. From all this it is
clear that the power is not destroyed in either case.

Thus then the prohibition cannot apply to the substance which is yet to
acquire the intoxicating power. Nor can it be regarded as forbidden
simply because there is prohibition of it as possessing certain definite
characteristics. For instance, in the case of the assertion—‘the thief
should be avoided’ (it is not meant that every man, even before he has
committed theft, shall be avoided). It is for this reason that no
prohibition applies to the gruel before it has become sour.

“How do you explain the form ‘*Mādhvī*’? The correct form should be
‘*Mādhavī*.’”

The answer to this is that rules as applied to proper names are not
compulsory (*Paribhāṣā*, 95); and the authority for this consists of
Pāṇini’s Sūtra 3.4.146.

The use of the term ‘*chief of the twice-born*’ has been used with a
view to permit wine-drinking for the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya. For
instance, the Mahābhārata describes wine as drunk by the Yadāvas and the
Bhāratas:—‘Both Keśava and Arjuna were found by me to be drunk with
wine,’—which is a declamatory assertion pointing to the same fact “Why
is then the plural form in ‘*so all*?’”

Two of them are the substances *likened* and one is that to which those
are likened.

The mention of wine being the ‘dirty refuse of grains’ is meant to be a
declamatory assertion producing a reason for what has been prescribed;
just as in the case of the text ‘*Śūrpeṇa juhoti tena hi annam
kriyate*.’—(94)

‘*Madhvī*.’—distilled from honey’ (Medhātithi);—‘distilled from Madhūka
flowers’ (Kullūka);—‘distilled either from grapes and from Madhūka
flowers or from honey’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1044), which adds that the liquor
distilled from grains is here made an example of prohibited drink; which
means that this is the principal kind of liquor, and the other two are
only secondary; it is for this reason that though all the three are
equally forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa, the former alone is forbidden for
the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), to the effect that liquor distilled
from grains is the principal kind of liquor;—and again, in the sense
that the sin involved in the drinking of liquor distilled from honey and
molasses is as heavy as that in drinking that distilled from grains.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 411), which notes
that the name ‘*Surā*’ is applied primarily to liquor distilled from
grains only, and only indirectly to those distilled from honey and
molasses;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 548);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
814), which notes that ‘*dvijottama*’ stands for Brāhmaṇas; hence the
meaning is that all kinds of liquor are forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa from
his very birth;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 89) in support of the view
that the name ‘*Surā*’ applies to wines of all the three kinds;—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 355) to the effect that the name ‘*Surā*’ applies
directly to these three kinds of wine only, and only figuratively to
other kinds.

*Viṣṇu* (22.82).—‘Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of
*Madhūka*, or from flour; these three kinds of wine have to be
discerned; as the one so all; none of them should be tasted by the
twice-born. Further, that distilled from the blossoms of the *Madhūka*,
from molasses, from the *Ṭaṅka* fruit, from the Jujube fruit, from
dates, from the bread-fruit, from honey, *Maireya* wine, and wine made
of the sap of the cocoanut (coconut?) tree; these ten intoxicating
drinks are unclean for the Brāhmaṇa; but the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya
commit no wrong in touching or drinking them.’

*Agastya* (Aparārka, p. 1070).—‘That distilled from the jack-fruit, from
grapes, from *Madhūka* blossoms, from dates, from palm-fruit, from

‘*Yakṣa*’ and the rest are lower classes of beings, ignorant of the law
relating to what should and what should not be eaten; and it is they
that eat meat

The compound ‘*Surāsavam*,’ is a copulative one, *i.e*., in accordance
with Pāṇini 2.4.6.

‘*Distilled liquor*’ also is a kind of ‘*intoxicant*,’ there being a
slight difference between the two. The two are mentioned on the analogy
of such expressions as ‘the ox and the bull’

‘*Who partake of the offering to the gods*’—The cake, rice and such
substance offered to the gods are called ‘*offerings*’; as mentioned in
connection with the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices. It is these
that it is right and proper for the Brāhmaṇa to eat, and not wine and
meat, which are the food of the lower spirits.—(95)

‘*Tumbling on unclean things*’ is purely declamatory, like the mention

“How can the reciting of Vedic texts ever be an *improper act?*”

The answer to this is that what is meant is that ‘he might do an act
which is improper,’ as compared to the reciting of the Veda. Further,
why is it impossible for the reciting of Veda to be ‘improper?’ In fact
the uttering of Vedic texts has been clearly forbidden for one who is in
an unclean condition.—(96)

‘*Punish me*.’—‘Inflict the proper punishment on me.’ The man shall go

‘*Club*’—a particular kind of stick, made of iron or wood.

‘Once,’ ‘*himself*’—both of these are meant to be emphasised.

‘*Becomes purified by death*.’—The man shall be struck only; it does not
matter whether or not he dies by it; he becomes purified by the stroke
of the club.

‘*The Brāhmaṇa by penance*’—as described below. Here also stress is not
meant to be laid upon the term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*.’ It is for this reason that
the next verse contains the term ‘*twice-born person*’ (in general).

Though the stealing of *Kṛṣṇala* (grains of gold, used at certain
sacrifices) is a serious crime, yet, what is here laid down should be
understood as pertaining to the stealing of a hundred gold-pieces. It
has been explained that *punishment* and *expiation* proceed on the same
lines; and, in connection with punishments, it has been said that
‘*death* shall be the penalty when *more than a hundred* gold-pieces
have been stolen’ (8.321); hence the expiation here put forward should
also be taken as pertaining to the stealing of the same quantity.

As regards the assertion that the thief becomes pure by death, it is
understood to be based upon the passage—‘For him the King shall take up
a weapon made of Udumbara wood, and kill him with it, and he becomes
pure by that death.’ And this refers to a case where the stealer is a
Kṣatriya or one lower still, and the owner is a highly qualified person.

When, however, the man is prepared to die, he may be made to refund what
he has stolen and smeared with butter, live upon cow-dung (?).—(100)

‘*Tapasaiva tu*.’—“Kullūka thinks that it indicates that, while a
Brāhmaṇa must never be slain by the king, other Āryans also may perform
austerities.—According to Rāghavānanda it refers to the optional
recitation of the *Gāyatri* 700,000 times;—according to Nārāyaṇa to
other penances, even such as end in death;—Govindarāja takes it as
referring to those prescribed in the next verse.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 414), which
adds the following notes:—The alternative of ‘killing’ is meant for one
who is a Brāhmaṇa in name only while ‘austerity’ is for one who is
endowed with such qualities as being devoted to sacrifices and so forth.
It goes on to add that the death-penalty is meant for cases of
intentional stealing; *unintentional* stealing of gold being possible in
cases where a man steals a piece of cloth, to which (unknown to him) a
piece of gold may be tied. It adds that the particular ‘austerity’ is,
meant as described by Manu himself in the next verse.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1079), which adds that the term
‘*vipraḥ*’ does not preclude the other castes; it is emphasised only
with a view to indicate that what is here stated is an exception to the
general prohibition ‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not he killed this general
prohibition is of that act of killing to which one is prompted by mere
passion; in the case in question the killing is done as an act of
justice, and at the request of the culprit himself. In fact the omission
of this act of justice would involve the king in sin.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.267), which adds the following note—On
being struck once, if the culprit dies, he becomes absolved from his
sin; but even if he do not die when struck, he becomes absolved from the
sin;—and again, to the effect that, the killing of the Brāhmaṇa under
the said circumstances is permissible;—and in *Prayaścittaviveka* (p.
117).

“According to Nārāyaṇa this verse refers to an unintentional offence;
according to Kullūka and Rāghvānanda, to the theft of a small
sum.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 415), as
describing the ‘austerity’ mentioned in the preceding verse;—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 1080), which remarks that this refers to a case where the
gold stolen belonged to a Brāhmaṇa devoid of good qualities, or where
the theft has been committed by a Brāhmaṇa possessing good qualities in
times of distress for the support of his family;—and that in a case
where one without qualities has stolen gold belonging; to a Brāhmaṇa
with good qualities, in large quantities, or for such evil purposes as
gambling and the like, the expiation must be one that ends in the
culprit’s death.

‘*He who has violated his preceptor’s bed*’—Another reading his
‘*Gurutalpī*’;—the term ‘*talpī*’ ending in the possessive affix, stands
for a particular form of intercourse between man and woman.

By ‘*preceptor*,’ here is meant the Preceptor as well as the Father. And
‘*bed*’ stands for the *wife*.

The expiation here laid down is for intercourse with the wife of one’s
preceptor, or with a step-mother of the same caste; and the three
expiations here set forth refer to a case where the act has been
intentional.

‘*Confess his guilt*’— proclaim his crime.

He shall lie down upon a bed of iron as hot as fire; that this is what
is meant is dear by the next sentence—‘*He becomes purified by death*.’

‘*Sūrmi*’ is image of a woman, made of iron. This he shall
embrace.—(103)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 1083), which adds the following
notes:—The culprit should openly proclaim his offence of having violated
his Guru’s bed;—‘*sūrmī*’ is a female image made of iron or some such
metal.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 255);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 836 and 837), which notes that there are two
expiations prescribed here:—(*a*) lying down upon a heated iron-bed, and
(*b*) embracing the red hot image;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 11
*a*);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 137), which explains ‘*gurutalpaḥ*’
(which is its reading for ‘*gurutalpī*’) as ‘*guroḥ talpam talpam
yasya*,’ ‘*sūrmī*’ as an iron image.

*Gautama* (23.8-11).—‘He who has defiled his *Guru’s* bed shall lay
himself down on a heated iron-bed; or he shall embrace the red-hot
iron-image of a woman; or he shall tear out his organ and testicles and,
holding them in his hands, walk straight towards the south-west, until
he falls down dead. He will be purified after death.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.13-15).—‘He who has defiled his Guru’s bed shall lay
himself down on a heated iron bed;—or embrace the red-hot image of a
woman;—or cutting off his organ together with the testicles, and holding
them in his joined hands, he shall walk towards the south-west until he
falls down dead.’

*Āpastamba* (1.25.1-2).—‘He who has had connection with his *Guru’s*
wife shall cut off his organ together with the testicles, take them in
his joined hands and walk towards the south until he falls down dead. Or
he may die embracing a heated metal-image of a woman.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (22.13-14).—‘He who violates his *Guru’s* bed shall, cut off
his organ together with the testicles, take them in his joined hands and
walk towards the south; whenever he meets with an obstacle, there he
shall stand until he dies;—or having shaved all his hair and smeared his
body with clarified butter, he shall embrace the heated iron-image of a
woman. It is declared in the Veda that he is purified after death.’

*Viṣṇu* (34.1, 2;—53.1).—‘Sexual connection with one’s mother or
daughter or daughter-in-law is crime of the highest degree. Such
criminals of the highest degree should enter the flames; there is no
other way to atone for the crime. One who has had illicit sexual
intercourse must perform the *Prājāpatya* penance for one year according
to the rule of the *Mahāvrata*.’ (P. 839)

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.50-51).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.259-260).—‘The violator of his *Guru’s* bed should he
down on a heated iron-bed along with the iron-image of a woman; or
cutting out his testicles and holding them he shall give up his body
towards the south; or he shall perform the *Prājāpatya* penance for one
year, or the *Cāndrāyaṇa* for three months, and shall repeat the Vedic
text.’

The ‘cutting off’ here mentioned is conducive to purification. The use
of a cutting instrument is implied by the fact that every act needs the
requisite implements; so that the weapon implied must be one that is fit
to be used for the required *cutting*.

The South-west is the ‘*region of evil spirits*.’

‘*Straight on*,’—not deviating from the straight line; so that he may
not seek to avoid wells or pits and such things; but in the case of
walls and such obstacles, he should certainly go round them.—(104)

This expiation refers to a case where the crime has been committed
unintentionally, under the misapprehension that the woman was the man’s
own wife;—or when the crime is intentional, and the woman belongs to a
different caste.

‘*Rags*,’ ‘*cīra*,’—pieces of doth.

‘*With beard grown*’—letting his beard grow.

Even in a case where the woman is of the same caste, if she is an
unchaste woman, the expiation shall be a light one.—(105)

‘*Cow-killer*’—one who has killed a cow; the word being formed with the
‘*Ka*’ affix.

‘*Shall drink barley*.’—Some people explain this to mean a drink mixed
with barley. Others, however, hold that the name of the original
substance (barley) has been used in the sense of its product; hence what
is meant is that the man shall drink *barley-gruel*.

In the ease of the former explanation, it is necessary to assume the
addition of water or some liquid substance, without its being mentioned
in the text; as mere barley-grains cannot be drunk, until they are mixed
up with a liquid substance.

In the second explanation, however, all that is necessary is to take the
word ‘barley’ in a figurative sense; and certainly, a figurative or
indirect signification is much simpler than the assumption of what is
not mentioned at all.

‘*Having shaved his head*’—with his hair shaved off; or it may simply
mean *with his hairs cut*.

‘*Cow-pen*’—the place where cows sit and rest.

‘*Covered with the skin of the cow*’—not necessarily of the cow that has
been killed; it may be of another cow also.—(108)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

**(verses 11.108-116)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 191),
which adds that this refers to the ease of intentionally killing a cow
belonging to a Brāhmaṇa;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 860), which notes that
what is laid down in verses 108 to 113 refers to cases of intentional
killing of a cow belonging to the Kṣatriya, and what is declared in
verses 115 and 116 to cases of killing any cow belonging to a Brāhmaṇa.
It goes on to add the following notes:—Since the text mentions no other
food, the man should live upon fruits and roots only; or the meaning may
be that ‘*anena vidhinā*’ (of verse 115) refers to the two months’
course detailed in the foregoing verses; and the sense is that the man
who is unable to give ten cows with a bull should give away all his
belongings. When however one unintentionally kills a cow, young and
well-fed, belonging to a Brāhmaṇa, he should observe the *three-monthly*
penance prescribed by Aṅgiras.

They are quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 519);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
358);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 196-197), which says that this
refers to the ordinary killing of the cow, and *not* to its killing for
sacrifices;—and adds the following explanation:—He should shave his
head, cover himself with the skin of the cow he has killed, and drink
gruel of barley cooked in cow’s urine’, and thus live in the cow-pen,
for one month, and during the next two months he should fast during the
day and eat a little in the evening,—‘*vīrāsana*’ is sitting without any
support,—‘*abhiśasta*’ attacked,—‘*bhayaih*’ by dangerous
animals,—‘*sarvaprāṇaiḥ*’ (which is its reading for *sarvapāpaiḥ*’), to
the best of his power—‘*gām na kathayet*’, with a view to have her
driven away,—‘*sucaritavrataḥ*’, he who has followed these restrictions
in the right manner,—he should give ten cows along with one bull.

Verse 115 only is quoted in the *Śuddhikaumdī* (p.241).

**(verses 11.108-116)  
**

*Gautama* (22.18).—‘The penance for killing a cow is the same as that
for killing a Vaiśya (vow of continence to be kept for three years and
giving one cow and one bull).’

*Āpastamba* (1.26, 1).—‘If a milch cow or a full-grown ox has been
killed without reason, the expiation shall be the same as that for
killing a Śūdra (give ten cows with a bull).’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21.18).—‘If he kills a cow, he shall perform, during six
months, a *Kṛcchra* or a *Taptakṛcchra*, clothed in the raw hide of that
cow.’

*Viṣṇu* (50, 16-24).—‘The man shall serve cows for a month, his hair and
beard having been shaven;—he shall sit down to rest when they rest; and
stand still when they stand still;—he shall give assistance to a cow
that has met with an accident;—and shall preserve cows from dangers;—he
shall not shelter himself against cold and similar dangers, without
having previously protected the cows against them;—he shall wash himself
with cow’s urine; and subsist upon the five bovine products;—this is the
*Go-vrata*, cow-penance, which must be performed by one who has killed a
cow.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.264-265).—‘The man who has killed a cow shall drink the
five bovine products for a month, sleeping in the cowpen, serving the
cows; and then by giving a cow, he becomes pure; or he shall calmly
perform the penance of *Prājāpatya Atikṛcchra*;—or having fasted for
three days, he shall give away ten cows with a hull as the eleventh.’

*Parāśara* (8.31-42).—‘Having shaved the whole head, he shall bathe
three times during the day, and live among cows during the night, and go
behind them during the day; when it is hot, or raining, or very cold or
when the wind is blowing strongly, he shall not protect himself until he
has protected the cows to the best of his ability. If he finds a cow
grazing in a field or in a threshing yarn—either his own or belonging to
some one else,—he shall not tell of it to any one; nor shall he tell any
one when he finds a calf sucking milk. He shall drink water when the
cows drink it, he down when they he down, and with all his strength
shall save a cow when she has either fallen down or stuck in mud. One
shall prescribe as penance for cow-killing a suitable *Prājāpatya* and
*Kṛcchra*: (Forms of these penances)—For one day he shall eat once; for
one day he shall eat only in the evening; for one day he shall eat only
what he gets without asking for it; and for one day he shall live on
air; for two days he shall eat only once; for two days he shall eat what
he gets without asking for it, for two days he shall eat only at night;
for two days he shall live on air. Each of these being done for three
days; and for four days. The prescribed penance having been performed,
he shall feed Brāhmaṇas, present them with fees and recite the sacred
texts. After feeding the Brāhmaṇas, the cow-killer becomes purified
without doubt.’

‘*For two months*’—he shall take his food once and then again only in
the evening of the next day.

If we take the term ‘*Kṣāra*’—‘*pungent*’—as a qualification of
‘*lavaṇa*,’ ‘salt,’ we secure the prohibition of the rock-salt also. If
the two terms were independent, the compound would be a copulative one,
and this would mean the prohibition of ‘pungent substances’ also; and in
that case it would be necessary to take the *singular* number as
indirectly indicating the *dual*; as we have the copulative compound
only, both the components are equally important at one and the same
time. When however, the compound is taken as a ‘qualitative’ one
(‘pungent’ being a qualification of the ‘salt’), we obtain a qualified
denotation.

‘*Limited*’—small; *i.e*., that which, without producing full
satisfaction, is enough to keep the body going.

‘*Bathing in cow’s urine*’ is to be done three times a day.

‘*At the fourth meal-time*’ is to be construed with ‘*for* *two
months*.’

In another Smṛti we read—‘Having shaved his head, covered with the skin,
he shall live in the cow-pen; end bathing in cow’s urine for two months
has been prescribed for him; it is only the washing of the feet that he
should do with water.’ In this it is not possible to connect the
*bathing in cow’s urine* with the phrase ‘*for two months*.’ The mention
of the *feet* is only for the purpose of filling up the metre; for, if
any impurity happens to attach to the man’s feet during the time that he
is bathing, it would naturally be washed with water only; as is clearly
laid down by the rules of purification. Hence at the time of bathing,
the rinsing of the mouth also should he done with water; at other times
purification may be secured by the use of clay and other cleansing
substances; and this would have to be done in the natural order—water
being used after clay has been applied. And since cow’s urine has been
prescribed for *bathing* only, what possibility would there be of its
being used for the rinsing of the mouth or any such purpose? In
connection with bathing, it is only as an expiation that the use of
cow’s urine has been prescribed.—(109)

When he is living in a cow-pen, he shall follow the cows that live in
that pen, when they go out to graze. The use of the pronoun ‘*those*’
implies that he should follow those cows in whose pen he is living;
specially as, if he were to go after other cows, this would not mean
constant ‘following.’

And while going along he shall inhale the dust raised by the cows.

Having wandered about with the cows, during the day, he should return to
the pen with them.

Having ‘*attended to them*’—served them by rubbing their bodies and
removed the dust from them; and ‘*having bowed to them*’—kneeling, and
with his head down;—‘*he shall rest in the Vīrāsana posture*.’ When one
rests, neither on a raised platform nor on a bedstead, but simply by
sitting down, it is called the ‘*Vīrāsana*’ *posture*.—(110)

‘*Sick*’—suffering from a disease.

‘*Threatened*’—caught up—‘*by danger*’ proceeding ‘*from thieves, tigers
and the like*.’

‘*Sarvaprāṇaiḥ*’—with all his strength. The word ‘*prāṇa*’ does not
always mean the *life-breath*; as we find such expressions ‘*alpaprāṇa*’
and ‘*mahāprāṇa*’ in the sense of *weak* and *strong* respectively.
Thus, when he is unable, by himself, to rescue her, he should bring
about bur rescue with the help of other men.—(112)

**(verses 11.115-116)**

He shall give ten cows and one bull.

He shall perform all the four penances, if he is capable of doing so.

If the said property is not available, he may give away all that he
possesses, even if this be less than the prescribed gift

‘*To persons learned in the Veda*’;—*i.e*, to several persons, not to
one or two only. In fact, this term itself has been added only with a
view to lay down *plurality*; since it is only *persons learned in the
Veda* who have been declared to be fit recipients for gifts.

In another *Smṛti* we read:—“If a cow happens to die through one’s
burning fire, carrying, tying, applying the rope-noose, or the
administration of some oil or medicine,—he shall shave his whole head,
perform the ‘*Prājāpatya*’ penance, and then give away a piece of
cloth.”

But this is an expiation for those cases where one does these acts
rather recklessly and hence his offence is due to negligence. Since we
find it laid down that—(*a*) ‘In tying or in medicating or in helping
her in calving, if one has taken all possible care and the cow dies,
there shall be no expiatory rite’; and (*b*) ‘If when one has
administered a medicine or oil or food to the cow or the Brāhmaṇa, and
death ensues, the man does not become tainted with guilt’ (*Saṃvarta*).

Another text lays down an expiation lasting for a month:—“He shall drink
the mixture of five products of the cow, and milk at the sixth
meal-time;—and at the end he shall satisfy the Brāhmaṇas with gifts and
give away sesamum and a cow.”

There is yet another, lasting for a fortnight:—“He shall eat only once,
fried flour, or barley-flour, or vegetables, or milk, or cards, or
butter.” The various articles mentioned here are so many optional
alternatives, as we shall explain later on; but the whole process is to
be carried through with the same substance with which it has been begun;
and one shall not eat fried flour on one day and barley-flour on the
other. For instance, even though ‘*Vrīhi*’ and ‘*Yava*’ have been laid
down as optional alternatives, yet, when once a performance has been
begun with *Vrīhi*, if it happens to run short in the middle, *Yava* is
used, only as a substitute; and it is with a substitute that the rite is
regarded as having been completed; in view of this deficiency in the
performance, the giving away of a cow has been prescribed. Thus then, in
the case in question also, the penances are as described, and if any
other optional alternative is adopted, a cow with calf should be given.

It has been asserted in Gautama’s work —‘*Gām vaiśyavat*’ (22.18)
\[which means that for killing a cow, one should perform the
Three-year-Penance and give away ten cows and a bull\]; and this rule of
Gautama’s pertains to the case where a Vedic scholar, learned in
sacrificial rituals and an *Agṇihotrin* kills a milch cow with a young
calf, belonging to a poor man. This same penance is to be done in its
‘one year’ form if the cow dies by chance, when the man, finding her in
a field or a garden eating corns, runs after her with a view to prevent
it, taking due care not to harm her. It is to be the
‘Three-year-Penance’ in the case of the intentional killing of a dry and
old cow belonging to one who is not a Vedic scholar. And the
‘*Prājāpatya*’ penance is to be performed in the case of the
unintentional killing of a cow devoid of all good points and belonging
to an owner devoid of all qualities; and in the case of the killing of a
similar cow intentionally, it is to be the
‘Three-year-Penance.’—(115-116)

‘*This same*’:—this means that the expiatory rites laid down for
*cow-killing* are applicable to all ‘minor offences.’ And the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ is another optional alternative.

Inasmuch as this latter rule has been laid down with special reference
to the *other* ‘*minor offences*’ some people hold that the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ does not apply to the case of the cow-killer.

But according to this view, it will be necessary to find out why the
*cow-killer* has been mentioned at all among ‘those who have committed
*minor offences*.’—(117)

celibacy,—*i.e*., sexual intercourse, an ‘immorality’; one who has done
this is ‘*avakīrṇī*,’ ‘the immoral religious student’

This is going to be described (under 120) as—‘the intentional emission
of semen.’

‘*One-eyed ass*’—This lays down the material to be used at the
sacrifice, along with its qualification.

‘*On the cross-way*.’—This lays down the place of the sacrifice.

‘*At night*.’—This lays down the time of the sacrifice.

‘*To Nirṛti*.’—This lays down the deity of the sacrifice.

‘*In* *the manner of the Pākayajña*.’—This prescribes the procedure to
be adopted at the sacrifice.

“As a matter of fact all *animal-sacrifices* have for their archetype
the *Agniṣṭoma*; as is clear from the fact that they can only be
accomplished by means of the animal-sacrifices at this latter
sacrifice—\[so that the said sacrifice of the ass must follow the
procedure of the Agnistoma, and not of the Pākayajña.\]”

True; but the same Agniṣṭoma is the archetype of the ‘Pākayajña’ also;
and it can be performed only when the agent is prompted by the desire
for those rewards that follow from that sacrifice. Then again, it has
been declared that ‘the animal also *flows*, and milk also flows’ \[so
that there is a distinct similarity between the Animal Sacrifice and the
Pākayajña offerings of milk\].

‘*Pākayajña*’— is a name applied to the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* and other
similar sacrifices.—(118)

**(verses 11.118-123)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (3.280).—‘The Student becomes an *Avakīrṇin* by
approaching a woman; he becomes purified by offering an ass to Nirṛti.’

*Viṣṇu* (37.35).—‘Criminals of the fourth degree shall perform the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* or *Parāka* penances, or shall sacrifice a cow.’

Do. (28.48-51).—‘A voluntary emission of semen by a twice-born youth
during the period of his studentship has been pronounced a transgression
of the rule prescribed for students. Having loaded himself with this
sin, he must go begging to seven houses, clothed only with the skin of
the cow, and proclaiming his deed; eating once only a meal consisting of
the alms received at those houses, and bathing three times, he becomes
absolved from guilt at the end of one year. After an involuntary
emission of semen during sleep, the twice-born student must bathe,
worship the sun and recite, three times, the mantra “Again shall my
strength return to me, etc.”’

*Gautama* (23.17-20).—‘A Student who has broken the vow of chastity
shall offer an ass to Nirṛti on the cross-road. Putting on the skin of
that ass, with the hair turned outside, and holding a red vessel in bis
hands, he shall beg at seven houses, proclaiming his deed. He will be
purified after a year. For an involuntary discharge caused by fear or
sickness, or during sleep, he shall make an offering of clarified
butter, or place two pieces of fuel in the fire reciting the two verses
beginning with “*Retasya*.”’

Do. (25.1-2).—‘They say.—How many gods does a Student enter who violates
the vow of chastity?—They announce—His vital spirits go to the Maruts,
his strength to Indra, his sacred learning to Bṛhaspati, all the rest to
Agni.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.30-35).—‘A Student approaching a woman is called
*Āvakīrṇin*;—he shall offer an ass as the sacrificial animal; the
sacrificial meat-cake shall be offered to Nirṛti, or to Rakṣas, or to
Yama. Or, he may heap fuel on the fire on the night of the New Moon,
perform the preparatory rites required for the *Darvihoma*, and offer
two oblations of clarified butter. After he has made the offering, he
shall address the fire, closely joining his hands, turning sideways,
with the following texts “May the Maruts grant me, etc., etc.”’

*Āpastamba* (1.26.8-9).—‘A Student who has broken the vow of chastity
shall offer to Nirṛti an ass, according to the manner of the *Pākayajña*
rites,—a Śūdra eating the remnants of that offering.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.1-3).—‘If a Student has approached a woman, he shall slay
in the forest, at a place where four roads meet, an ass for the
*Rakṣas*, after kindling a common fire. Or, he may offer an oblation of
rice to Nirṛti. He shall throw the oblations with the mantra—“To Lust
*Svāhā*, etc.”’

*Pāraskara-Gṛhyasūtra* (3.12.1-3, 6-8).

The ‘oblations into Fire’ are those spoken of in the texts
‘*Hṛdayasyāgre*, etc.’

‘*Finally*’— after the oblations have been finished,—he shall offer
oblations to the Maruts, to Indra, to Bṛhaspati and to Agni, with the
verse ‘*Samāsiñcantu marutaḥ samindraḥ sambṛhaspatiḥ sañcāyamagniḥ
siñcatu prajayā ca dhanea* (?) *ca*’ (Atharva-Veda Saṃhitā, 7.33.1).

Since the precise ‘deities’ of sacrifices are always those indicated by
the words of the *mantras* used at them, the words ‘*vāta*’ and ‘*guru*’
of the text should be taken as standing for ‘Maruts’ and ‘Bṛhaspati’
respectively. Hence when the offerings are actually made, the words
pronounced should be ‘*Marudbhyaḥ svāhā*’ and ‘*Bṛhaspataye svāhā*,’—and
not ‘*vātāya svāhā*’ and ‘*gurave svāhā*.’— (119)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 909), which notes that
(*a*) according to *Aparārkā* the ‘*ājya—homa*’ should begin with
‘*Vātāya svāhā*’ and end with ‘*Vahnayesvāhā*’ and after these
‘Principal offerings’ there should be one more offering of *Ājya* with
the mantra ‘*Samāsiñcantu etc*.’—(*b*) while according to
*Smṛtimañjarī*, after the ‘Principal offerings,’ the offering of
clarified butter with the mantra ‘*Samasiñcantu etc*.’ should be made to
Suvarchala and other deities;—so that in view of these two views, this
is a case of option.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 436);—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 1140), which adds the following notes:—The first
offerings to be made are the offerings of *Ājya* with the mantras
‘*Vātāya svāhā*’ and so forth;—the time for the offering is the ‘night,’
and that on the *Amāvāṣyā* day.

the term ‘*vrata*’ here stands for something other than the penances
mentioned in the present context

‘*Keeping up his vows*.’—On the strength of other Smṛti texts, this
should be understood to mean ‘one who is in the state of the Religious
Student’; as it is for such a one that emission of semen, even without
sexual intercourse, has been specially forbidden.

The treatment of Minor Offences has been finished.

‘*Any one*.’—This is only by way of reference; as a combination of
occasions is not possible; and further, if all the offences were meant
to be taken together, the expiation here spoken of would not be meant
for any one; what man is there who could ever commit all those deeds
that lead to the loss of caste? On the other hand, if expiation were to
be prescribed separately for each offence, there would be no end to the
teaching at all Nor would combination be otherwise advisable; as the
occasions and conditions of the expiation are set forth only as
qualifying the human agent For these reasons the declaration should be
taken as complete with each individual offence. Just as in connection
with the assertion ‘he whose father or grandfather has not drunk Soma
(shall perform a certain expiatory rite),’—the conclusion is that the
expiatory Animal-sacrifice becomes necessary when either one of the
ancestors—the father or the grandfather—has failed to drink *Soma*;—and
similarly in the declaration—‘when *both* sacrificial materials become
spoilt, etc.,’—even though it contains the term ‘both,’ yet the
expiatory ‘*Pañcaśarāva*’ sacrifice has to be performed even when only
one material becomes spoilt. The same principle is to be observed in the
case of all expiations.

‘*Intentionally*.’—This is meant to be emphasised; as also the
qualification ‘*unintentionally*.’

The exact form of the two penances, ‘Prājāpatya’ and ‘Sāntapana,’ shall
be described later on.—(124)

The acts ‘*conducive to the degradation of mixed caste*’ and ‘*those

(68 and 69); and the plural number is due to the large number of acts
included in these two sets.

The term ‘*Kṛtyā*,’ ‘*acts*’ is to be construed with each of the two
terms ‘*Saṅkara*’ and ‘*apātra*’ ‘*Kṛtyā* means *deed*.

‘*The monthly Lunar penance*’—is the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*.’
‘*Barley-products*’—articles of food prepared from barley,—fit for
drinking or sipping and so forth.

Though the expiation mentioned here is without any distinction, yet, a
distinction has always to be made in the lightness or heaviness of the
penance, according as the act is done *intentionally or
unintentionally*.—(125)

It has been said above that for the killing of a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya,
engaged in a sacrificial performance, the expiation shall be equal to
that for killing a Brāhmaṇa. The present verse applies to cases other
than these.

The ‘*fourth*’ and ‘*eighth*’ parts (of the expiation for killing a
Brāhmaṇa) have been prescribed in connection with such persons as are
fulfilling all their duties,—the term ‘*duty*’ standing for *all
duties*.

According to this rule, for the killing of a Kṣatriya, the expiation
shall last for *three years*, for that of a Vaiśya, for a *year and a
half*, and for that of a Śūdra, for *nine months*.

The expiation that has been laid down above (under 67) in connection
with ‘the killing of a woman, a Vaiśya or a Kṣatriya,’ pertains to the
case of those persons being such as have neglected their duties, and are
addicted to unrighteous acts.

‘*Duty*’ implies character. When the Vaiśya is one who has the character
of, and behaves like, a Vaiśya. The ‘duty’ of the Śūdra consists in
service of twice-born men and the like,—and not the performance of the
‘great sacrifices.’

The full expiation prescribed is to be performed in the case of the
death of persons firmly devoted to the performance of their
duties.—(126)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.266-267), as referring to such
Vaiśyas and Śūdras as are possessed of only a few good qualities;—it
explains the term ‘*vṛtta*’ as qualities of the heart and so forth, such
as ‘reverence for superiors, purity, cleanliness, truthfulness, control
of organs and goodwill towards all’;—and in the *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.
215).

The first half of the verse explains what is meant by the ‘one-fourth’
mentioned in the preceding verse.

‘*Wearing matted* *locks*.’— Some people hold that this is meant to
exclude the wearing of rags, carrying of a part of the bedstead and so
forth (which have been prescribed for the Brāhmaṇa-killer).

This, however, is not right. For what the present verse does is to apply
to the case in question the ‘one fourth’ part of only those details that
have been prescribed for the Brāhmaṇa-killer, and not of anything else,
even though some such be possible;—walking against the current, of the
Sarasvatī and such other (optional) details (laid down in 78 *et.
seq*.,) being adopted only when there is some necessity for them.

‘*Far off*’— All that this means is that he should not remain in the
village.

‘*Under the root of a tree*’;—*i.e*.., having built a hut there.—(128)

In a previous verse ‘*one eighth*’ was prescribed for the killing of a
Vaiśya; what the present verse lays down is ‘one twelfth.’

As the expiation is a light one, it has to be done ‘*for one* *year*.’

It appears that the rule here laid down is meant for the case of a
Vaiśya devoid of qualifications.

“The case of a Vaiśya *devoted to his duty* has been already dealt with
before.”

True; but what the present verse contemplates is the case of a Vaiśya
who was ‘righteous’ at the time of death, but was devoid of qualities
before that; while the previous rules apply to one who was righteous all
along.—(129)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“According to Govindarāja and Kullūka, the two penances are to be
performed optionally, in case a virtuous Vaiśya has been killed
unintentionally.—Medhātithi says that the first penance is to be
performed for the murder of a Vaiśya who was less distinguished than the
one referred to in verse 126.—Nārāyaṇa thinks that the verse refers to a
Vaiśya engaged in the performance of a sacrifice, and that the particle
‘*vā*’ takes the place of the?upola, and thus one penance only is
prescribed.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 216 and 534), which
explains ‘*ekaśatam*’ as ‘a hundred and one’.

In all eases, the *giving of the prescribed number of cows* should be
understood to be an optional alternative.

The mention of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ (in 127) in this connection is meant to
be only illustrative.

‘*White*’—does not mean *white in colour*, but pure in all points,
giving much milk, prone to give birth to females, and not in the habit
of losing her offsprings.—(130)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Inasmuch as the expiation prescribed is a heavy one, it should be
understood as applying to a case where *all* these animals have been
killed.

“It has been asserted in connection with offences leading to loss of
caste, etc., that a combination is not meant. How too is it ever
possible for all these animals to come up before any one man and be
killed? If only some of these were present, the required conditions
would not be there; in fact it would become a wholly different case.
Hence the person meant should be one who has killed one of these animals
*repeatedly*. But there is nothing in the text, to show that this is
what is meant Nor can the expiation be taken as referring to the killing
of each single animal, as there is in the case of such assertion as ‘one
should drink milk, etc., etc.’” (132)

Thus then, the sentence cannot be taken either as referring to each of
the animals severally, or as referring to all of them together; nor is
there any third way possible.

It has been said that a *combination cannot* be meant. If a combination
is not meant, then the only way in which the text could be taken would
be to take it as referring to each individual singly; just as there is
in the case of the assertion ‘he whose father or grandfather has not
drunk the Soma, etc., etc.’ But in a case (like the present) where it is
found that the whole sentence becomes meaningless if it is not taken as
referring to a combination of all the individuals, it is only right
that, with a view to avoid such a contingency, the sentence should be
taken as referring to such combination; for instance, in the case of the
text—‘In the case of killing a thousand animals etc.’ (140),—if a
combination were not meant, the mention of the specific number
‘thousand’ would be meaningless. It is only when, if the sense adopted
happens to be very much contrary to what has been laid down in other
scriptural texts, that such a sense can be rejected.

“But even in a case where a certain idea is expressed directly by the
words of the text, no significance is ever meant to be attached to the
qualifications involved in its indirect implication; for instance, in
the ease of the assertion—‘he whose both sacrificial materials become
spoilt, etc.’—significance is not meant to be attached to the exact
denotation of the term ‘both.’ In this sentence there are two terms
‘both’ and ‘sacrificial material’; and if significance is attached to
both these terms, there results syntactical split, as we shall explain
later on. When however it is doubtful whether in a given case
significance attaches to the ‘material’ or the ‘both’—the two have to be
taken separately, in order to avoid the syntactical split; or what is
predicated in the sentence has to be taken as having no connection with
one of the two terms. Now what is in closest proximity to the predicate
‘becomes spoilt’ is the term ‘material,’—as is clear from the fact that
its *number* is more in keeping with that of this term; so that the
other term becomes reiterative of the qualification of the ‘material.’
If on the other hand, no significance attaches to the term ‘material,’
then, the rest of the sentence can be taken only as declamatory. In the
case in question, if a combination wore meant to be expressed, or if
stress were to be laid upon the term ‘thousand’ (in 140), the whole
sentence would become meaningless. So that all that the passage would
mean is that—‘one should perform the penance of the
Śūdra-killer......(?),’ and that ‘the act of killing these is similar to
the killing of a Śūdra,’ and all that this would secure would he that;
these few animals would not he killed (?)”

On the principle here enunciated, we might regard other qualifications
also as not meant to be emphasised; for instance under Verse 142. And
all this would lead to a deal of incongruity. Then again the passage we
are dealing with is the work of a human author, and it does not belong
to the Veda. In the case of a Vedic passage, whose usage would it
represent? And whom could we charge with having made use of a
meaningless assertion? In the case of a passage like the present one, on
the other hand, which is the conscious work of a human author, if there
is an incongruity in regard to even a single syllable, the writer
becomes at once open to the charge of having made use of a meaningless
expression.

For all these reasons the only right course is to regard *combination*
and its qualification as both equally meant to be significant.

As regards the argument that there can be no possibility of so many
animals being killed at one and the same time,—it is quite possible for
those who go on hunting excursions and who follow the profession of
setting fire to forests.

Lastly as regards the argument, that if even a single one of these
several animals is not killed, there would be no occasion for the
prescribed expiation,—this also is not right. For just as in the case of
the killing of more animals than those enumerated, so also in that of
killing fewer than those, a proper adjustment of the requisite expiation
can always be made.—(131)

Other expiations are now laid down for the killing of any one of the
animals mentioned.

The term ‘*payaḥ*’ stands here for *milk*, and not *water*, though it
denotes both; just as it does in the passage ‘*payasā juhoti*’ (‘offers
milk’). As an analogous case we have the term ‘*varāha*,’ which, though
signifying both *clouds* and the *boar*, is more often used in the sense
of the latter; though this term ‘*varāha*’ signifies *mountain* also,
yet whenever it is used in this sense, it stands in need of some
co-ordinating term-such as ‘*Himavān-varāhaḥ*,’ (‘Himālaya Mountain’),
‘*varāhaḥ pāriyātraḥ*,’ (‘Pāriyātru Mountain’), and so forth.

In the case in question, it being dear that what the text mentions is an
article of food, by which the body could be maintained,—if we find the
term ‘*payas*,’ milk, it means that all other articles of food are to be
eschewed. This also is the right view to take in view of the fact that
what is meant, to be prescribed is a *penance*, ‘*tapas*,’—a *tapas*
being that which *causes pain* (*tāpayati*). This name ‘*tapas*’ is
given to such acts as the eating of clarified butter after *Prānāyāma*;
this, however, does not exclude the eating of other things, nor the
rinsing of the mouth, which would make the eating of clarified butter
along with something else impossible.

Nor can *water* be taken as an optional alternative for *milk* (both
being denoted by the term ‘*payas*’); what does form such an alternative
is that ‘*he* *shall bathe* *in a stream*,’ so that ‘drinking of milk,’
‘walking over 800 miles’ and ‘bathing in a stream’ are the possible
alternatives. The stress laid upon the terra ‘*stream*’ excludes the
bathing in tanks and pools.

‘*Sacred to the Waters*’—*i.e*., the ‘*Pavamāna*’ hymn beginning with
the verse ‘*Āpohiṣṭhā mayobhuvaḥ, etc., etc*.’

Another *Smṛti* text lays down also the eating of mixed food, and the
giving of an iron-rod as a gift,.

‘*Walk*’—not by way of travelling to a certain place; but walking on
foot (by way of penance).—(132)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“According to Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, these
penances are to be performed if the animal has been killed
unintentionally.—According to Medhātithi they have to expiate the
slaughter of a single animal.—The choice among the four penances
depends, according to Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, on the strength of the
offender, according to Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, on his caste and other
circumstances.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.270), as laying down the penances
for the killing of each of the animals severally;—in *Aparārka* (p.
1131) as referring to the killing of a cat;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
949), which explains ‘*upasparśa*’ as *bathing*, and adds that this
refers to unintentional killing; intentional killing involves double the
expiation here prescribed.

‘*Inconstant*.’—Those women who, behaving like prostitutes, have
intercourse with many men, are called ‘inconstant’; the epithet does not
connote merely transgression of the scriptures; as that would not
restrict the term to *adultery* only.

One should give the ‘leathern bag’ and other things in the order of the
castes.

‘*Jina*’—the leathern bag, used for carrying water and such purposes.

‘*Kārmuka*’—bow.

‘*Vaṣṭa*’—goat.

‘*Avi*’—sheep.

‘*Respectively*.’—This shows that the expiation here laid down is not to
be regarded as cumulative.

Some people read ‘*gatvā*’ (for ‘*hatvā*’) (‘having intercourse’). But
this is not right; since ‘killing’ forms the subject-matter of the
present context.—(138)

**(verses 11.140-141)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (50.46-47).—‘If he has killed a thousand small animals having
hones,—or an ox-load of boneless animals,—he must perform the same
penance as for killing a Śūdra. But if he has killed animals having
bones, he must also give some trifle to a Brāhmaṇa; if he has killed
boneless animals, he becomes purified by one breath-suspension.’

*Gautama* (22.20-2).—‘For killing one thousand small animals with bones,
also for killing an ox-load of boneless animals, the same penance as for
killing a cow; or he may also give something for the killing of each
animal with bones.’

*Āpastamba* (1.26.2).—‘For killing an ox-load of boneless animals, the
same penance as for killing a Śūdra.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21-25).—‘Having slain a quantity of boneless animals, equal
to the weight of a cow, one should perform the *Kṛcchra* penance of
twelve days’ duration, and also give something.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.269, 275).—‘For killing a thousand animals with bones,
or a cart-load of boneless animals, one should perform the same penance
as for killing a Śūdra. For killing an animal with bones, he shall give
something; and for killing a boneless animal, he shall perform
breath-suspension.’

‘*Some trifle*’ stands for a small thing—small in amount, in utility and
in price.

According to the older writers the expiation here laid down is for the
killing of a *single* animal.

As a matter of fact, there is no expiation at all for the killing of
boneless animals.

‘*Control of Breath*’ here stands for *self-control*.

The killing of ‘insects and worms,’ which has been mentioned among
‘defiling sins’ (under 11.70), is to be understood as referring to
insects of large size,—the present verse referring to little insects as
mosquitoes and the rest.—(141)

*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 241), which says that this refers to the killing

‘*Fruit-bearing trees*’—such as the Mango, the Kaṇṭakī and the like.

The *reciting of one hundred* *Ṛk* *verses* is meant for twice-born men.

“What then is to be the expiation for a Śūdra?”

Some people hold that for them the expiation shall be the same as for
the ‘*minor offence*’ of ‘cutting green trees for fuel.’ This, however,
cannot be right, as that would be too heavy.

“If that is too heavy, why should it have been prescribed in connection
with *minor offences*?”

The expiation laid down there was for repeated acts.

For these reasons, for the Śūdra cutting fruit-bearing trees, etc., the
expiation shall be fasting for two or three days.

‘*Shrubs*,’ *etc*.—have been already explained.

‘*Latā*’—stands here for branches of trees.—(142)

The creatures or living beings that are bred in cooked rice, and other
kinds of food kept for a long time.

‘*Bred in sauces*’—such as molasses, gruel and so forth.

The insects inside figs and such others are those ‘*bred in fruits and
flowers*.’

‘*Eating with clarified butter*’—that is, when one begins to take his
food, he should drink clarified butter;—the particle ‘*pra*’ in
‘*prāśa*’ denoting *beginning*. Hence what is laid down does not exclude
owlinary food, as is done in the case of the ‘*Payovrata*’ (subsisting
on milk) and other penances; and the reason for this lies in the
consideration that the creatures concerned are so insignificant that
mere ‘breath-control’ has been prescribed as the expiation for killing
them; so that the expiation in question (if it meant subsisting on
clarified butter *only*) would be too heavy for such a trifling offence.
Hence what is meant by ‘eating with clarified butter’ is that just a
little of it should he sipped in the beginning.—(143)

Inasmuch as in connection with this ‘Initiation,’ the use of the
girdle-zone and other things has been forbidden, it follows that it
stands here for ‘Initiation’; and on the strength of another Smṛti-text,
this should be accompanied by the ‘*Tapta-kṛcchra*’ penance. Says
Gautama—‘In the case of unintentional drinking of wine, one should live
for three days upon milk, clarified butter, water and air, performing
the Tapta-kṛcchra,—then should follow his Initiation’ (23.2).

The ‘*wine*’ meant here is not that which is distilled from grains, but
those that are distilled from molasses and honey.

“From what does this follow?”

It follows from what we learn from another Smṛti-text—‘The Brāhmaṇa who
unintentionally drinks wine *other than that distilled from grains*,
becomes pure by subsisting, for ten days, on cow’s urine, and
barley-products.’ So that in the case of the unintentional drinking of
wine distilled from grains, there is to be an ordinary form of expiation
(and not Re-initiation),—either in the one form of the penance involving
the subsisting for one year on pieces of grain, or in the performance of
the ‘Chāndrāyaṇa.’

In the case of the *intentional* drinking of even the two kinds of wine
(that distilled from molasses and that distilled from honey), the
aforesaid expiation should not be prescribed; in such a case, the
expiation should be one that brings about the death of the offender.

“What expiation would this be?”

The same that has been prescribed above for the drinking of the wine
that is distilled from grains, which is the most important form of wine.

This, however, should be understood to apply to cases of *repeated*
drinking (of the two kinds of wine); since for *once* drinking wines
*other than that distilled from grains*, the performance of the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* penance has been laid down.

Thus the ‘*settled law*’ on this point is as follows:—(*a*) If one
drinks intentionally the wine distilled from grains, there should be a
penance ending in death;—(*b*) if he drinks that same wine
unintentionally, and once only, he should live upon pieces of grain and
perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa*;—(*c*) if he does it unintentionally, but
repeatedly, then it shall be just as in the case of intentional
drinking;—(*d*) in the case of the intentional drinking of other wines,
one should perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa*;—(*e*) in the case of the
unintentional drinking of these, once only, there should be the
‘*Tapta-kṛcchra*’ Initiation and subsisting on cow’s urine and
barley-products;—and (*f*) in the case of unintentional, but repeated,
drinking of these, it shall be just as in the case of the wine distilled
from grains.—(146)

(Medhātithi and Nandana);—‘Any expiation involving death shall not be
prescribed even in the wise of the intentional drinking of Vāruṇī’
(Nārāyaṇa and others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1074), which explains the meaning
to be—‘The intentional drinking of *Surā* is an offence for which no
expiation can be prescribed by any Assembly; it has to be found out by
the offender himself.’ It adds that the re-performance of the
sacramental rites in itself cannot absolve the man from the sin; these
rites have to be performed after the man has undergone the expiation
specifically prescribed for wine-drinking.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.255), which adds that the sacramental
rites are to be performed after the performance of the *Tapta-Kṛcchra*.

It is quoted in *Parāyaścittaviveka* (p. 100), which explains the second
half to mean that ‘if one drinks wine *intentionally*, then the
expiation just prescribed will not serve his purpose his only expiation
will consist in giving up his life.’

*Gautama* (23.2).—‘If the Brāhmaṇa has drunk wine unintentionally, he
shall subsist for three days on hot milk, clarified hatter and water;
and inhale hot air. This penance is called *Tapta-Kṛcchra*. After that
he shall undergo a second initiation.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.19).—‘For unintentionally drinking wine one shall
perform the *Kṛcchra* penance for three months and he initiated again.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.19).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa intentionally drinks liquor other
than that distilled from rice, or if he unintentionally drinks liquor
extracted from rice, he must perform a *Kṛcchra* and an *Atikṛcchra*,
and after eating clarified butter, he initiated again.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.1-4).—‘A drinker of liquor must abstain from all religions
rites and subsist on grains separated from the husk, for a year. If a
man has knowingly tasted any of the excretions of the body, or of
intoxicating drinks, he should perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance. In all
these cases, the twice-born man shall be initiated a second time, after
the penance is over,’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.255).—‘On drinking the Vāruṇī wine or semen, or urine
or ordure, unwittingly, the three twice-born castes shall undergo
initiation a second time.’

This expiation refers to the drinking of water out of a vessel in which
the taste of wine is felt.

“The term ‘*madya*,’ ‘intoxicating drink,’ being a general one, all that
is intended would be secured from the single word ‘*contained in a pot
used far keeping intoxicating drinks*’; and the other word ‘*contained
in a vessel used for keeping nine*’ should not have been used.”

True; this would be so if there were not a great difference between the
expiations prescribed for the drinking of ‘wine’ and of ‘intoxicating
drinks.’ When, however, there *is* such a difference, it would appear
that, there should be a correspondingly heavier expiation for the
drinking of water contained in a *wine-vessel*;—and it is with a view to
preclude this idea that the text prescribes the same expiation for both.

‘*For five days he shall drink milk in which Śaṅkha-puṣpī has been
boiled*.’ The term ‘*payas*’ here stands for *milk*; because the
particular term ‘*śhṛta*’ (in the sense of *boiled*) is used only in
connection with *milk* and sacrificial materials.

‘*Śaṅkhapuṣpī*’ is the name of a medicinal herb; and this shall be
pounded and boiled in milk, which shall be drunk for five days.—(147)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1074), which explains that
‘*payaḥ*’ here stands for *milk*;—again on p. 1160, where it is added
that this refers to cases where the water has been drunk and vomitted by
women or children, and it was contained in a vessel that had contained
wine, hut was not wet with it, so that the water had not imbibed either
the taste or the smell of the liquor.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 349), which adds that
this refers to cases of unintentional repeated drinking of the
water;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 324), which says that ‘*payaḥ*’
means *milk*; ‘*Śaṅkhapuṣpī*’ is a particular herb.

vessel used for keeping wine, he becomes pure by drinking, during three
days, water mixed with a decoction of lotus, Udumbara, Bilva, and Palāsa
leaves.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.23-24).—‘After having drunk water from a vessel in which

‘*Odour given out by a wine-drinker*.’—The odour that conies out of the
mouth of a person who has drunk wine, is due to its digestion undergone
in the stomach and contact with other substances therein contained;
hence the offence is a comparatively light one. The odour of wine kept
in a vessel, can be easily avoided (hence the inhaling of its odour
would be a serious offence).

Others explain the text to mean that this same expiation applies to a
case where the said odour is inhaled by a Brāhmaṇa who is habituated to
drinking wine.

‘*Who has partaken of Soma*’— This specification implies that what is
said here does not apply to the case of one who has performed the
*Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices.

‘*Eating clarified butter*.’—Here also, the eating of other things is
not precluded.

Since ‘*wine*’ has been mentioned by name, what is said here does not
apply to the case of other *intoxicating drinks*.—(149)

‘*Ordure or wine*’—is meant to include *semen* also; since we read in
another Smṛti—‘This same expiation applies to the case of the eating of
ordure, stenching corpse *and semen*.’

“Whose *ordure* and *urine* are meant here?”

Of men; the ease of those of other animals we shall deal with later on.

In connection with this offence also, the ‘*Tapta* - *Kṛcchra*’ has to
be combined with what is here laid down; reasons for which have been
already explained above.

Stress is meant to be laid upon the term ‘*twice-born*’; since another
expiation for Śūdras is going to be laid down later on.

‘*Unwittingly*.’—This is only a reiteration; who is there who would
swallow ordure or urine *intentionally*?

Further, in connection with the (intentional) drinking of intoxicants,
it has been laid down that ‘having partaken of an intoxicant, one should
perform the ‘*Kṛcchra*’; so that if Initiation were the only expiation
meant for the *intentional* swallowing of ordure and urine, the text
would imply that both (eating of ordure and drinking of an intoxicant)
stand on the same footing (which is absurd).

‘*Vows*’—are understood to be those laid down in connection with Vedic
study. But this is not right; since those vows have been laid down with
a view to proper *study*, and hence there could be no possibility of
their coming in on the occasion of Re-initiation. \[So that the rule
declaring their omission would be redundant\] Hence the ‘vows’ in the
present context should be understood to be those that are set before the
student in such words as—‘Do not sleep during the day,’ ‘Fetch fuel in
the morning and in the evening,’ ‘Be obedient to the Preceptor,’ and so
forth. It is these that are omitted on the Re-initiation.—(151)

Those persons are said to be ‘*of unfit food*’ whose food people do not
eat; *i.e*., those ignorant of the Veda, those who make a living by
their wife, those who live upon war, those who sacrifice for persons not
entitled to sacrifice, and so forth.

Since the term ‘*Śūdra*’ itself, which stands for both sexes, would
include the Śūdra woman also,—the term ‘*woman*’ should be understood to
stand for a woman of the same caste as the person concerned.

‘*Left*’—means *touched by the mouth*.

As for the assertion that ‘the mouth of women is always pure’ (5.130),
the exact scope of that has been already explained.

In connection with the drinking of water *left by a Śūdra*, a previous
text (149) has laid down the ‘drinking of Kuśa-water,’ while the present
text prescribes the drinking of ‘barley’ for seven days. And since the
matter is a purely scriptural one, what is said in the present verse
should be taken as referring to the eating of such food as *cooked rice*
and the like.

‘*Forbidden flesh*’— of such birds, for instance, as the *Plava*, the
*Haṃsa*, the *Cakravāka* and the like.

What is here prescribed should be understood as referring to cases where
the act is repeatedly and intentionally done. For other cases, the
expiation would be the general one that—‘in the case of the rest, one
should fast for the day.’

This same expiation also applies to the case of the drinking of all
kinds of *forbidden milk*, with the exception of the milk of the sow,
the camel and such other animals,—in connection with which special
expiations have been directly prescribed.

When one drinks the ‘gruel’ (of barley), it becomes the *drinking* *of*
‘*barley*.’—(152)

‘*Pure soured liquids*’—such as have been permitted, as ‘among soured
liquids, curds are eatable, etc.’ (5.10). As regards *curds*, however,
the present text has nothing to do with it; for even though it is a
‘soured liquid,’ its eatability has been distinctly asserted; in fact
the texts declare that it is a *purifying* substance.

‘*Decoctions*’—are well-known in medical works, as prepared by the
boiling of herbs.

‘Impure’—defiled.

‘Until *it has gone down*’— ‘Going down’ stands for their being digested
and passed out in the form of urine and excreta; or it may mean simply
reaching the digestive organ.—(153)

‘*Dried meat*’— such for instance, as dried pork and so forth.

‘*Growing m the ground*.’—This epithet has been added with a view to
show that those growing in cavities are not forbidden.

‘*Unrecognised*’—it being unascertainable whether it is flesh of sheep
or of buffalo.

‘*Slaughter-house*’—where animals are killed for sale. In the case of
meat found in other places, the expiation is a light one.

“In fact when the text emphasises the qualification of ‘*lying in the
slaughter-house*,’ there should be no harm in meat obtained elsewhere.”

It is not so; since all meat connected with the ‘slaughterhouse’ has
been forbidden in general terms. Though as regards expiation, a
comparative reduction or enhancement would always he proper, in view of
the exact place from where the meat has been obtained.

‘*This same*’—*i.e*., the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.

When, however, the exact species of the animal is known, the repeated
eating of such meat, would involve the drinking of barley-gruel for
seven days. In the rest, ‘one should fast during the day.’—(155)

The particle ‘*ca*’ indicates that the previous verse
([154])
also is to be construed with the present one; so that for the eating of
the meat of the village-pig and other animals mentioned therein, this
same should be the expiation.

And the second ‘*ca*’ indicates that the expiation for swallowing the
ordure or urine of carnivorous and other animals (mentioned in the
present verse), would be the same as that in the case of that of the
village-pig and other animals ([mentioned in
154]);
but with this difference that in another *Smṛti*, what is laid down in
the present verse is found to be applied to the case of *all men*; hence
so far as the present verse is concerned, no significance can be
attached to the specification of ‘twice-born men’ ([in
154]),
where it is said that ‘the twice-born man shall perform the Cāndrāyaṇa.’

Thus these two verses
([154]
and 156) should be taken along with [Verse
159];
so that the eating of what has been touched by the mouth of these
animals (mentioned in the present verse) shall be treated on the same
footing as the eating of things touched with the mouth of the cat and
other animals ([mentioned in
159]).

On the same ground, the ordure and urine of all the animals (mentioned
in the three verses) become forbidden; so that the expiation for the
swallowing of the ordure and urine of the cat and other animals
([mentioned in
159])
would be the same as that for the swallowing of those of the carnivorous
and other animals (mentioned in the present verse).—(156)

‘*Monthly rite*’—*i.e*., the ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’ *śrāddha*, which is performed
every month, for one year, till the performance of the
‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*.’ Though the *śrāddha* performed on the new-moon day is
also called a ‘monthly śrāddha,’ eating at it has been permitted by such
texts as—‘when invited he may freely eat’; how then could there be any
expiation needed in this case?

Others have held that what is permitted is eating *on invitation*, so
that if one eats *without invitation* at the new-moon śrāddhas also, he
should be liable to the said expiation.

‘*Who has not completed his course of study*’—*i.e*., while one is still
residing with the teacher; *i.e*., the Religious Student.

Out of the three days, on any ono day, he may remain in water. Since the
‘three days’ are mentioned, there would be no justification for adding a
fourth day.—(157)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1144), which explains ‘*Māsika*’
as standing for the *Śrāddha* that is done every month during the first
year on the date of death, and *not* for the *Amāvāsyā śrāddha*;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 307), which says that this refers to the act
being *unintentional*, and adds that ‘*māsikānnam*’ refers to food given

‘*Person keeping a vow*’—*i.e*., one who is still in the stage of the
Religious Student.

‘*In any way*’—*i.e*., even in normal times; in abnormal times, when
life is in danger, the eating of the two things has been permitted; so
that there being nothing wrong in such eating, the present verse cannot
he taken as laying down as an expiation for the same, thereby
contradicting what has gone before. Hence what the meaning is that the
expiation is necessary only under certain conditions, not always.

‘*Original Kṛcchra*’—*i.e*., the *Prājāpatya*; which is called
‘original,’ because it forms the *origin* or *archetype* of all
*Kṛcchras*.

‘*He should complete the remainder of his vow*’—This shows that until
the prescribed expiation has been performed, the man is not entitled to
complete the vow.—(158)

The first half of the verse is purely reiterative; as what the verse
lays down is the expiation for the unintentional eating of improper food

The meaning is that the food should be immediately vomited. Or ‘*it
should be atoned, for by means of purifications*’ —*i.e*., expiations.

Others explain ‘*purifications*’ as standing for the *Harītakī* and such
other purgatives; and they quote, in their support, the following from
Gautama (23.23)—‘For eating improper food, the bowels should be cleared
of all refuse.’

This passage, however, does not support the said interpretation; as even
fasting would *clear the bowels of all ref use*.

Hence the meaning must be that in the event of the man not vomiting the
food, he should perform the prescribed expiations.—(160)

‘*Chief of twice-born men*’— This is only illustrative; it includes the
Kṣatriya and the rest also; but inasmuch as the text has used the term
‘*chief of twice-born men*,’ the phrase ‘*from the house of a
caste-fellow*’ is understood to signify *from the house of a Brāhmaṇa*.
Hence the meaning comes to be this:—‘Men of all castes, on stealing
wealth from the house of a Brāhmaṇa, would become pure by performing the
*Kṛcchra* for one year.’

The term ‘*wealth*’ including all kinds of property, ‘grains’ and
‘cooked food’ have been specially mentioned, for the purpose of
indicating the better quality of grains; as for the stealing of grains
of inferior quality, another expiation is going to be prescribed; from
which it follows that what is here laid down applies to the stealing of
the more important varieties of grains of superior quality.

“From among the various castes, if the Brāhmaṇa steals the property of
other castes, what shall be the expiation?”

It shall be computed at the ‘fourth,’ the ‘eighth’ and other parts of
what is here prescribed; just as we have found in the ease of murder
(sec. 127). That is, when the Brāhmaṇa steals the property of a
Kṣatriya, he shall perforin the Kṛcchra or three months; in the case of
the property of a Vaiśya, for a month and a half, and in that of a
Śūdra, for twenty-two days.

“What is the quantity of grains, the stealing of which would make one
liable to the said expiation?”

More than,—or even a little less than—ten jarfuls. That such is the
meaning is indicated by the heaviness of the expiation prescribed.

A similar computation may he made in regard to ‘*wealth*’ also.

‘*Intentionally*.’— This is added only for the purpose of filling up the
verse; as there can be no *unintentional* stealing of what belongs to

‘*Grains*’—Vrīhi and the rest,

‘*Cooked food*’—grains and meat

When every one of the three tilings is stolen, the *Kṛcchra* should be
performed for three years.

Some people take the expiation here laid down as meant for the stealing
of all the three things mentioned, on the ground that it is a very heavy
one.—(162)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3. 265);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.

other than gold,—‘*dvijottama*,’ Brāhmaṇa,—his ‘*svajāti*’ is
Brāhmaṇa;—this refers to cases where the Brāhmaṇa has stolen;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 427);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.

‘*Men*’—slaves.

‘*Women*’—slave girls.

‘*Field*’—plot of land, where *Vrīhi* and other corns are grown.

The word ‘*water*’ is to be construed both with ‘*wells* and *tanks*.’
What is here laid down applies to a case where water has been drawn from
the well or the tank and preserved in a cistern and such, other smaller
reservoirs.

From the mention of ‘*water*’ here it follows that for the
misappropriating of *dry* wells and tanks, there is another law.

‘*Vāpī*’ is a synonym for ‘*taḍāga*’ (tank).—(163)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), which notes that it refers
to a case where the quantity of water stolen is such as could be
obtained for 250 *Panas*;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 876), which notes
that this refers to the stealing of men belonging to Kṣatriya and other
castes; the stealing of the Brāhmaṇa being regarded as on the same
footing as the stealing of gold;—‘*vāpi*’ and ‘*kūpa*’ have been added
as qualifications for the purpose of excluding water contained in jars
and other vessels. It quotes *Aparārka* as holding that the expiation
here prescribed refers to the ‘stealing’ of tanks and wells full of
water,—and also the above-mentioned remark of *Mitākṣarā*. It adds that
this expiation is to be performed after the stolen article has been
returned to the owner.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 344), which says that
‘*manuṣya*’ and ‘*strī*’ stand here for male and female slaves.

‘*In the house of another*.’—The stealing of things lying in the house
is a serious offence; not so that of things lying in the field or in the
courtyard.

‘*Restored*’—given back. This pertains to all cases of theft, as it has

The expiation here laid down is for the stealing of grass and other
things, in such quantities, as would be more valuable than the
‘conveyance’ and other things mentioned in the preceding verse,

‘*Wood*’— hot made into any article. That this is what is meant follows
from its occurring along with ‘trees.’

‘*Druma*’ is tree.

‘*Dry food*’—either rice, or fried barley.

‘*Molasses*.’— This stands for things made of molasses; so that
sugarcandy and other sweetmeats become included.

‘*Caila*’ is *cloth*;—*i.e*., of large quantities of valuable cloth.

The expiation here laid down is an optional alternative to the *Kṛcchra*
that would be necessary in accordance with what is laid down in Verse
163, where the stealing of ‘wealth’ (which includes cloth) has been
dealt with.

‘*Leather*’ stands here for *armour*.

‘*Māṃsa*’—meat.—(166)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), which adds that since the
expiation here prescribed is thrice as heavy ns that prescribed in the
proceeding verse, the ‘grass’ and other things mentioned here should be
taken to be of that quantity which would be obtainable at a price three
times that of the single meal.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1110), which notes that this refers to
the stealing of ‘grass’ and other things whose value is three times that
of the single meal of one man;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 875);—and in
*Prāyaścittviveka* (p. 345), which explains ‘*Śuṣkānna*’ as ‘rice &c.’,

for two meals, for stealing more than that, there should be heavier
expiation.

Even though the text speaks generally of ‘the penance prescribed for the
violation of the Preceptor’s Bed,’ without any qualifications, yet it
does not mean the application to the present case of what has been said
regarding ‘sleeping on a redhot iron-bedstead,’ and so forth (under
Verse 104); what it does mean, however, is the performing for one year
of the ‘Prājāpatya penance,’ which has been laid down in Verse 106. That
such must be the meaning is clear from the fact that the violating of
the Preceptor’s Bed is a ‘heinous offence’; and apart from the ‘heinous
offences,’ there is no penance leading to death; though there may be
this in cases of repetition (of non-heinous offences also).

‘*Svayoni*’—uterine sister.

‘*Wife of a friend*.’—The consort of a loving friend; what constitutes
the seriousness of this offence is the affectionate regard of the
friend, and not any blood-relationship, nor any such qualification of
the husband as Vedic learning and the like.

Similarly in the case of ‘*the wife of his son*’—the daughter-in-law.

‘*Unmarried maiden*’—of other castes also. This is meant to refer to
intercourse with those who have not yet been given away by their
fathers, and who have not surrendered themselves through love,—the
intercourse being entirely by force.

In connection with this also, the exact penance shall be regulated by
several considerations. Though the text has added no qualifications to
the general application of the law relating to the ‘violation of the
Preceptor’s bed,’ yet in any two cases there may be two distinct
penances, as is actually found to be the case. For instance, on account
of the comparative heaviness or lightness of the offence, there would,
in the case of women of the lower castes, be the performance of the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* for three months, which would be lighter than that of the
*Kṛcchra* for one year (which would have to be done in the case of other
women).

‘*Lowest-born* ’—*Caṇḍāla* and *Mleccha* women. In the case of *Caṇḍāla*
women, a distinction in the penance has to be made on the ground of the
act being intentional or unintentional,—as is clear from other *Smṛti*
texts. For instance, in the case of women of the ‘*antyāvasāya*’ caste,
the penance would be a ‘Half-Kṛcchra,’ while in others, it would be one
lasting for twelve days.—(170)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 544);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 252), as referring to cases where the act is repeated
for one month;—and again on p. 264, where it says that it refers to
cases of repeated acts when *unintentional*, but a single act when
*intentional*;—also in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 181 and 187), which says
that this refers to cases other than those where the intercourse has
been within the forbidden circle,—it explains ‘*Svayoniṣu*’ as ‘one’s
own paternal and maternal relatives’—‘*antyajāṣu*’ as ‘Chaṇḍāla
women—and ‘*Gurutalpavratam*’ as the ‘twelve years penance.’

[(See text under 49,

*Gautama* (23.12, 13, 32).—‘The guilt of one who has intercourse with
the wife of a friend, a sister, a female belonging to the same family,
the wife of a pupil, a daughter-in-law,—or with a cow—is as great as
that of him who violates the Guru’s bed. Some people declare the guilt
of such a person to be equal to that of a Student who breaks the vow of
continence. For intercourse with a female of one of the lowest castes,
one shall perform a *Kṛcchra* penance during one year.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.13-14).—‘Intercourse with females who must not be
approached, cohabitation with the female friend of a female *Guru*, with
the female friend of a male *Guru*, with an *Apapātra* woman, or with a
female outcast,......... the expiation is to live like an outcast for
two years.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.15-16).—‘The expiation for intercourse with the wife of a
teacher, of a son, or of a pupil is that, having shaved all his hair and
smeared his body with clarified butter, the man shall embrace the heated
iron-image of a woman. If he has had intercourse with a female
considered venerable in the family, with a female friend, with the
female friend of a *Guru*, with an *Apapātra* female, or with an
outcast,—he shall perform the *Kṛcchra* penance for three months.’

*Viṣṇu* (34.1-2).—‘Sexual connection with one's mother, or daughter, or
daughter-in-law are crimes of the highest degree. Such criminals of the
highest degree should proceed to the flames; there is no other way of
atoning for their crime.’

Do. (53.1),—‘One who has had illicit sexual intercourse must perform the
*Prājāpatya* penance for one year,—according to the rule of the
*Mahāvrata*, clad in a garment of bark and living in a forest.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.231-232).—‘Intercourse with a friend’s wife, a maiden,
a uterine sister, with women of the lowest castes, with women of the
same *gotra*, with a daughter-in-law,—is declared to be as heinous as
that of violating the Guru’s bed. A man who has intercourse with his
father’s sister, or mother's sister, or maternal aunt, or
daughter-in-law, or step-mother, or sister, or his preceptor’s daughter,
or his preceptor’s wife, or his own daughter,—is *a violator of the
Guru’s bed*; he should have his organ cut off and killed; so also the
woman who fell in love with him.’

“The unmarriageability of these being already implied by the law that no
‘sapiṇḍa’ relation shall be wedded, for what special purpose does the
present text assert that *they are not fit to be married*?”

Some people offer the following explanation:—It is asserted here with a
view to permit the option of marrying such relations other than these
three as have been precluded on the ground of Sapiṇḍa-relationship.

This, however, is not right Because the present text is meant to lay
down the expiation necessary in the case of these three, which is
different from that in the case of other Sapiṇḍa relations; and so long
as this explanation of the text is possible, it would be highly improper
to reject, even partially, the injunctions of the text forbidding the
marrying of all ‘Sapiṇḍa relations’; options are admitted only when they
cannot be avoided.

‘*Jñāti*’—blood-relation.

‘*Not fit to be married*’— not fit to be wedded, or for intercourse.

‘*Marrying*’— wedding.

‘*Sinks low*’— that is, he falls into hell; or it may mean that he
becomes degraded in caste, comes to belong to a lower caste. Though in
reality, a man’s caste cannot leave him so long as his body lasts, yet
what is meant is that he ceases to be entitled to the performance of his
caste-functions.—(172)

‘*Non-human females*’—the mare and the like.

Though the *cow* also is ‘non-human,’ yet in connection with it, a
distinct expiation has been laid down by Gautama (23. 12-13).—‘For
intercourse with a friend, a sister, a woman of the same *gotra*, the
wife of the pupil, the daughter-in-law, and the cow, the expiation shall
be equal to that for the violation of the Preceptor’s bed, or that for
the immoral religions student.’ Between the two optional alternative
expiations laid down by Gautama, viz., that prescribed for violating the
Preceptor’s bed and that for the immoral religious student,—one has to
be taken as pertaining to cases where the act has been intentional, and
the other to those in which it has been unintentional.

In Gautama’s text, the term used is simply ‘*talpa*’ (bed), which, in
view of the context in which it occurs, must be taken as standing for
the ‘*gurutalpa*’ (Preceptor’s Bed);—and the term ‘*avakara*’ should be
taken as standing for ‘avakīrṇa’ ‘Immorality,’ which, being the cause of
the expiation, indicates the *expiation* itself. The word ‘*sakhī*’
(friend) in Gautama’s text stands for a woman with whom friendship has
been contracted in the same-manner as with men; and it does not mean
‘the wife of a friend’; since the feminine affix here does not denote
relation to the corresponding masculine; nor can this term be construed
with the term ‘wife’ (coming later); since between the two we have the
term ‘*sayoni*’ (sister). Vaśiṣṭha also uses the term in the same sense
in the passage—‘*Gurvī, sakhī*, eta’

‘*Menstruating woman*’—the woman who is in her monthly courses.

Another reading is ‘*pītvādharam puruṣaḥ*, *etc*.’ The sense remains the
same.

‘*Ayoni*’—a place other than the female organ.

Some people read (for ‘*jale chaiva*’) ‘*jale khe ca*’ \[which means ‘in
water and in *Ākāśa*’\].

‘The *Ākāśa* being already included in the term ‘*ayoni*,’ ‘places other
than the female organ,’—it need not be mentioned (by means of the word
‘*khe*’); as ‘*kha*’ stands for *Ākāśa*, which certainly is ‘a place
other than the female organ.’ There is no force in this objection. As
some people think that the presence of the term ‘*yoni*’ (in the
compound term ‘*ayoni*’) indicates that the term stands for *other parts
of the ‘body*’ \[and under this view, the mention of *Ākāśa* would not
be superfluous\].

‘*In water*’—directly.—(173)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

There is expiation for approaching, for eating the food of, and
accepting gifts from, women of the ‘*Caṇḍāla*’ caste, as also of the
‘Mleccha’ tribes inhabiting the boundaries of the land.

‘*Becomes an outcast*.’—All that this means is that the expiation shall
be heavier than the ‘performance of the *Kṛcchra* for one year,’—and not
that the man actually becomes an *outcast*.

The partaking of the ‘food’ has been mentioned here for the purpose of
indicating that the expiation in this case shall be the ‘performance of
the *Kṛcchra* for one year,’ and not that which has been laid down in
connection with ‘the eating of the food of persons whose food should not
be eaten’ ([Verse
152]).

Similarly the ‘*receiving of gifts*’ also has been mentioned here for
the purpose of indicating the said *Kṛcchra* as the expiation, and not
‘the drinking of milk in a cow-pen for a month’ (which is going to be
prescribed in Verse 194 below).

‘*If he does it intentionally, he becomes her equal*.’—This is only a
declamatory assertion intended to lay down an expiation. What has been
asserted in another *Smṛti* text regarding the expiation for the
intentional and unintentional act, has already been explained; how then
could it be taken as meant to imply a heavier expiation?

‘*Saving taken food*.’—“With what is this to be construed?”

With the term ‘*Caṇḍāla or other lowest-born caste*!

“But this term is the subordinate factor in the compound
(‘*Caṇḍalāntyastriyaḥ*,’ where ‘*strī*,’ ‘woman,’ is the predominant
factor).”

It has been often shown that a subordinate factor also may be construed
with other words, when the sense demands it. The text having said
‘having taken the food,’—and the question arising as to whose food is
meant,—as no one else is mentioned in the text, it naturally follows
that it has to be taken with^(‘)the Caṇḍāla and other lowest-born
castes.’ The sense thus comes to be this—‘If one eats the food of the
Caṇḍāla and the Mleccha,—and if he receives gifts from them,—and
approaches their women, etc., etc.’

The expiation here laid down is for approaching the woman only once. In
the event of the act being repeated, the offender must become ‘equal’ to
the woman, on account of his being disqualified (from all the privileges
of his own caste). The sin of the repeated acts could not be atoned for
by means of expiations; for every cause would have its effect; and all
the expiatory rites—necessary for the atoning of the sin of the repeated
acts—could not be performed during a single life-time.’—(175)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 348), which adds the
following notes:—By doing the act unintentionally the man ‘falls’,
‘*patati*’, *i.e*., becomes sinful; hence the repetition of the act
involves the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance—when done intentionally, the act
makes the man turn into the same caste; hence the repetition of this
would involve expiation by death; which however applies only to the act
repeated during a long period of time.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1121), which notes that the said
‘equality’ involves expiation by death;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 543);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 88), as referring to eases of
intentional continuation of the act for a long time;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 160, 187, 258, 412), which says that this
prescribes the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance’ for the *unintentional* eating of
the Caṇḍāla’s food;—that the accepting of gifts also that is meant is
twenty-four unintentional repetitions of the acceptance.

Do. (53.9).—‘That guilt which a Brāhmaṇa incurs by intercourse with a

*Baudhāyana* (2.4.14).—‘They quote the following:—“A Brāhmaṇa who

If she is ‘*particularly corrupt the husband should keep her
confined*’—*i.e*., keep her away from all the duties of a wife’ such as
‘the collecting of wealth’ and so forth (described under 9.11).

‘*In one room*’—*i.e*., she should be kept in chains, and should not be
permitted to roam about at will in her husband’s house.

While thus confined, she should be made to perform the necessary
expiation.

“What expiation?”

‘*That penance which, has been prescribed for males in cases of
adultery*’—that is, in the case of a Brāhmaṇa, adultery, when committed
upon a woman of equal or inferior castes, is to be treated as a ‘minor
offence,’ which involves the corresponding expiation. So also in the
case of men of other castes; but when these latter commit the act on a
woman of a superior caste, the expiation for the Vaiśya shall be double;
it shall be triple in the case of a Kṣatriya misbehaving with a Brāhmaṇa
woman. But for a Vedic scholar, the expiation shall be trebled;—when a
Śūdra misbehaves with a Brāhmaṇa woman, the expiation is that which has
been prescribed for ‘heinous offences’;—when a Vaiśya misbehaves with a
Kṣatriya woman, it is to be treated as a ‘minor offence.’ All this
distinction has been explained under ‘Punishments,’ The rules regarding
women misbehaving with men of inferior castes shall be the same as those
relating to men misbehaving with women of superior castes.

But though the offence may be equal, the corresponding expiation for
women shall be only *half* (of what is prescribed for males);—‘women and
sick men, boys up to the sixteenth year of age and men after or beyond
the eightieth year are subject to only one-half of the prescribed
expiation’—says a text

The expiation is lighter in the case of a woman whose unchastity is well
known. For instance, if one misbehaves with an unchaste low-caste woman,
he should bathe along with his clothes and give a water-jar to a
Brāhmaṇa; and if with a similar Vaiśya woman, he should take food at the
fourth meal-time and feed Brāhmaṇas; if with a Kṣatriya woman, he should
fast for three days and should give a *yavāṭaka*. It has also been
declared that he may be treated like a Vaiśya. The same should be
understood to be the case with the wife of a Śūdra. In connection with
people having intercourse with women during their courses or bringing
about their conception, it has been declared that—‘if women of the
Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya castes, have intercourse with a Śūdra,
they could be purified by expiations, if they have not conceived,—not
otherwise.’

In the case of women who have not been wedded by any one, and live by
prostitution, it is doubtful whether or not an expiation is necessary
for having intercourse with them.

“Why should there be any such doubt?”

Because the term ‘*dāra*,’ ‘wife,’ connotes consecration (a woman who
has passed through the sacrament of marriage); and when no marriage has
been performed, the woman cannot be called any one’s ‘wife and
expiations are necessary only in the case of intercourse with the
‘*wife*’ *of another person*. This would lead us to the conclusion that
in the case in question no expiation is needed. On the other band, since
it has been laid down that ‘one should remain attached *to his own*
wife,’ we think that there should be expiation in the case in question
(as it involves infidelity to one’s own wife).

“What then is the right view on this point?”

The right view is that expiation *is* necessary.

“Why so?”

Because the restriction (that one should he devoted to his own wife) has
been directly *enjoined*, and expiation has been declared to be
necessary in the case of one’s omitting to do what has been *enjoined*
(11.41). Even though the offence may not fall under the category of
‘minor offences,’ yet that does not mean that there is to be no
expiation. The various kinds of offences—‘minor offences,’ ‘offences
leading to loss of caste,’ and so forth—have been enumerated, not by way
of an exhaustive list (of offences requiring expiation), but only for
the purpose of indicating the necessary expiations. The condition common
to all offences has been summed up as—‘omitting to do what is enjoined,
etc., etc.’ (11.44). The ease of the ‘wanton’ woman has been already
explained, and the prostitute also is an ‘unchaste woman.’

“As a matter of fact, only that woman is to be called ‘another’s wife,’
‘*paradāra*’ (in connection with the present context) who has
intercourse with the paternal or maternal relations of her husband; and
such women become known as ‘wanton,’ when they have intercourse with
several men.”

True; but to the prostitute also, the term ‘*svairiṇī*,’ ^(‘)wanton,’ is
applicable on the basis of her *wantonness or want of self-control*.

Hence in the case of these, there should he both, bathing along with
clothes, and also the giving of a water-jar.

In connection with adultery some people hold the following opinion—The
avoiding of sexual intercourse is of the nature of a *vow*, and as such
pertains, not to all men, but to the Accomplished Student; as it is in
reference to him that the texts have set forth the section beginning
with the words^(‘)now his vow,’ and ending with—^(‘)these vows he shall
keep.’—(176)

‘*On being solicited*’ by a man of equal caste,—if she happens to have
sexual intercourse again, then, inasmuch as this would be a ‘minor
offence,’ the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ would be the natural expiation for her.
Even so, the Cāndrāyaṇa has been mentioned again in the present verse,
in order to imply that the other expiations prescribed for ‘cow-killing’
(which is a typical ‘minor offence’) are not applicable in the present
case,—and also that the complete *Cāndrāyaṇa* has to be performed.

Though the latter half of the verse would seem to imply that
‘intercourse with all women apart from one’s own wife involves the same
expiation,’ yet as a matter of fact, such is not the case; as special
penalties have been laid down in connection with the following
women:—‘mother, mother’s sister, mother-in-law, maternal aunt, father’s
sister, wife of the paternal uncle, wife of a friend, wife of a pupil,
sister, sister’s friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, teacher’s wife, a
woman belonging to one’s own *gotra*, a woman-refugee, a queen, a
mendicant woman, a chaste woman, one’s nurse, a woman belonging to a
higher caste.’ From among these, as regards the mother, the proper
expiation has been already explained (under the ‘heinous offence’of
‘Violating the Preceptor’s Bed’);—in connection with those beginning
with the ‘mother’s sister’ and ending with ‘daughter,’ the expiation
shall he the performance of the *Kṛcchra* penance for one year;—and in
the case of the rest, the performance of *Cāndrāyaṇa*.

*Question*—“Those that have been mentioned here as belonging to the same
*gotra*,—does this mean those that are born in the same *gotra* as the
man? Or those that have been married to the same *gotra*?”

The answer to this is that both are meant; since we find texts
indicative of both views.

‘*Gotra*’ means *family, paternal line*; and if *women of the same
paternal line* be meant, then the separate mention of the ‘father’s
sister,’ would be superfluous, as she ‘belongs to the same paternal
line.’ If, on the other hand, the woman he held to be one who belongs to
the *gotra* of the person to whom she has been united, then they should
be spoken of as belonging to their husband’s *gotra*; and in that case,
the separate mention of the‘wife of the paternal uncle’ becomes
superfluous; as in the said sense she would he ‘of the same *gotra*’ as
the man concerned. Thus then, there being nothing to indicate which one
of these two views is meant, we take the term as referring to both. The
common view, however, is that what are meant here are women whose
husband’s *gotra* is the same as that of the man concerned.

Some people have hold that—“In connection with the performance of
Śrāddhas, women belong to their father’s *gotra*.” But this is
restricted to *Śrāddhas* only. Or, we may take it as referring to other
cases also, if we find a text, directly saying so.—(177)

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ here stands for the *Caṇḍālī*.

Since the expiation prescribed is a heavy one, it should be understood
as meant, for the act done intentionally and repeated twice. In other
cases the expiation would consist in the performance of the *Kṛcchra*
for one year.

Since the text contains the term ‘*for* *one night*,’ what is said here
must ho taken as referring to a man who sleeps with the woman and spends
the whole night with her.

‘*Dallying*’ means *enjoyment*.

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ has been used here as a deprecatory word, and not in
the sense of the particular caste (*Caṇḍāla*).

‘*What he commits*’—The sin that he brings on.

‘*That he wipes off in three years*’—destroys it.

‘*Lining on alms and constantly repeating sacred texts*.’—As no
particular texts have been specified, they say that the words repeated
should he expressive of his deed (?). Others, however, have held that
the words repeated shall bo, not ordinary ones, but those occurring in
the *Mantra* and *Brāhmaṇa* texts, to be selected according to the man’s
own predilections. That this is so follows from the fact that, where the
*repeating of the sacred texts of the Ṛg-Veda* has been prescribed (in
11.262) as a general moans of purification, no particular texts have
been specified.

Some people explain the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ as standing for the *Śūdra*
woman, and declare that dallying with her for three months is what is
meant.

But this cannot be right. Because marrying a Śūdra woman is not
permitted; and as for a wanton woman, the expiation in her case is a
light one; and intercourse with other kinds of Śūdra women would fall
under the category of ‘Minor Offences,’ for which the expiation laid
down in the present verse would be too heavy.—(178)

‘*Vṛṣalī*’—‘*Cāṇḍālī*’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘a Śūdra woman’

as *Cāṇḍālī*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 363), which says that this
lays down the expiation for the marrying of a *Śūdra girl, in a manner

The term ‘outcast’ connotes disqualification in regard to the rites of
twice-born men; the meaning is that he ‘falls,’ recedes, becomes
deprived of, his rights.

‘*Outcasts*,’—of the four castes, Brāhmaṇa and the rest;—‘*if one
associates with* them—*in one year he becomes an outcast*,’ he becomes
equal to the outcast.

What is it that he is supposed to do when ‘associating?’

‘*Walking, sitting and eating*’—(*a*) ‘walking’ means conversing,
touching the body and moving about in his company; similarly (*b*)
‘sitting,’ on the same bed, or on the same seat; and (*c*) ‘eating,’ on
the same seat, or out of the same dish.

‘*Sacrificing*, *teaching and forming matrimonial alliance*,’—it is with
these that ‘*not*’ has to be construed.

It becomes necessary to explain whether, by^(‘)sacrificing’ for an
outcast, one does not become an outcast at all, or he becomes so in more
or less than a year.

On the basis of other *Smṛti* -texts it is understood that by
sacrificing for an outcast, one becomes an outcast *immediately*.

The right reading would be^(‘)*yājanādhyāpanam*,’ with the Accusative
ending;—as the nouns are meant to be governed by the present-participle
term^(‘)*ācaran*,’ which also indicates the reason for what is here laid
down (for the purpose of the indication whereof the Ablative has been
used).—(180)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa explain the verse differently:—‘He who
associates with an outcast by sacrificing for him, or by forming a
matrimonial alliance with him, himself becomes an outcast after a year,
but not by using the same carriage or seat, or eating with
him’.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 849), which explains the
meaning as follows:—‘By associating with an outcast on conveyances,
seats and dinners after one year,—but by associating with him in
sacrificing, teaching and the like, he becomes an outcast, not after one
year, but immediately

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1087), which offers the following
explanation:—By associating in any way with a known outcast, himself
becomes an outcast; that is, becomes like him;—there are some acts in
which associating with the outcast makes one an outcast, irrespective of
all other considerations; and such acts are ‘sacrificing, teaching and
marrying’; each of these acts by itself makes the associator an
outcast;—the acts of going on the same conveyance, sitting together and
eating, on the other hand, do not by themselves make him an outcast;
they do so through other acts.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (8.261), as meaning that only such acts as
those of ‘travelling together and so forth’ make one an outcast by being
continued for one year;—it adds that ‘sitting’ includes ‘sleeping’ also.
It remarks that the passage is to be construed as
follows:—‘*Saṃvatsareṇa patati patitena sahācaran yānāsanāśanāt*’; and
‘*Yājanādhyāpanādyaunāt na tu saṃvatsareṇa patati, kintu sadya eva*’;
and concludes thus—‘By sacrificing and other acts the man becomes an
outcast at once, while by sleeping and other acts he becomes so only by
continuing it for one year’.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (pp. 149 and 156), which construes
‘*Yāṇāṣanāśanāt*’ as ‘*Yānasanāśanāt utpannam saṃyogam ācaran*’,—and
adds that these three, when done all together and intentionally, do
degrade the man.

by sacrificing for him, or teaching him, or forming a matrimonial

*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.22).—‘They quote the following:—“He who during a year
associates with an outcast becomes an outcast; not by sacrificing for
him, or teaching him, or forming a matrimonial alliance with him, but by
using the same carriage or seat.”’

*Gautama* (21, 3).—‘He who associates for a year with outcasts (becomes

*Viṣṇu* (35.3-5).—‘He who associates with an outcast becomes an outcast
himself after one year; and so does he who rides in the same carriage
with him, or who eats in his company, or who sits on the same bench, or
who lies on the same couch with him. Matrimonial intercourse,
sacrificial intercourse or vocal intercourse with an outcast entails
immediate loss of caste.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.261).—‘He who associates with these (outcasts) for one
year, himself becomes equal to them.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 1086).—‘If a man knowingly lives with an outcast
for one year, he becomes mingled with him, and at the end of the year,
becomes an outcast himself. Sacrificing for the outcast, forming
matrimonial connections with him, teaching him, eating with him,—doing
these one becomes an outcast immediately.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘Occupying the same seat or couch with an outcast,
sitting in the same line with him, mixing up one’s cooked food with his,
using the same vessels, sacrificing for him, teaching him, going on the
same conveyance with him, eating with him; these are the nine forms of
*association*; this should not he done with low men.’

*Parāśara* (Do., p. 1088).—‘The Brāhmaṇa unintentionally forming
connections with outcasts becomes equal to him, either in five days, or
ten days, or twelve days, or half-a-year, or one year.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

For the atonement of the sin of associating with an outcast, the same
expiation is to be performed which has been prescribed for that outcast
himself.

In ‘*eṣam*,’ ‘*of these*,’ the Genitive has the sense of *selection*;
the sense being—‘From among these outcasts, if a man associates with any
one,—in the manner described in the preceding verse,—he should perform
that same expiation which has been prescribed for that same outcast;—for
the purpose of purifying—removing—the sin begotten by that association.’

This last phrase ‘*for the purpose*, etc.,’ serves only to fill up the
metre.

As a rule, a man becomes *degraded* (an outcast) by repeatedly doing
such degrading acts as not renouncing the company of outcasts. Now there
arises the question—Does this mean that the *degradation*—the
*outcastness*—that attaches itself to the associating person is
direct,—or is it only the degradation of the outcast that becomes
attributed to him indirectly? If it is something new, then it behoves
you to point out the authority for the assertion that ‘there are *five
heinous offences*.’ If it be held that in the case of the five, the
degradation is *direct*, while in that of others it is *indirect*,—then
there would be no point in making any such distinction. The acts being
the same, the expiations being the same, what would be the use for
attributing the degradation in one case, only *indirectly*?

*Objection*—Some people argue as follows:—“Usage does not always vary
with purposes only, it varies on other grounds also. In the present case
the distinction is based upon authoritative texts: For instance, in a
case where, having asserted *degradation*, the text goes on to explain
it as consisting in being deprived of the rights of twice-born
men,—*e.g*., in 182 below,—as the character is mentioned as belonging to
the man himself, the *degradation* is *direct*; on the other hand, where
the character is spoken of—either by name or by indicative words,—as due
to relations with the outcast, it is *indirect*. For instance, in
connection with the names ‘*Saurya*’ and ‘*Āgneya*,’ no characteristic
of the terms ‘*Sūrya*’ and ‘*Agni*’ is found to have been declared as
belonging to the *Saurya* and the *Āgneya*, on the basis whereof there
could be any transference of details from one to the other, which could
bestow any peculiar character on them. (*Vide* Mīmāṃsa-Sūtra,
8.1.27-31).’

“This, however, is not right; because in the case cited, the terms
‘*Sūrya*’ and the rest are all-powerful, since they form part of the
Veda, which is not the work of an author. The present treatise on the
other hand, is the work of a human author, and how can any such author
propound a distinction which does not exist in fact? There may be some
kinds of distinction which may be admitted, when not opposed to
well-known Perception or Inference. \[But cannot justify the assuring of
distinctions in all cases.\] As for *repetition*, it means the doing of
an act twice over; and it is in this sense that the term is used, even
in cases where the act is repeated a hundred times; for in all cases,
the character of ‘repetition’ is one and the same. In ordinary parlance
also ‘repetition’ means only duplicating the act. So that whether an act
is *repeated* twice, or a hundred times, the expiation due to
‘repetition’ shall be one and the same, as what is forbidden is a
despicable deed; and whether a man sleeps twice during the day, or kills
a cow more than once,—the condition that there is repetition of a
despicable act is one and the same, which should lead to the same kind
of ‘degradation.’ For these reasons what is here propounded needs to be
pondered over—is open to doubt”

*Answer*—What is there that needs pondering over? That the five acts are
sinful, leading to degradation, has been declared by all writers on
*Smṛti*; as also that some other acts are similar to those five. There
is no gainsaying these two facts; as for distinction among these, it can
be made on the basis of ‘the capacity of the agent, the nature of the
offence,’ and so forth (set forth in Verse 209 below). It can never be
that what has been declared as *similar* to a certain act should stand
on the same footing as that act itself; for instance, the cow cannot be
the same as the *gavaya*. The fact of the matter is that on certain
points the two acts differ between themselves, while On others they
resemble, and hence come to be spoken of as ‘similar.’

From all this it follows that those also who are *equal* to outcasts
become ‘outcasts,’ themselves; and in this case the expiation would be
just a little less than that in the case of actual outcasts.

In connection with the question of being deprived of rights and
privileges, some people put forward the special points that the man
becomes deprived only of the right of performing the *Śrauta* rites, and
not the *Smārta* ones.

It has been argued above that there would be no difference between doing
an act twice and doing it a hundred times over. But as a matter of fact,
there would certainly be a difference among the various degrees of
repetition. How could the offence in both cases be of the same degree?

Another argument put forward is that—‘Sleeping during the day and
cow-killing, both being forbidden acts, there would be the same degree
of ‘degradation’ involved in the repeated committing of both these
deeds. But how can the deprecation of the two acts be said to be of the
same degree;—when, as a matter of fact, we find a distinction between
the degree of sinfulness clearly set forth in the corresponding
declamatory passages? And there is multiplicity of expiation also in
cases where the prohibition is exceptionally emphatic.

The rule on this point is this:—That there is ‘degradation’ brought
about by the repeated performance of forbidden acts is not true of all
forbidden acts s for instance Verse 11.41 has declared that the killing
of 1,000 animals of one kind is equal to that of a single animal of
another; hence in several cases, even though a certain forbidden act may
be repeated several times, there is no ‘degradation’ at all.—(181)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 851), which notes that in
all these cases the lightness or heaviness of the expiation will depend
upon the caste and capacity of the person concerned;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.261);—in *Parāśaramadhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 23), which defines
‘*saṃsarga*’ as travelling together, sitting together and so forth;—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 141 and 165), which says that this refers to
the *Mahāpātakas* only,—and that ‘*Patita*’ here stands for the mere
‘offender’ or ‘sinner’ (not literally, the *outcast*);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 356).

man, the latter shall perform the same penance as the former, but only
three quarters of it.’

months, through sacrificing, teaching and the like, or though occupying
the same seat or couch with him, he should perform half of that penance
which has been prescribed for that sinner.’

[\[See above,
9.201.\]]

*Gautama* (20.4-9).—‘A slave or a hired servant shall fetch an impure
vessel from a dust-heap, fill it with water taken from the pot of a
female slave and, his face turned towards the south, upset it with his
foot, pronouncing the sinner’s name and saying: “I deprive so-and-so of
water.” All the kinsmen shall touch the slave, passing their sacred
thread over the right shoulder and under the left arm, and untying the
look on their heads. The spiritual teachers and the marriage-relatives
shall look on. Having bathed, they shall enter the village. He who
afterwards unintentionally speaks to the outcast shall stand, during one
night, repeating the *Gāyatrī*. If he converses with him intentionally,
he must perform the same penance for three nights.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.36).—‘Now the relatives shall empty (the water-pot of
a grievous offender) at a solemn meeting (and he shall confess), “I, N.
N., am (the perpetrator of) such and such (a deed).” After (the outcast)
has performed (his penance), the Brāhmaṇas shall ask him who has touched
water, milk, clarified butter, honey, and salt, “Hast thou performed
(the penance)?” The other (person) shall answer, ‘Om’ (yes)!’ They shall
admit him who has performed (a penance) to all sacrificial rites, making
no difference (between him and others).’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (15.12-16).—‘A slave, or the son of a low-caste woman, or a
relative not belonging to the same caste who is destitute of good
qualities, shall fetch a broken jar from a heap of useless rubbish,
place *Kuśa* grass with its top lopped off on *Lohita* grass on the
ground, and empty the jar with his left foot; and the relatives,
allowing their hair to hang down, shall touch the man who empties the
jar. Turning their left hands towards the spot, they may go home at
pleasure. After that they should not admit the outcast to sacred rites.
Those who admit him to sacred rites become equal to him.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.294).—‘The female slave and the relatives shall pour
the jarful of water outside the village for the outcast; and they shall
exclude him from all functions.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.57).—‘On the death-day of an outcast, a female slave of his
must upset a jar with water with her feet.’

‘*As in the case of the dead*’— This is an injunction of what should be
done (in the case of the dead).

The female slave shall overturn with her foot the water-jar,
saying—‘This is for so and so’ (naming the outcast).

After this has been done, it is necessary to observe ‘un-cleanliness’
during the day and night.

‘*Along with the relations*’— They shall all sit in one place, for that
day.

The naming of the ‘*female slave*’ indicates that the *Sapiṇḍas* should
not do it themselves.

“If that be so, and the Sapiṇḍas do not do this act themselves, what
should be the difference between ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’ and ‘*relations*,’ in view
of which it has been said that all this should be done in the presence
of relations, priests and elders? Since all (*Sapiṇḍas* as well as
*Relations*) would be helping the offering only by their *presence*, and
thus acting like an indirect accessory.”

It is not so; ‘*Sapiṇḍas*’ and others of that class are the ‘performers’
of the act of offering in the sense that it is they that *direct* it;
while ‘Relations,’ ‘priests’ and the rest are brought together only with
a view to some spiritual effect.—(183)

‘*The additional share of property due to the eldest*.’—In connection
with this, the following objection is raised:—“The declaration that all
property shall be withheld from him clearly implies the withholding also
of the additional share due to the eldest”

In answer to this some people explain that the said *withholding* is
reiterated in the present verse, for the purpose of laying down that the
said share shall devolve upon the younger brother who excels him in
quality.

Others however think that the term ‘Property’ stands for all kinds of
wealth, not for the *hereditary* property only; as in the lexicon we
find ‘*dāyādya*’ (which is the word used in the preceding verse)
mentioned as a synonym for ‘*dhana*’, ‘property.’ Hence what is meant by
the withholding of ‘property’ from him means that one may not pay to him
what may have been borrowed from him; what the debtor should do is to
repay the same to the man’s son, brother or other heirs.

Others again hold that the withholding of ‘property’ is meant to apply
to the case where the property has not been previously divided, while
what is meant by the present verse is that if division has already taken
place, all that shall be taken away from him is only the additional
share that he may have received by virtue of his being the eldest
brother; so that even though the man may have sons, they shall inherit
all the rest of his property, save the said additional share.—(185)

The present verse describes what sort of water-offering is to be made
for one who has performed the prescribed penance.

‘*They shall bathe with him in a reservoir of water*,’—in a sacred
river, or in a large lake, or in some such sacred place as Prabhāsa,
Mānasa and the like;—‘*and throw a fresh jar full of water*.’

Since the present text speaks of the ‘fresh jar’ and the foregoing one
speaks of the ‘female slave,’ it means that in the former case, the jar
to be used should be one that has been already in use for other
purposes. In both cases the jar is to be filled with water.—(186)

his kinsmen shall fill a golden vessel with water from a very holy lake

that vessel, and he, after taking it, shall recite the following

they shall not despise him, and they shall associate with him in all

*Vaśiṣṭha* (15.17-20).—‘Outcasts who have performed the prescribed
penance may be re-admitted. Those who strike their teacher, mother or

golden or an earthen vessel with water from a sacred lake or river, they
pour it over him reciting three sacred texts.’

This ‘water-rite’ is to be performed only in the case of the ‘outcast’
referred to in the present context, and not to other kinds of

‘*This same method is to be adopted in the case of female outcasts*,’—of
women who have become outcasts.

Even in the case of such female outcasts as have not performed the
expiation, and to whom ‘water’ has been offered, in the manner of a dead
person,—food and clothing shall be supplied. Inasmuch as the text uses
the word ‘*dāna*,’ what is meant is that she is to receive just enough
food and clothing to keep her body, and she shall not be supplied with
any articles of luxury.

‘*Drink*’— From the very propriety of the case, this stands for *water*.
But, even if it was not supplied, she could get it in any quantities.
What is meant therefore by its mention is that the man supplying her
with it shall not do it in an affectionate manner.

Food and clothing also should be of the same inferior quality as the
drink. Says *Yājñavalkya* (1.70)—‘One should deprive the unchaste woman
of her rights, let her remain dirty, living on mere morsel of food,
despised, and sleeping on the ground.’

The conditions that render women ‘outcasts’ are the same as those in the
case of men. As for what has been said in connection with those who
procure abortions—‘in cases of abortion, the woman does not incur a
heavier guilt—etc., etc.’ what this means is only that both the man and
the woman are equally guilty, and it does not mean that in cases other
than this, the woman incurs a heavier guilt. Says Yājñavalkya
(3.298)—‘Intercourse with inferior men, abortion, and injuring the
husband are to be regarded as acts that degrade (render outcasts) women
in particular.’

‘*They shall live close to the house*’—What is meant by the phrase
‘close to the house’ is that they shall be turned out of the main
building and allowed to live in a separate hut.

Some people say that lodging close to the house is to be given to only
those who are performing the expiation, and not for others.

But this is not right. Because what is really meant is that the
supplying of food and clothing would be easier if she dwelt close by.
While during the time that she is undergoing the expiation, she would be
living on alms, or milk, or performing the *Cāndrāyaṇa* and other
penances. And the rule regarding living on alms cannot be regarded as
set aside by what is said in the present text; as the only purpose
served by the present text is to prescribe the means of subsistence.

From all this it follows that what the verse means is that food and
clothing, etc., have to be supplied also to that female outcast who,
either though incapacity or on account of some other cause, is not in a
position to perform the expiatory penance.—(188)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.260), which explains that this
prescribes the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance,’ halved in consideration of the
sex of the offender;—and that in reference to an *unintentioned*
offence.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 99).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Āparārka, p. 1208).—‘Four kinds of women must be entirely
abandoned: One who has intercourse with her husband’s pupil, one who has
intercourse with her Guru, one who has killed her husband, and one who
has intercourse with a despicable person.’

‘*Refugee*’—He who, on being harassed by his enemies, or struck by some
powerful person, seeks refuge with a person saying ‘save me,’—or a man
who has committed an offence and comes to a learned man saying—‘save me,
tell me what expiation I should perform.’ Both these would be
‘refugees.’

‘*Ungrateful men*’—Those who forget the benefit that has been conferred
upon them by some one, and try to injure him,—or one who spoils the
effect of the benefit he has himself conferred upon some one, and tries
to undo it by doing him harm. Though both these men would be
‘*kṛtaghna*’ in the literal sense, yet in ordinary usage the name is
applied to one who causes injury to his benefactor.

In this connection, there is no consideration of caste,—the only
condition is that the persons murdered are^(‘)children’ and the like.

‘*Women*’—Even though they be unchaste. Though in these cases the
expiation shall be light, yet association with them is directly
forbidden by the words of the text.

‘*Association*’—Keeping company, living together.—(190)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1209), which remarks that the
phrase ‘*viśuddhānapi dharmataḥ*’ clearly indicates that the expiations
laid down in connection with the murder of women and other crimes do
really serve to remove the sin involved.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 155), as indication
of the view that in the case of heinous crimes, even after the
prescribed expiration has been gone through, the offender is not fit for
being associated with, even though for all spiritual purposes he may
have become ‘purified’;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 21);—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 109), which explains ‘*na saṃvaset*’ to mean

The time for the Brāhmaṇa’s Initiation has been laid down as extending
up to the sixteenth year of his age; and the present text lays down the
expiation for transgressing this limit.

If to a Brāhmaṇa the *Sāvitrī* has not been taught—from the seventh to
the sixteenth year of his age—the ‘*teaching of the Sāvitrī*’ stands
here for the sacrament of *Initiation*; hence the meaning is ‘if the
Initiation has not been performed at the said time’; similarly up to the
twenty-second year for the Kṣatriya, and the twenty-fourth year for the
Vaiśya,—then after the lapse of this time, he should be made to perform
three ‘*Kṛcchra*’ penances. Where the term ‘Kṛcchra’ stands without an
epithet, it means the *Prājāpatya* penance,—such is the well-known usage
of *Smṛti*.

Others explain the ‘*Kṛcchra*’ here as standing for the
*Kṛcchātikṛcchra*.

After these *Kṛcchra* penances have been performed, he should be
initiated.

‘*In due form*’— This is purely reiterative.—(191)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 433), as
laying down the expiation for the ‘*Vrātya*’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
871), which adds that—(*a*) in the case of the omission being due to the
absence of an initiator, the expiation should he that prescribed by Manu
and Yājñavalkya, and (*b*) in the case of omission being due to no such
unavoidable circumstances, nor in times of digress, it should be ‘Three
Years’ Penance’ prescribed under the section on cow-slaughter.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1107), which explains ‘*trīn kṛcchrān*’
as meaning—(1) The *Prājāpatya*, (2) the *Kṛcchra* and (3) the
*Atikṛcchra*;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as laying down what should be done

been repeated, nor the other ceremonies performed, as the law directs,
must be made to perform three *Prājāpatya* penances and then initiated
according to custom.’

*Āpastamba* (1.1.28-29).—‘If the proper time for initiation has passed,
he shall observe, for the space of two months, the duties of a Student,
as observed by those who are studying the three Vedas; after that he may
be initiated; and after that he may be instructed.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.76-78).—‘A man who has missed the *Sāvitrī* may undergo
the *Uddālaka* penance. Let him subsist, during two months, on
barley-gruel, during one month on milk, during half a month on curds,
during eight days on clarified butter, during six days on alms given
without asking, and during three days on water; and let him fast for one

the livelihood that has been prescribed for him; occupations other than

‘*Abandoned by the Veda*’— those who, though *initiated*, have not
studied the Veda,—or having studied have forgotten it.

‘*Objectionable*’— Though the text uses this general term, it should be
understood as standing for the ‘accepting of improper gifts,’ because
what the next verse lays down refers to the particular means of
acquiring property; what is said is that ‘the man becomes absolved from
the sin of accepting an improper gift.’

‘*Giving it up*’—Relinquishing; renouncing all sense of ownership with
regard to it, or actually giving it away. Unmindful of any spiritual or
temporal benefits that might accrue from the relinquishment, he should
deposit, the property on the public road, saying—‘anyone who wishes may
take this from me’;—or he may throw it away into a river or a pit. or in
some such place.

The exact forms of the ‘repeating of sacred texts’ and ‘austerities’ are
going to be described in the verse referred to above.

Others lead ‘*mānavāḥ*’ (‘men’) in place of ‘*Brāhmaṇāḥ*,’ and explain
the verse as follows:—Any means of acquiring property that has been
forbidden for a man—be he a twice-born or Śūdra—is ‘*objectionable*’ for
him. *E.g*., it has been declared that—‘The Brāhmaṇa or the Kṣatriya
shall not take interest’
([10.117]).
For one who earns wealth by such means, the expiation consists of
‘giving up,’ ‘repeating of texts’ and ‘austerities,’ all three combined.
In the ease of the Brāhmaṇa accepting an improper gift, however, there
is a special expiation as described in the following verse.—(193)
</details>

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 49);—in *Aparārka* (p. 1150);—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.290), which adds that this surrendering should be done in every ease
before the performance of the expiation specially prescribed for the
act;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 925), which notes that ‘*japyena*’ refers
to the 300 repetitions of the *Sāvitrī* laid down in the next verse;—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 222), which says that, this clearly implies
that the religious act, that the man does with the ill-gotten wealth
also becomes vitiated to that extent;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 403
and 415);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 165a), to the effect when a
man acquires property by methods not sanctioned by the scriptures, he
does not obtain any legal possession of that property, and hence his
sons also have no claims to inherit that, property.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

’*Apostates*’—Those who have fallen off from the *Sāvitrī*; for such
men, (*a*) if one performs the *Vrātyastoma*—which is a rite specially
prescribed for them,—either by officiating at it as a priest or by
directing it;—(*b*) or if he performs the ‘*obsequies*’— the rites
performed in the cremation-grounds—‘*for strangers*’—*i.e*., for persons
other than their parents or preceptor;—(*c*) or if he performs
‘*malevolent rites*’—such as the *Śyenacit* sacrifice and the like;—or
(*d*) if he performs the *Ahīna*. sacrifice;—he becomes pure by
performing ‘*three Kṛcchras*.’

Others hold that what is here laid down does not refer to the
*performer* of the ‘malevolent’ or ‘Ahīna’ sacrifices, but to those who
officiate as priests at these sacrifices. It is for this reason that
this same rule applies also to those who perform sacrifices for
apostates. As regards the performer himself, since he undertakes the
performance in obedience to the Vedic injunction of the sacrifices
concerned, how could they be liable to expiation for their act, so long
as the performance has not been forbidden?

“As regards the *Ahīna* sacrifice, it is possible that it may have been
undertaken in obedience to a Vedic injunction; but how can the same be
said regarding the *Śyena* and other malevolent rites? There is no such
injunction as that ‘one should kill his enemies’; all that the Veda says
is that—‘if one desires to encompass the death of his enemy, he should,
for that purpose, perform the Śyena and such malevolent rites.’ And to
the killing of an enemy one is prompted solely by impetuous desire, and
the entertaining of such desire has been forbidden, by such texts
as—‘one should not seek to injure any living creature.’ To the
performance of the *Ahīna* sacrifices also people are prompted solely by
impetuous desire; as only such people are entitled to it as entertain an
eager desire for a definite reward;—but (there is this difference that)
in this case neither the desire for the particular reward nor the action
leading up to that reward is one that is forbidden. While in the other
case in question (that of the Malevolent Rites), both are forbidden: as
the general prohibition ‘one should not injure living creatures’ means
that ‘one shall undertake an act that leads up to the death of a living
creature’; and it is such *death* which forms the result of the *Śyena*
and other malevolent rites. As regards the *Ahīna* on the other hand,
there is no such prohibition as that—^(‘)one should not undertake an act
that leads to heaven.’”

In answer to this, some people offer the following explanation:—It
having been declared (11.33) that ‘speech is the Brāhmaṇa’s weapon,’ the
encompassing of the death of an enemy by means of malevolent rites,
becomes sanctioned by it. So that the Ahīna and the Malevolent Rite
stand upon the same footing.

Thus then an expiation would appear to be necessary only for the priest
officiating at these sacrifices (and not for the *sacrificer* himself).

“As a matter of fact all acts done with a purpose have been forbidden by
the general text—selfishness is deprecated’ (2.2).”

What this text means we have explained under that verse itself.

As a matter of fact, in connection with the *Ahīna*, there may he some
Vedic texts sanctioning the act of officiating at it. As regards the
Malevolent Rite on the other hand, there is impropriety on the part of
the *sacrificer* also; as is indicated by such texts as—‘Those who kill
by means of the Jyotiṣ, etc., etc.’; and it is for this reason that
expiations also have been prescribed in this connection.

So far as the present verse is concerned however, it can he taken as
referring to the priests officiating at the Malevolent Rite.

‘*Malevolent Rite*,’ ‘*abhicāra*’ is the name given to the encompassing
of an enemy’s death by means of the repeating of sacred texts and the
offering of oblations, prescribed in the Veda.—(197)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 383);—in *Aparārka* (p.
1152), which explains ‘*antya karma*’ as the ‘*antyeṣṭi*,’ and adds that
this refers to one who does the acts on hire, and not merely with a
religious motive; and that it refers to the Brāhmaṇa who performs the
death-rites for the Kṣatriya and other castes;—the ‘*Ahīna*’ is the name
for all those *Ahargaṇa* sacrifices which begin with the ‘*Dvirātra*’
and end with the ‘*Dvādaśarātra*.’

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 429), as laying down
the expiation for officiating at sacrifices performed by those who
should not perform them;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 917), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Antya karma*,’ the rites performed on the
cremation ground,—‘*pareṣām*,’ *non-sapiṇḍas* or *śūdras*,—in the case
of the former it is repetition that is reprehensible, and in that of the
latter, even the first act;—‘*abhicāra*,’ ‘murderous rite,’ is
reprehensible, when it is performed against one who has not done any
similar act against the man;—the ‘*Ahīna*’ is a particular kind of
sacrifice.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 122);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 247), which says that, as ‘*hīna*’ means ‘unrighteous,’ ‘*ahīna*’
means ‘righteous,’ and hence what is forbidden is ‘magical rites against
righteous persons.’

**(verses 11.197-198)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (54.25).—‘He who has knowingly offered a sacrifice for an
unworthy person, he who has performed the funeral rites for a stranger,
he who has practised magic rites, and he who has performed sacrifices of
the *Ahīna* class,—all these may rid themselves of their sin by
performing three *Kṛcchra* penances.’

*Āpastamba* (1.26.7).—‘He who has been guilty of conduct unworthy of an
Aryan, of calumniating others, of actions contrary to the rules of
conduct, of eating or drinking forbidden things, of connection with a
woman of the Śūdra caste, of an unnatural crime, of performing magic
rites, shall bathe and sprinkle himself with water, reciting the seven
verses addressed to *Apas*, or those addressed to Varuṇa,......... in
proportion to the frequency with which the crime has been committed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.289).—‘One who performs sacrifices for an Apostate, one
who performs magic rites for encompassing the death of some person, one
who misuses the Veda, or one who abandons a person who has sought his
protection, should perform three *Kṛcchra* penances and subsist upon
barley for one year.’

The ‘*refugee*’ is of two kinds, as described above (under
190),—‘*abandoning*’—discarding of him, if one is able to afford him
protection (is sinful). This has been discussed before.

‘*Tampered with the Veda*’—(*a*) Has studied it on a day on which it
should not be studied;—or (*b*) has interfered with a man who is reading
it in the correct form, by telling him some such tiling as—‘What are you
reading?—You have mangled the text,’—or (*c*) through greed for wealth
recites it, without being invited to do so. The Smṛti has declared
that—‘by reciting the Veda for gain one becomes degraded, says
Manu.’—(198)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Vedam viplāvya*.’—‘Having taught the Veda to people who should not be
taught’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Nandana);—‘having wrongly
interpreted the Veda or perverted its sense by omitting *anusvāras*
etc.’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘having intentionally forgotten the Veda’
(Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 918), which adds the
following notes:—If the man abandons one who comes to him seeking safety
from some danger, or for the prescription of an expiation,—‘*Vedam
viplāvya*,’ *i.e*., reading it within hearing of the Cāṇḍāla or other
snob persons, or on days unfit for study.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1152), to the effect that when a man
comes to one in the hope of obtaining shelter for his life, and the
latter, though capable of saving him, refuses to do so,—similarly one
who reads the Veda from an improper person, or in an improper place, or
at an improper time,—or learns it from or teaches it to an unqualified
person,—both these should live on barley for one year.

text, (b) the ‘Sākala Homa’ and (c) eating at the sixth meal-time;—all
three combined.

The ‘*Sākala Homa*’ is that which is offered with wooden sticks (?) and

‘*Daily*.’—This has been added in older to show that even after the

On ‘*passing*’ these, one should bathe ‘*in his clothes*’—the clothes in

The duties laid down in the Veda are—(a) the *Śrauta* sacrifices,
*Darśapūrṇamāsa* and the rest and (b) the *Smārta* rites of the Twilight
Prayers and the rest. These latter also are regarded as ‘laid down in
the Veda,’ because *Smṛtis* have their source in the Veda.

‘*The observances of the Accomplished Student*’—*e.g*., ‘He shall not
wear over-worn or dirty clothes’ and so forth.

If these are omitted, the offender should fast for one day.

In connection with the omission of the *Śrauta* rites, some sacrifices
have been prescribed by way of expiation; and with these the ‘fasting’
here prescribed is to be combined.

The syllable ‘*hum*’ is uttered as a sign of anger and insult; *e.g*.,
in such expressions as—‘Keep quiet, hum! don’t speak like this’ and so
forth;—the syllable ‘*hum*’ being uttered by way of a prohibition.

‘*Against a Brāhmaṇa*,’—be he older, or equal or younger, a pupil or a
son.

Similarly—‘*if he addresses a superior person as* “*Thou*,”’—*e.g*.,
‘Thou sayest so,’ ‘thou didst this.’

The expiation here laid down is for the use of the singular form of the
pronoun ‘*Yuṣmat*’; and no significance is meant to be attached to the
special Nominative-ending (in the term ‘*tvam*’ here used). In actual
usage, speaking to their superiors, people make use of such forms as
‘*Yuṣmāsu*’ the Plural form (in the Locative).

‘*Should bathe and fast*’—which moans the dropping of the morning-meal.

‘*Having saluted*’—fallen on his feet,—‘he shall *propitiate him*’—make
him give up his anger—and then take his meal.—(204)

For those wrongful deeds for which no expiation has been
prescribed,—*e.g*., the killing of men belonging to the mixed castes of
the reverse order, such as the *Caṇḍāla* and the like,—‘one shall fix
the expiation.’

“In the present work itself, it has been declared that—‘for killing
animals with bones, one may give something to a Brāhmaṇa’ ([Verse
141]);
and this should include the *Caṇḍāla* and others.”

In that verse, inasmuch as the said animals are spoken of along with
‘boneless animals,’ it follows that only very small animals are meant;
and what is there laid down cannot, apply to animals with very large
bodies (such as human beings, etc.).

“It having been declared that there are only *four castes*, and no
*fifth* one, the *Caṇḍāla* and other inversely mixed castes should all
fall under the ‘Śūdra.’”

Simply because there is no *fifth caste*, it does not follow that the
men in question must be *Śūdras*. Since everyone of these has a distinct
characteristic of his own. For instance, ‘the Śūdra is born of a Śūdra
father from a married wife of the same caste,’ while the others in
question are all born of *mixtures of castes*. Consequently the
expiation for the killing of these cannot he the same as that for the
killing of a *Śūdra*. Nor could it he met by the ‘giving away of
something to a Brāhmaṇa.’

‘*Capacity*’— of the offender to perform penances; *i.e*., it shall he
considered whether the man is capable of performing a *penance* or
making *gifts*.

‘*Nature of the offence*’—that is, for *causing injury to living
creatures*, it shall he the expiation definitely prescribed for that
offence; similarly for *eating improper food*; and so forth. Similarly
the relative heaviness or lightness of the offence should also be taken
into consideration.

“How can the *heaviness* or *lightness* of a certain offence be
determined *?* If it be held that it could be determined by the
heaviness of the expiation prescribed for it,—then, it has to be borne
in mind that what is asserted here refers to offences in connection with
which no expiations have been prescribed.”

True; but an offence would be recognised as *heavy* when the declamatory
passage in connection with it would be found to speak of grave evils
attending it; as also when it would be found to be committed
intentionally.

Further, the present text does not necessarily refer to only such
offences as have no expiations prescribed for them. In fact, in other
cases also the exact expiation shall he determined by considerations
here set forth.

“How do you get at this?”

We deduce this from the fact that *Expiation* and *Punishment* stand on
the same footing; and in connection with Punishments, the said
considerations have been held to apply to the cases in connection with
which definite punishments have been laid down, as well as those in
connection with which no punishments have been definitely prescribed.
Further, inasmuch as the texts have all along spoken of the comparative
heaviness and lightness of offences, the determining of the exact
expiation must depend upon the said considerations. For these reasons it
follows that what, is here stated applies to all cases—those in
connection with which special expiations have been prescribed, as also
those in connection with which they have not been prescribed.—(209)

Though it is the opening of the day that is called ‘*morning*,’ yet here
the term stands for the *forenoon*.

This rule regarding eating *in the morning* precludes eating at random.
It is only at midday that such random meals could be obtained unasked
from people who would offer such meals in accordance with the rule that
‘gifts to men shall be made at midday.’ If this could be laid down as to
he done in the *morning*, then the midday meal would be precluded, but
not the evening meal. Thus between the two optional meals—of the morning
and the midday—if one of them is further emphasised, the other becomes
excluded. And this would be only right, since it is a penance that is
prescribed here;—taking a single meal during the day having been
mentioned among ‘penances.’ And it is also a ‘*tapas*,’ an austerity, in
the sense that it *causes inconvenience*, ‘*tāpayati*.’ If the second
meal were to be precluded, it would be the evening meal that would be
so.

Others have held that when the text says that one should have
sacrificial food in the morning,’ what is meant is that only *a small
quantity* of food shall be taken. Because people who are in the habit of
an early breakfast have only a light meal in the morning, and when the
man hikes his meal only when the cooking has been finished, he is said
to be an ‘ordinary eater.’

‘*In the evening*’—during the next three days.

After that, for three days, he is to live upon ‘sacrificial food’; since
writers on Smṛti have declared that—‘Having oaten a little one should
retiro to rest.’ In the case of eating ‘*food got unasked*,’ also, the
food shall consist of ‘sacrificial food’ and shall be taken once only.
In one’s own house also, when food is obtained by ordering the servants
to ‘fetch food,’—it is food got *after asking* (not ‘unasked’), as
‘asking’ stands for any form of *request*, and is equally applicable to
*orders* and *requests* also. So that in one’s own house also the man
shall eat only that which his wife and others bring to him without his
asking for it,—and not anything else.—(211)

*Gautama* (26.1-5).—‘Now we shall describe the *Kṛcchras*. During three
days, he shall eat at the morning-meal, sacrificial food, and fast in
the evening. Next he shall eat sacrificial food during another period of
three days, in the evening. Next, during another period of three days,
he shall not ask anything for food. Next, he shall fast during another
period of three days.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.238).—‘Eating during three days in the morning only,
during the next three days in the evening only, subsisting during
another three days on food given unasked, and fasting during three
days,—that is a *Kṛcchra* penance.’

Do. (4.5.6-7).—‘The *Kṛcchra* penance revealed by Prajāpati lasts twelve
days, which are divided into four separate periods of three days; during
the first period of three days, he eats in the day-time only; during the
second, at night only; during the third, he subsists on food given
without asking; and during the fourth, he lives on air. If one eats one
day in the morning only, and on the following day at night only; on the
next day, food given without asking; and on the fourth day, subsists on
air, and repeats this three times,—that is called *the Kṛcchra penance
of children*.’

*Āpastamba* (1.27.7).—‘The rule for the *Kṛcchra* penance of twelve days
is the following:—For three days he must not eat in the evening, and
then for three days, not in the morning; for three days he must live on
food given unasked; and for three days he must not eat anything.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21.20).—‘During three days, he eats in the daytime only; and
during the next three days, at night only; he subsists during another
period of three days, on food offered without asking; and finally, he
fasts during three days. That is a *Kṛcchra* penance.’

*Viṣṇu* (46.10).—‘Let a man for three days eat in the evening only; for
another three days in the morning only; for further three days, food
given unsolicited; and let him fast entirely for three days;—that is the
*Prājāpatya*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.320).—‘When the *Pāda-Kṛcchra* is in some way repeated

Having fasted on the fourteenth day, on the next day, or the Full
moon-day, he shall take fifteen morsels; the exact measure of the
‘morsel’ in this connection should be understood to be as mentioned in
another *Smṛti* (Gautama, 27.10), the words ‘*āpyāyasra*...... the
measure of the *morsel* being the quantity that does not distort the
face.’ As all the *Smṛtis* deal with the same subject, they should be
taken as mutually complementary, so long as there is no inconsistency;
and in cases of inconsistency, the two views should he taken as optional
alternatives.

Beginning with the first again, be shall reduce his food by one morsel
each day,—taking fourteen morsels on the first, thirteen on the second,
and so on, till on the fourteenth he takes only one morsel. Then having
fasted on the New-moon day (the fifteenth), he shall cat only one morsel
on the first, two on the second, and so on increasing it by one morsel
everyday, till it comes to fifteen on the Full-moon day.

‘*Upaspṛśan*’—bathing.

‘*At the three extractions*’—*i.e*., in the morning, at midday and in
the evening. This precludes the general rule that ‘the man shall bathe
thrice during the night,’—the present being a special rule.—(216)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 240), as
laying down the ‘three times bathing’ as part of the ‘*Cāndrāyāṇa*’
penance;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 742), where ‘*triṣavaṇam*’ is explained
as the three ‘*sandhyās*’, morning, evening and mid-day;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 1243), which adds that this penance is called ‘barley-shaped’ and
‘ant-shaped’, the latter when it is begun on the first day of the darker
fortnight;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 516).

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.45).—‘On the first day of the dark half of the month, let
him eat fourteen mouthfuls, and diminish the number by one daily, till
the end of the fortnight; in like manner, let him eat one mouthful on
the first day of the light half of the month and daily increase the
number by one, till the end of the fortnight.’

Do. (27.21).—‘Let him add daily one mouthful to his food during the
bright half of the month, let him diminish it daily by one mouthful
during the dark half, and let him fast on the moonless day; that is the
rule for the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.’

*Parāśara* (10.2).—(Same as Manu.)

*Gautama* (27.12-13).—‘On the full-moon day, he shall eat fifteen
mouthfuls, and during the dark half of the month daily diminish his
portion by one mouthful; he shall fast on the moonless day, and during
the bright half of the month daily increase his portion by one mouthful.
According to some, it should be the other way. That is a month occupied
by the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance.’

*Baudhāyana* (3.8, 19-27; also, 4.517).—‘On the first day of the latter
half of the month, he eats fourteen mouthfuls; thus he takes every day
one mouthful less, up to the moonless day; on the moonless day there is
not even a mouthful to be taken; on the first day of the first half of
the month one mouthful may be eaten, on the second, two; thus he daily
increases his meal by one mouthful up to the full-moon day. On the
full-moon day, he makes an offering to Agni and to other deities... and
then gives a cow to a Brāhmaṇa. This is the *Ant-shaped Cāndrāyaṇa*. If
it is performed in the reverse order it is the *Barley-shaped
Cāndrāyaṇa*. A sinner who has performed either of these becomes free
from all mortal sins.’

*Viṣṇu* (47.1-6).—‘Now follows the *Cāndrāyāṇa*:—Let a man eat single
mouthfuls of food, unchanged in size; and let him, during the moon's
increase, add successively one mouthful every day; and during the wane
of the moon, let him take off one mouthful every day; and on the
moonless day, let him fast entirely. This is the *Barley-shaped
Cāndrāyaṇa*. The *Cāndrayaṇa* is called *Ant-shaped* when the moonless
day is placed in the middle, add it is called *Barley-shaped* when the
full moon day is placed in the middle.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.323).—‘When one is performing the *Cāndrāyaṇa*, during
the bright half of the month, one should increase daily, by one, the
number of food-morsels, each of which is of the size of the peacock’s
egg; and during the dark half, he shall reduce it daily by one.’

All the gods have performed this penance, ‘*for deliverance from all
evils*.’

What this means is that this penance is to be performed, not only in
connection with the offences specified above, but in other cases also;
as it has been declared (by Gautama, 19.20)—‘The Kṛcchra, the Ātikṛcchra
and the Cāndrāyaṇa constitute the ‘*universal expiation*.’

In this connection there arises the question—“When the text speaks of
the *universal expiation*, does it mean that a single performance of
these atones for all sins? Or that they are to be repeated with each
sin?”

The answer to this is as follows:—The reasonable view would be that the
effect (in the shape of the expiation) should be repeated with the cause
(the sin); but what the assertion in question refers to are those sins
in regard to each of which no specific expiation has been prescribed, or
those whose commitment may be only suspected, and not definitely
ascertained;—now when the atonement is meant to be for such sins as are
only suspected to have been committed,—when for instance, one is
performing the *Kṛcchra* in accordance with what has been declared (in
Manu, 5.21) to the effect that ‘for the atonement of unknown sins one
should perform the *Kṛcchra* at least once a year,’—inasmuch as the
cause (the sin) would be uncertain, how could there be any repetition of
the expiation with each individual offence? For instance, when one is
turning his sides during sleep, he may kill several small creatures on
the bed, or when he is walking on the road, he may look at the face of
several women, till he reaches home;—in such cases the only right view
could be that one performance of the expiation should atone for all
these several offences. This has been explained by us under the text,
dealing with the expiation for the killing of ‘boneless creatures’
(140), where it has been shown that there is a single expiation for all
the offences collectively. When, however, the offences concerned are
grave ones,—we find distinct expiation prescribed in connection with
each. But what Gautama has prescribed can apply to only such
(unspecified) cases as have been mentioned above; and as the expiation
is a heavy one, it would not he reasonable to prescribe it except in the
case of repetitions. In the case of a number of suspected sins also, if
no other definite offence intervenes, it would be only right to regard
the single performance of the expiation as atoning for the whole lot of
them. The following passage also shows that a single performance should
do for a number of offences—‘Whatever sin I may have committed during
the night and during the day, what I may have done while I was awake and
while I was sleeping, etc., etc.,’—when the repetition of the term
‘*what*’ has been taken to mean that all the sins are atoned for
collectively.—(221)

What is here prescribed is to be done in connection with all offences.

In the case of all Homa-offerings, clarified butter is the material to
be offered, whenever any other special substance is not prescribed.

‘*Himself*.’—This precludes the alternative of having it performed by
others.

Now we proceed to consider the question whether or not this offering is
to be made in the *ordinary* fire, in the case of one who has not set up
his own ritualistic fire. But first of all the question to be considered
is why the offering should be made into a *fire* at all. What the name
‘*Homo*’ etymologically indicates is only the act of *offering* ending
with the *throwing* of the material; so that into whatever receptacle
the material may be thrown, the act of ‘*Homa*’ would be duly
accomplished. Hence the Homa-offering may be made either on the ground,
or in water or in fire. But for one who has set up the ‘domestic fire’
this offering shall not be made into the *ordinary* fire; as the
offering of *Homa* in ordinary fires has been forbidden for such a man.
It might be argued that—‘the necessity of fire is deduced from actual
usage.’ But in that-case, it would be necessary to find out what the
actual usage is. The authors of *Gṛhyasūtras* have laid down the Homa as
to be offered, in connection with the performance of the *Kṛcchra*
penance,⁻ by persons who have set up the ‘domestic fire,’ and from this
it follows that in the case also of one who has. not set up the fire,
the performance of the *Kṛcchra* by way of penance cannot be done with
out the *Homa-offering*. For the man who has not set up the fire, there
are no Homa-offerings, when the said penance is performed *for* *the
purpose of bringing about prosperity* (and not by way of an
expiation);—the desired result being obtained only by the performance of
the act itself complete in its own details.

‘*Harmlessness*.’—He shall not beat even such pupils and others who may
deserve chastisement.

‘*Truthfulness*.’—Even in joke, he shall not utter an untruth.

These two virtues, already known as conducive to the welfare of men, are
here laid down as forming essential factors in the expiatory penance.

‘*Ārjava*’ is absence of harshness.—(222)

During the night also, he shall bathe at the three ‘watches,’—leaving

‘*The clothes*’ along with which the man is to bathe should be the two
pieces that one wears ordinarily as a matter of necessity.

‘*Enter water*.’—This implies that the bathing is not to be done with
water drawn from the well or tank.

‘*With women*’—even of the Brāhmaṇa caste—‘*he shall not

‘*Those whose sins ham become known*’—to the people.

‘*These penances*’—the several kinds of *Kṛcchra*. Those who have
committed secret sins are not to perform the *Kṛcchra* penances; they
should he purified^(‘)*by means of sacred texts and Homa-offerings*.’

“Who is to do this purification? If the Assembly, then in the case of
secret sins the offender does not go to the Assembly; for if he did go,
he would no longer be one^(‘)whose sin is not known’; and further, only
persons knowing the facts of the case are entitled to sit in the
Assembly.”

The answer to this is as follows:—The teacher does not mean to specify
who is to do the purification; his sole purpose is to teach the pupils
that such and such acts should be regarded as expiatory of secret
sins.—(226)

After the Brāhmaṇas have been apprized of it, the offender shall make
his guilt known to others also; this would be ‘*confession*.’

‘*Repentance*’— dejection of mind, finding expression in some such
feeling as—‘Woe to me that I committed such a misdeed! Useless has been
my sinner’s life’! and so forth.

‘*Study*’ here stands for the repealing of the *Sāvitrī*, or the
reciting of the Veda, in cases other than those of injury to living
creatures.

When a man is unable to perforin the austerity, there shall
be^(‘)*gifts*.’ This is what is meant by the assertion—‘*as also by
gifts in cases of difficulty*’; which means that when the austerity
causes great pain, the man may have recourse to gifts.’—(227)

In the expression ‘*naro-dharmam*,’ an ‘a’ is to be understood between
the two words. As the proclaiming of one’s own righteous deeds has been
forbidden—‘one should not proclaim his own good qualities’; while it is
‘*adharma*,’ ‘*sin*,’ that forms the subject-matter of the context; and

Some people take the ‘repentance’ to extend up to the term
‘renunciation.’ But this is not light; as ‘*repentance*’ consists in
*mental depression*, while ‘*renunciation*’ is in the form of the
resolution ‘such an act shall not be done again’; and that the two are
distinct acts is shown by the past-participial affix ‘*ktvā*’ in
‘*santapya*’—‘after one has repented, then comes the *renunciation*.’

Thus then the sense is—‘Like the expiation, the sinner should also do
(a) the confession, (b) the repentance and the renunciation.

‘*Becomes purified*’—obtains success.—(230)

‘*Thus*’—refers to the whole. lot of injunctions and prohibitions.

‘*Results arising after death from his deeds*’—‘The result of good acts
is Heaven, and that of bad ones, hell, if expiations are not performed,
and expiations are extremely painful,’—having thought over all this,
‘*he shall perform, good deeds*.’

‘*Good*’ is that which is enjoined, as also the *determination*, or
desire, to do it Thus it is that, even though in the case of the
prohibition ‘one shall not injure living creatures,’ what is expressed
by the words is causing pain to others by the raising and letting fall
of a stick or some other weapon, yet, on the strength of teachings like
the present verse, it is taken as forbidding the *wish* to injure.

Similarly in the case of the eating of what should not be eaten. Though
‘eating’ is the name given to the act ending with the swallowing of
food, yet even the mental act of desiring to eat has been forbidden.

Similarly also in the case of having intercourse with women with whom
one should not have intercourse; though ‘intercourse’ really stands for
the actual penetration of the organ, yet the act of mere willing to do
the act has been forbidden by other texts.

“If such be the ease with the acts of *killing*, *eating* and
*intercourse*, then the expiation for the *desire* to do these should be
the same as that for the actual acts themselves.”

There is no force in this objection. So far as the killing of a Brāhmaṇa
is concerned, what has been urged is certainly true; because of the
assertion—‘even though the man have not actually killed him, etc., etc.’
In other wises, the right course to adopt would always be to accept the
direct meaning of the-words of the texts concerned. As regards
prohibitions, on the strength of the said texts, they are taken us
pertaining to the whole series of acts, beginning with the *desire* to
act and ending with the actual act itself.

“If this be so, then, inasmuch as the liability to expiations has been
made conditional upon the doing of ‘a *forbidden* act’ (11. 44), the
expiation in each case would have to be in accordance with the
prohibition (even on the mete desire to act).”

Who says that there is no expiation? All that the words imply is that in
the case of the mere *will* to act, the expiation would be lighter than
that in that of the actual act. This would be the right course to adopt
in the course of all expiations.

“Whence is this particular rule obtained?”

From the very nature of prohibitions. In fact ‘the expiations also,
consisting in vows, restraints and pious acts, have their source in
determination.’ This last passage also refers to only Injunctions and
Prohibitions. ‘Vows’ are of the nature of Injunctions and ‘Restraints’
of the nature of Prohibitions. And having their purposes have been
fulfilled in these, the words need not be applied to other conditions
and circumstances (?). In the case of all prohibitions however, the
condition is present that the act is forbidden; whence it follows’ that
an expiation is necessary. But the expiation (in the case of mere
determination or desire) need not be the same as that in the case of the
actual act.

All this we shall show under the verse ‘coveting the property of others,
etc., etc,’ (12.5)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

If after having performed the expiation for a certain misdeed, one
commits the same act again, he becomes liable to a heavier expiation. It
is in view of this that it is said that ‘*he must not do it a second
time*.’

Or the words ‘*he must not do it a second time*’ may be taken as a
declamatory assertion commendatory of the ‘renunciation of misdeeds’
enjoined before (in 130);—the sense being that ‘he shall not abandon his
vow.’

Hence if one seeks absolution from the sin involved in the first
transgression, he should not repeat the act. Thus what is meant is that
merely by performing the expiation, one does not become freed from a
sin, if he commits the same act again.

But it does not stand to reason that, the man is not. absolved from sin,
both when he performs the expiation and when he does not perform it.
Hence the assertion in the present, verse must be taken simply as
indicating that there is heavy expiation in the case of committing the
deed over again.—(232)

What, the text means is that so long as the mind is not satisfied, one
may go on doing even more penances than what has been actually
prescribed.

When a misdeed has been committed, if there is in the mind a certain
‘*uneasiness*’—an uncomfortable feeling,—then, even though the
prescribed expiation may have been performed, it should be repeated,
till peace of mind has been secured.

The term ‘*penance*’ here stands for *gifts* and other prescribed, acts
also.—(233)

In the world of men whatever ‘*happiness*’—in the form of glory of
lordship over men and countries and so forth—or *physical*, in the form
of good health and the like,—or *social*, such as that obtained from
wealth, children and so forth—or the *sensual*, in the form of pleasures
derived from the wife and others;—and also that of the gods,—what has
been described in the Veda, in such passages as ‘hundred pleasures of
men constitute one pleasure of the gods’;—of all this austerity is the
‘*source*,’—the cause of its origin.

Austerity is its ‘*middle*’— The continued existence of a thing is
called its ‘*middle*.’

Similarly Austerity is its ‘*end*..’

The view of persons learned in the Veda is that Austerity brings about
the same desirable results, in the form of Heaven and other desirable
things, as those brought about by the sacrificial and other acts.—(234)

The foregoing should not give rise to the following idea—“Inasmuch as
such great things are said of Austerity, by its means I can get all I
want, even without doing the acts enjoined for me; specially as, on
account of my not possessing the requisite materials, I am not in a
position to perform all that is enjoined.”

It would not be right to entertain this idea, because—‘*the Austerity
for the Brāhmaṇa is Knowledge*.’ ‘*Knowledge*’ here stands for the
understanding of what is contained in the Veda; so long as the man does
not acquire this, nothing can accomplish anything for him. Hence it is
*Knowledge* that is called ‘Austerity.’

What the verse means is that even in times of distress one should not
neglect his duties.

‘*Knowledge*’ here stands for all the duties of the Brāhmaṇa, beginning
with the study of the Veda.

Similarly ‘*protecting*’ is the ‘*austerity*’ for the Kṣatriya.

‘*For* *the Śūdra*, *service*’—of twice-born men; it is the serving of
these that has been prescribed for him; of which the present verse is
only a reiteration.—(235)

‘*Hard to traverse*’— that which can be traversed with difficulty;
*e.g*., some great trouble due to illness, or to attack by a powerful
enemy. All this is easily met by ascetics.

‘*Hard to attain*’— that which is got with difficulty; *e.g*., the power
to fly in the sky and so forth.

‘*Hard to reach*’—*e.g*., riding on the back of clouds and so forth.

‘*Hard to do*’—*e.g*., the granting of boons and pronouncing of curses;
the reversing of these; as for instance Saṃvarta created another set of
divine beings.

All this is accomplished by Austerity.

These three verses describe the fact that the *Kṛcchra* penances are
conducive to all kinds of prosperity and advancement

“Inasmuch as the injunction of expiations forms the subject-matter of
the present context, any praises bestowed upon *Kṛcchra* must be taken
as supplementary to that injunction; and it would not be right to take
them as actually enjoining the penance itself as leading to prosperity.
Nor is it impossible to take the present verse as a purely commendatory
declamation,—the sense being—‘the Kṛcchra penances are so very effective
that what is hard to traverse, such as the ocean and the like, become
traversed by their means, wherefore then could they not wipe off sins?”

Our answer to this is as follows:—In the *Gṛhyasūtras* and the
*Sāmavidhāna*, we find the *Kṛcchra* enjoined without reference to
expiation; so that: since such injunctions of the penance are not in the
wake of any other enjoined act, the penance can certainly be taken as
leading to prosperity and advancement. It has also been declared
that—‘Having performed these *Kṛcchra* penances, one becomes
accomplished in all Vedas, and becomes recognised by all the gods.’
(*Gautama*, 20. 24). What is meant by ‘becoming accomplished in the
Vedas’ is that the performer obtains that reward which is obtainable by
the proper study, according to prescribed rules, of the Veda. This
injunction that we have of the study of Veda, without reference to
rewards, becomes fulfilled by the study of even a single Veda; so that
when several Vedas are studied, this can only be regarded as bringing
about special *merit*. The expression ‘becomes recognised by all the
gods’ means that he obtains the results obtainable from the performance
of all the sacrifices; if is only when a man performs sacrifices that he
becomes ‘recognised by the gods,’ and not by performing *expiations*,
which partake of the nature of *gifts* (not sacrifices). Further, what
has been said in the present work in connection with the statement that
‘for the Brāhmaṇa, Austerity is knowledge’ (236),—which was suspected of
implying the omission by the Brāhmaṇa of all his duties,—is possible
only if the penance in question be regarded as conducive to prosperity
and advancement. As for expiations, they are meant to remove sins; they
are not of the nature of acts performed for the attainment of desirable
results; so that the scope of the two sets of acts being different, how
could anything said in regard to expiations be suspected of leading to
the omission of duties? If, on the other hand, the Kṛcchra penances were
conducive to prosperity and advancement, they would stand on the same
footing as other acts tending to the same end; and it would be natural
to suspect the omission of these latter. Thus we conclude that while the
next verse speaks of these penances as destructive of sins, the present
one speaks of them as conducive to prosperity and advancement; and these
two sentences stand apart from each other; and it is only light that
what is asserted by means of the ‘sentences’ should set aside what is
only indicated by the context, it is in this sense that we have the
following declaration of Dvaipāyana and other sages—‘By the force of
Austerities, powerful intellect and other excellences are acquired.’

From all this it follows that Austerities are conducive to all kinds of
desirable results. In the case of the Vedic rituals, though it has been
declared that ‘the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* sacrifices are conducive to *all
results*, the *Jyotiṣṭoma* is conducive *to all results*,’ yet, from the
very nature of persons undertaking the performance of these rites, the
term ‘all’ in this declaration is taken as standing only *for all those
results that have been declared as following from these sacrifices*, and
not actually *all* results in the literal sense of the term. But in the
case in question it is not so; what is said in the present verse has to
be taken as literally true.—(238)

that, these insects and other beings experience by the very nature of
their existence is the ‘austerity’ in their case; and when they have
thereby destroyed their sins (on account of which they were born as
insects, etc.) they go forward to heaven to which they are entitled by

Before undertaking a rite conducive to a desirable result, it is
necessary to perform an austerity; it is this fact that is referred to
here. To this end it. has been declared that—‘First of all one should
perform austerities, and thereby become pure and sanctified; he then
becomes fit for performing religious acts.’ In the case of rites, where
preliminary Initiation and such other rites are prescribed, these would
constitute the necessary ‘austerity’; also the penance that is
prescribed in connection with certain rites, is an ‘austerity,’ and in
such rites as are performed for the allaying of troubles, and obtaining
of strength, and also the domestic rites,—it is necessary to perform an
austerity, as a preliminary step. This is what the verse means.

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ stands here for all those persons that are
entitled to the performance of sacrifices, and are prompted by desire
for their results.

It has also been declared elsewhere—‘Unless a man has performed
austerities, the gods do not accept his offerings, and until his
offerings are accepted, his desires are not fulfilled.’

Though as a matter of fact, it is not the gods that bestow the results
of sacrifices, yet, inasmuch as no ‘sacrifice’ can be accomplished
without its ‘deity,’ it has been declared that *the gods* ‘*advance the
man’s interests*.’

When the gods are described as ‘accepting the offerings,’ it is not
meant that they actually take hold of the materials offered; all that is
meant is that they do not refuse to be the recipients of the
offerings.—(242)

to those who may be led to think that the injunction of Austerities in
the present context means that Brāhmaṇas may omit all other duties; just
the same contingency that was suspected in connection with the previous
statement that ‘for the Brāhmaṇa, knowledge is austerity’ (Verse 235).

‘Tolerance’ has been mentioned as standing for all the qualities of the
soul.

‘*Even those due to heinous offences*.’—This term ‘*even*’ appears to be
commendatory; it does not mean that the heinous offences are actually
set aside; and from all that has been said before it follows that what
is meant is that these grievous sins cease to be immediately
operative.—(245)

This is the praise of knowledge; and what we learn from this section of
the text is that for the learned man purification is secured by a
comparatively light expiation.

‘*Knowledge*’—here means what is contained in the Veda, along with the
esoteric explanations. Mere *knowledge* of the rules of Expiation cannot
bring about purification. If it did, there would be no possibility of
any one actually performing the rite. As for the knowledge of the real
nature of gods and other things, and the knowledge of purely esoteric
matters,—since this also is not acquired for any selfish purpose, it is
only right that it should be destructive of sins. To this sense it has
been declared—‘Just as water does not touch the lotus-leaf, so does sin
not contaminate the man who knows this.’—(*Chāndogya Upaniṣad*, 4.14.3).

‘*Fuel*’—wooden sticks.

Just as dry wood thrown into fire is quickly consumed, so does knowledge
destroy all sins;—the only ground of similarity lying in there being
*destruction* in both cases.

‘*Learned in the Veda*.’—This serves to qualify the *knowledge*
specially meant; so that the knowledge of Logic, Arts, Poetry and such
subjects becomes excluded.—(246)

‘*Breath*’—is air moving along the mouth and the nostrils,—its
‘*suppression*’ means its *suspension* and it is known as standing for
the control of the air moving outwards, as also that proceeding inward.

‘*Vyāhṛtis*’—the seven syllables (‘*bhūḥ*’ and the rest).

‘*Praṇava*’—the syllable ‘*Om*.’

What the verse means is that ‘one shall perform the breath-suppressions
with the *Vyāhṛtis* and the *Praṇava*.’

‘*Sixteen*’—is the number of repetitions of the act.

“What sort of association is there (between the breath-suspension and
the syllables)?”

Some people say that what is meant is that ‘after each suppression of
breath, the Vyāhṛtis and the Praṇava should be repeated.’

Others declare that the syllable should be meditated upon during the
time that the breath is suppressed.

“What is the time for each breath-suppression?”

It shall be continued so long as the suppression of breath does not
begin to be painful.

‘*Breath-suppression*’ stands for what has been described under the
names ‘*Kumbhaka*,’ ‘*Pūraka*’ and ‘*Rechaka*’—and not mere *suspension
of breathing*. And for these there can be no restriction as to time.

‘*Even the murderer of the embryo*.’—The term ‘*even*’ is meant to
include others also whose sins resemble that of ‘murdering the
embryo.’—(248)

etc*.,’ found in the *Ṛgveda* (1.97.1).

‘*The Vāsiṣṭha hymn consisting of the triad of verses beginning with*
“*Prati*.”’—The group of three verses, ‘*prati*’ being the opening word
of the hymn.—‘*Pratistomebhirupasaṃvasiṣṭhāḥ, etc*.’ (Ṛgveda, 7.80.1).

‘*Māhitra hymn*’—that revealed to the *Mahitṛs*,—this also consists of
three verses, and contains the term ‘*Mahitṛ*’ (Ṛgveda, 10.185.1).

Some people read ‘*Mahendram*’ (for ‘*Māhitram*’); and this would mean
the forty-eight verses ‘*Mahān Indra ojase*, etc. etc.’ (Ṛgveda,

‘*Itīti*’—the first ‘*iti*’ is the opening word of the text referred to,
and the second ‘*iti*’ is meant to show that the former is the opening
word of a text;—and it serves to show that a different text is meant.
Thus it is that we get at the indication of a particular sacred text.

‘*Pauruṣa-Sūkta*’—is the hymn consisting of sixteen verses, beginning
with the word ‘*sahasraśīrṣā*.’—(251)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.305), which says that this refers
to cases of *unintentional* offences;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 458).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Yājñavalkya* (3.304).—‘By reciting the *Sahasraśīrṣā* hymn, the
violator of the *Guru’s* bed becomes freed from sin; and afterwards a
milch cow should be given away.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (26.7).—‘The violator of the *Guru’s* bed is freed from sin
if he repeatedly recites the hymn beginning with “*Haviṣpāntam ajaram*,”
that beginning with “*Na tam* *aṃhaḥ*,” and the *Puruṣa-hymn*.’

*Viṣṇu* (55.6).—‘The violator of the *Guru’s* bed becomes free from sin
by fasting for three days and reciting the *Puruṣa-hymn* and, at the
same time, offering *Homa*.’

After the treatment of the ‘Heinous Offences,’ other ‘*sins, great and
small*,’—*i.e*., the ‘minor offences,’—are next dealt with.

He who ‘*desires to expiate*’ these should ‘*repeat for one year the
verse beginning with* “ava.”’—The term ‘*ava*’ indicates the opening
word of the verse ‘*Ava te hedo varuṇa namobhiḥ, etc*.’ (Ṛgveda,
1.24.14),—this verse containing words indicating *absolution from sins*;
it does not stand for the other verse beginning with
‘*ava*’—‘*avatadenīmāheturāṇam*.’ Or, he shall recite the verse
‘*Yatkiñcedam varuṇa daivyejanaḥ, etc*.’ (Ṛgveda, 7.89.5).—(252)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The two verses mentioned are Ṛgveda 1.24.14 and 7.89.5.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 993), which adds that as
the number of repetitions is not mentioned, the texts have to be recited
at all times, except when the man’s time may be taken up by other
necessary acts;—it remarks that what is stated here refers to cases of
repeated offence.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.306), which makes the same remarks as
*Madanapārijāta*.

‘*What should not be accepted*’—such as wine and similar things, or gold
and such things from a sinner,—this latter also being ‘*what should not

‘*Reprehensible food*’—food that has been polluted by any one of the
four causes—its very nature, lapse of time, ownership and contact.

‘*Taratsamandīya verses*’—are four of the ‘*Pāvamanī*’ verses (Ṛgveda,
9.58.1-4).—(258)

‘*Samām*’—for one year.

‘*Sacred texts related to the Śākala-homa*’ are the eight verses
beginning with—‘*Devakṛtasyainasovayajanamaṣi*’ (Vājasaneya Saṃhitā,
8.13);—if one makes Homa-offerings of clarified butter with these texts,
for one year, he destroys even the ‘*most grievous sin*,’—*i.e*., even
all the ‘heinous offences.’

‘By repeating’ the mantra ‘*namo rudrāya tavase kapardine, etc*.’
(Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, 16)—for one year,—he obtains the same success;—even
without performing the *Śākala-homa*.

Thus this ‘repeating of the mantra’ is an expiation alternative to the
aforesaid ‘Śākala-homa’; as also to the reciting of some other text

*Gautama* (24.12).—‘Thrice repeating the *Aghamarṣaṇa* hymn, while
immersed in water one is freed from all sins.’

*Baudhāyana* (3.5.1-6).—‘Now we shall describe the rule of the most holy
*Aghamarṣaṇa*:—One goes to a bathing place and bathes there; dressed in
a pure dress, he shall raise, close to the water, an altar, and
moistening his clothes by one application of water, and filling his hand
once with water, he shall recite the *Aghamarṣaṇa* hymn privately. He
shall repeat it one hundred times in the morning, one hundred times at
midday, and one hundred times, or an unlimited number of times in the
afternoon. When the stars have appeared, he shall partake of gruel
prepared of one handful of barley. After seven days and nights of this
course, he is freed from all minor sins, committed intentionally or
unintentionally; after twelve days and nights, from all other sins,
except the *Mahāpātakas*; after twenty-one days he overcomes even these
latter and conquers them.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (26.8).—‘Plunging into water, he may thrice recite the
*Aghamarṣaṇa*. Manu has declared that the effect of this is the same as
that of joining in the final bath of the *Āśvamedha*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.302).—‘The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, having fasted for
three days and having recited, in water, the *Agha* *marṣaṇa* hymn, and
giving a milch cow, becomes purified.’

the word ‘Om.’

The ‘*primeval Brahman*,’ which is ‘*esoteric*’—as being set forth in
detail in the esoteric sections of the Veda, where it is put forward as
an object of worship. Or it may be regarded as ‘*esoteric*’ on account
of its being denotative of the supreme soul, and not in the sense of
*being unknown*; since it is well-known among people as the syllable
‘*Om*.’

That wherein the Vedic Triad lies condensed,—since all letters are
described as contained in ‘Om.’ The worship or meditation of this has
been already described above, as also in such passages as—‘One should
meditate upon the syllable *Om*’ (Chāndogya Upa, 1.1.1).

The preceding verse has spoken of the Mantras as the ‘Veda,’ while in
the present verse it is the *Vedānta* that is so spoken of. As for
knowledge of *duties*, this is provided by what has been enjoined under
‘Vedic Study.’—(265)
