<details><summary><h4>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः ...{Loading}...</h4></summary>

In the present context the term ‘Law’ stands for *the whole collection
of Injunctions and Prohibitions contained in the Smṛtis*, and not for
any particular *treatise*; as this latter was composed by Manu; that is
why the Treatise is called ‘Mānava’ (of Manu); otherwise \[ *i.e*., if
the Treatise were the ‘Law’ propounded by the Imperishable One\], it
would have been ‘*Hairaṇyagarbha*,’ ‘of Hiraṇyagarbha.’

Others however have held that the Treatise itself was composed by
Hiraṇyagarbha \[and is spoken of in the text as the ‘Law’ propounded by
him\], and since it came to be revealed to, and published among, many
persons by *Manu*, it is only right that it should he called after the
name of the latter. For instance, the Ganga has its real source
somewhere else (in Heaven), and yet since it is seen for the first time
in the Himavat (Himālaya), it is called ‘*Haimavatī*’ (proceeding from
Himavat), after the name of the latter;—similarly though the Vedic text
is eternal, yet since it was expounded by Kaṭha, it is called
‘*Kāṭhaka*,’ after his name; even though there are several other
expounders and learners of that Veda, yet it is called after Kaṭha, on
account of the superiority of his expounding. Nārada also has declared
thus:—‘This Treatise, consisting of 100,000 verses, was composed by
Prajāpati, and, in due course, it came to be abridged by Manu and
others.’ Thus, even though the Treatise may have been originally
composed by some one else, there is nothing incongruous in its being
called ‘Mānava,’ ‘of Manu.’ As for the term ‘*Śāstra*,’ ‘*Law*’ (of the
text) standing for the *Treatise*, we often find it so used, in the
sense that the subject expounded by it is *instruction*, ‘*śāṣana*.’

‘*He taught it to me*,’ I was taught by him.—‘*Himself*,’ ‘*first of
all*,’ ‘*with care*,’—these words indicate the fact that there was no
break in the continuity of tradition in regard to the Law. As a matter
of fact, when the author of a book ‘*himself*’ teaches it first of all,
not a single syllable of it is lost; while when the book composed by one
person is taught by another person who has learnt it from the former,
there is not the same ‘*care*’ taken in guarding the text from loss. In
fact, in the case of the author himself, when he has taught it once and
established its position, he feels confident that he has already taught
it once, and hence when he comes to teach the work a second time, he is
likely to be careless and lazy; so that lapses in the text become
possible; hence the text has added the phrase ‘*first of all*’.—‘*With
due care*,’—the term ‘*vidhi*,’ ‘*care*,’ stands here for the quality,
in the teacher and the pupil, of having undiverted attention, a
concentrated mind; and the affix ‘*vati*’ (in the term ‘*vidhivat*’)
signifies *capability, possession*.

‘*Then I taught it to Marīci and other sages*.’—In as much as Marīci and
the other sages are persons of well-known reputation, when Manu speaks
of such well-known persons having learnt the Law from him, he describes
his connection with specially qualified pupils, and thereby indicates
his well-established professional dignity; and by pointing out the
importance of the Law, he produces in the minds of the great sages (who
have asked him in verse 1 *et seq*. to propound the Law) faith and
confidence, so that they may be unremitting in their study; the idea
being—‘So important is this Law that oven such great sages as Marīci and
the rest have learnt it,—Manu also is such a high personage that he is
the Teacher of those great sages,—so that it is highly proper that this
Treatise should be learnt from him with this idea in their minds, the
enquirers who have come to hear the Law propounded would not cease to
give their attention to it.—Both these facts are mentioned with a view
to eulogise the Law.—(58)

‘*Vidhivat*’—‘With due attention’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja);—‘according to rule,—with due ceremonies’ (Kullūka).

In connection with the authorship of the Smṛti see *Bhāṣya* (Printed
edition, Gharpure, p. 7) and also Buhler’s Introduction p. xv. Burnell
in his footnote on Verse 58, misrepresents Medhātithi, by imputing to
him a view which he has put forward only as held by ‘some people’
‘*Kechit*’.

Parāśara-mādhava (Ācāra—p. 106) quotes this verse in support of the view
that the Smṛtis are the work of Brahmā; and it adds that—‘as Brahmā, so
Svāyambhuva Manu also, compiles the Duties that have been ordained in
the Veda;—which establishes the beginningless and immutable character of
*Dharma*.’

‘*This*,’ Law;—‘*to you*’;—‘*Bhṛgu will describe fully*,’ will carry it
to your cars, will teach and will explain: The pronoun ‘*this*’ (in the
second line) refers to the *Law*; the whole of this Law this Sage has
‘*learnt*,’ read, ‘*in its entirety*,’ ‘*from me*’ at my hands. The
teaching proceeds as it were, from the Teacher’s mouth, and the pupil
takes hold of it, as it were; it is for this reason that we have the
affix ‘*tasi*,’ in the word ‘*mattaḥ*,’ in the sense of the Ablative.

*Bhṛgu* is a person whose greatness is very well known to the sages; so
that by directing him to explain the Law, Manu shows that the Law has
come down through a tradition of teaching handed down by a long line of
several persons possessing exceptional knowledge of all sciences. It is
for this reason that some people are to undertake the study of the Law
by the following considerations:—‘This Law has come down from several
high-souled persons,—why then should we not study it.’ This
consideration serves to prompt men to study and thus attracts them to
the Law.—(59)

This Verse is quoted by the Aparārka (p. 4) with a view to show that the
writer of a work often quotes himself,—and wherever *manurabravīt*
occurs, it is Manu’s own words that are quoted, not those of Bhṛgu, the
compiler.

That great sage ‘*Bhṛgu*,’ ‘*bring thus directed*’—prompted, by means of
the words ‘Bhṛgu will describe it to you’;—‘*thereupon*,’—after
that,—‘*said to the sages*’—‘*Listen*.’

‘*With a gladdened heart*’;—his gladness being due to the idea of
respectability implied by the fact that from among the several pupils
(of Manu) he had been directed to teach; Bhṛgu’s idea of his own
respectability was based upon this idea—‘I, who am an obedient pupil of
Manu, have been thus honoured by him, by reason of my special aptitude
to expound the Law.’—(60)
