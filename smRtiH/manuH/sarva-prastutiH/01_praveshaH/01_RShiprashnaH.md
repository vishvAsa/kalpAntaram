Salutation to the Supreme Brahman! His real character can be known only
from the Vedānta texts; He is the cause of the three worlds; and He
destroys all evil.

The first four verses describe the fact of the treatise being the work
of a highly qualified author, and of its providing instructions bearing
upon such ends of man as are not knowable by means of any other source
of knowledge; and this is done for the purpose of indicating its
importance (and raising it in the estimation of men). When a treatise
has secured high position in the estimation of men, its author obtains
fame, and also heaven; and both these continue to exist as long as the
world exists. A scientific treatise, has its position established only
when people engage in studying, in listening to lectures on, and in
pondering over, it. Intelligent persons cannot undertake the said study,
etc., until they have satisfied themselves as to the purposes served by
them. It is for this reason that, the Teacher has composed the four
verses with a view to point out that the Treatise is put forth for the
purpose of making known the means of accomplishing the ends of man.

It would not be right here to argue as follows:—“Even without the
purpose of the Treatise being stated at the very outset, we could easily
ascertain what that purpose is, by examining the several parts of the
Treatise going to be propounded; what then is the use of making an
effort to describe that purpose? Further, even if the purpose is stated
at the very outset, one cannot bo sure of it until be has fully examined
the subsequent portions of the Treatise; as a matter of fact, all the
assertions that a man may make do not always bring conviction. Nor is it
necessary that every undertaking must be preceded by the knowledge of
purposes served by it; for instance, we find pupils undertaking the
study of the Veda, without knowing beforehand the purposes to be served
by that study. In the works of human authors also, the practice of
stating the purpose is not always followed. For instance, the revered
Pāṇini begins hi s Sutras with the words ‘Now follows the teaching of
words,’ without having stated the. purpose to be served by his
treatise.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—Unless people have ascertained
the purpose served by a particular Treatise, they would not, in the
first place, take it up at all; and unless they take it up, how could
they examine the whole of it? Then again, that same idea which is got at
by the examination of the entire Treatise, becomes more easily
comprehended if it has been briefly indicated in the beginning. It is
with reference to this that there is the assertion that—‘in ordinary
experience, the learned always consider it desirable to carry ideas in
their minds briefly as well as in greater detail.’

As regards the argument that—“even when the purpose has been stated
there can be no certainty about it, for the simple reason that we do not
derive conviction from the words of human beings,—in whose oase the idea
that we have is that this man knows the matter as he says, and not that
the fact is really as he asserts,”—our answer is that we do not quarrel
over the question as to whether the words of human

beings do, or do not, bring about conviction; because discussion over
this question would swell the size of our work. But as a matter of fact,
even though it is possible for a man to have recourse to a certain
course of action, even when he is in doubt as to the exact purpose
served by it,—yet until there is some statement as to the purpose served
by a particular action, even doubts could not arise in regard to it. In
fact, if some statement had not been made in regard to the purpose to be
served by the present Treatise, the doubt that would arise in men’s
minds would be (not as to whether or not it was going to serve any
useful purpose, but) as to whether it is a treatise on Law or on
Economics, or an aimless attempt in the nature of an examination of such
subjects as the ‘Crow’s teeth’ and the like. On the other hand, when the
aim of the work has been stated, the idea arising in our minds is—‘the
author of this work asserts that he is going to show us the path leading
to our welfare,—there is no harm done by our undertaking the study of
the work,—well, let us look into it’; and forthwith we take up the work.

Next as regards the case (cited by the opponent) of pupils taking up
Vedic study (without being told of the exact purpose to be accomplished
thereby),—the fact of the matter is that the action of the pupil is due
to his being urged to it by his Teacher, and not to his recognition of
the fact that if behoves him to take up the study (for the
accomplishment of any purpose of his own); in fact being quite a child
at the time (of beginning Vedic study), it is not possible for him to
have any idea as to his being entitled to the study (by virtue of his
having an aim that could be served only by that study); and his
activity, therefore, is brought about entirely by the direction of
another person (his Teacher); who does not bewilder him by pointing out
to him that he is entitled to take up the study; and when once the boy
has taken up Vedic study (entirely under advice of his Teacher), the
motive for further study is provided by the desire to know the meaning
of the Vedic texts studied; and thus the study continues to be carried
on. \[This is the case with the study of the Veda.\] As regards the
study of the present Treatise (on Law), only such persons are entitled
to it as have already studied the Veda, as is clearly indicated by the
text—‘the twice-born person who, without having studied the Vedas,
devotes his energies to other subjects \[becomes a Shudra\]’ (Manu,
2.168); and by that time the pupil has his intelligence aroused, and
consequently seeks to know wbat purpose is to be served by any further
action that he is going to undertake.

As regards the revered Pāṇini, his aphorisms are extremely brief; so
that there is no possibility of their having any other meaning (or
serving any other purpose) than the one directly expressed by them; and
further, the fame of Pāṇini is well known to even the smallest boy; so
that the purpose served by his work is too well known to need
reiteration. The present treatise (of Manu) on the other hand is on an
extensive scale, abounding in several (commendatory and condemnatory)
‘Descriptions,’ and it helps in the accomplishment of all human ends; so
that if its aim is stated in easily intelligible words, there is no harm
done.

Of enquirers (and students) there are two classes,—one following
reasoning, and another following tradition. The former of these take up
the study of Manu; because they know the importance and greatness of the
author and his work from such texts as—‘whatever Manu said is wholesome’
(*Kāṭhaka*, 11.5), and ‘Manu has said all that has been said in the
Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda, the Sāmaveda and the Mantras of the Atharva, as
also by the Seven Great Sages.’ And those of the latter class undertake
it merely under the influence of the tradition, the source of which they
have carefully investigated—that the treatise has been composed by
Prajāpati himself. And for the sake of such persons, the mentioning of
the name of the Author also is a factor leading to action (towards s
tudy).

It is for these reasons that we have here the laying out of the aim of
the Treatise, in the form of question and answer: The Great Sages are
the questioners, Prajāpati is the expounder, and the subject is
*Dharma*, which being not amenable to the ordinary means of knowledge,
can be known only from the *Śāstras* (Scientific Treatises),—it is so
difficult that even the Great Sages have doubts in regard to it. That
Prajāpati is the actual expounder is indicated by the words of the text
itself, which says—being questioned by them,’ and not ‘I, being
questioned by them’; and of himself again Manu speaks (12.123) as being
the natural image (representative) of Brahmā. Thus an effort is
necessary for the expounding of the Law. Such is the sense of the first
four verses.

In what manner the present Treatise is made up of Instructions bearing
upon the ends of man we shall show by the interpretation of the words of
the text.

Now, in the text we have tho declarations—(l) ‘the Great Sages, having
approached Manu, said to him—‘do please expound to us the Duties of
Man,’ and (2) ‘being thus questioned by them, He said—‘*listen*’; and
these two—the question and its answer—in their import, are expressive of
the one idea that *the Treatise expounds the Dharmas*; (he word ‘Dharma’
is in common parlance used in the sense of that means of accomplishing
one’s good which is not cognisable by any of the ordinary means of
knowledge, with the sole exception of ‘word.’ Hence when it is said
‘listen to Dharma,’ what is meant is that what is going to be expounded
is conducive to the fulfilment of the higher ends of man.

‘*Manu*’ is the name of a particular person known, in long-continued
tradition, as having studied several Vedic texts, as knowing their
meaning and as practising the precepts therein contained;—‘*Eating
approached*’ him, *i.e*., having gone forward near him, intentionally,
giving up all other actions, and not by mere chance, having met with him
the special effort made by the Sages to get near Manu shows the
importance of the subject-matter of their question, as also the
authoritative and trustworthy character of the expounder; a man who is
not capable of rightly expounding a subject is never questioned by
persons going up to him for that purpose.—‘*Whose mind was calm and
collected*’—‘*Seated* *with mind calm and collected*,’—*i.e*., whose
mind was in a tranquil state; and it does not mean ṭhat he was actually
seated upon a mat, or some such seat; os there would be no point in
stating this; in fact the word ‘seated’ merely connotes *calmness*; it
is only when one’s mind is calm that he is capable of answering
questions.—‘*Having approached*’—has for its object simply ‘Manu’;
‘*seated with mind calm and collected*’ being an adverbial clause
modifying the act of ‘questioning’ (by the sages). The sense of the
sentence thus is—‘they said to him the following words, on finding, from
the manner in which he engaged into conversation with them in making
enquiries about their welfare, that his mind was not preoccupied, but
calm and collected, and he was therefore attentive to their
questioning.’

The term ‘*ekāgra*,’ by ordinary usage, connotes what is meant by (he
term is *steadiness of the mind*, it being concentrated upon the
contemplation of the knowledge of truth, following upon the cessation of
all doubts and illusions of the person in whom the contact of all
defects of passion and the like is set aside by inhibition. It is only
when one h as his mind in this condition that he is capable of
apprehending sound and other objects that lie within reach of his
senses; which is not the case when he is in doubt as to the object being
a real entity or otherwise.—Or, etymologically the term ‘*agra*’ denotes
the *mind*, by reason of the fact that in the act of apprehending things
it is the Mind that *goes before (agragāmi*) the Eye and other
sense-organs; and in ordinary parlance that which *acts first* or *goes
ahead*, is called ‘*agra*’;—so that the compound ‘*ekāgra*’ is to be
expounded as ‘he who has his *agra*, or Mind, fixed upon one perceptible
object’; there being nothing incongruous in a Bahuvrīhi Compound being
taken, if its sense demands it, as referring to things that are not
co-existent. By this explanation also ‘*ekāgra*’ connotes *absence of
distraction*.

‘*Saving paid their respects in due form*’—‘Due form’ stands for the
rule prescribed in the scriptures; and they did not transgress any such
rule; the scriptures have laid down the rule that on first approaching
his Teacher, the pupil should offer his obeisance, attend upon him, and
so forth; and it was in this prescribed manner that the sages *paid
their respects* to Manu; which means that they showed due devotion and
respect.

*The great sages*.— The word ‘*ṛṣi*’ means the *Veda*; and the word
‘*ṛṣi*’ is applied also to a person, by virtue of his possessing
excellent knowledge of the Veda and all that is prescribed therein and
acting up to these. The *Ṛṣis*, sages, who approached Manu, were
*great*; the said persons become ‘great,’ when the above-mentioned
qualities become developed in them to a very high degree; just as
Yudhiṣṭhira is called the ‘greatest of the Kurus’ (because he possessed,
jn a very high degree, the qualities that distinguished the members of
the Kuru-race).—Or the sages may be regarded as ‘great,’ by virtue of
their superior austerities, or of the great respect and fame enjoyed by
them.

‘*They addressed these words*’—‘*Vacana*’ is *that by which something is
spoken of*; this refers to the question formulated in the second verse;
these being the *nearest* ‘words’ are what are referred to by the
pronoun ‘these.’ Some people have held that the pronoun ‘this’ always
refers to something directly perceived at the time; for these people
also the question may bo regarded as ‘perceived,’ on account of its
being present in the mind.—Or ‘*vacana*,’ may mean *that which is spoken
of*; and in that case it would stand for the *subject-matter questioned
about*. If it be taken as referring to the *sentence* (and, not to the
subject-matter), then the meaning would be that ‘they pronounced this
sentence.’—If the term ‘*vacana*’ means *that which is spoken of*, the
sense is that ‘they asked the following question’; and in that case the
verb ‘*abruvan*,’ ‘addressed,’ would have two objects,—‘Manu’ being the
indirect object. In fact, Manu is the object of all the three verbs in
the sentence (*approach*, *pay respects to* and *address*).—(1).

‘*Pratipūjya*’—has been taken by Kullūka to mean also after mutual
salutations’; and be has taken ‘*yathānyāyam*’ with ‘*abravīt*.’
Sarvajñanārāyaṇa takes it to mean ‘*pratyekam pūjayitvā*’, having
honoured them severally’.

*Medhātithi* (p. 1, 1. 18) curiously ascribes the assertion ‘*atha
śabdānuśāsanam*’ to Pāṇini, not to Patañjali.

P. 2, 1. 4—appears to favour the *Prābhākara* view in regard to the
*Śastrārambha* (vide *Prabhākara-Mīmāṃsa*). But on p. 73, 1. 20, the
*Bhāṭṭa* view is also accepted.

P. 2, 1. 12.—‘Whatever Manu said &c.,’—This text occurs in several
Saṃhitas in varying forms, where it refers to the secred (sacred?) texts
‘seen’ by Manu. But there is nothing to prevent the deduction being
drawn that tins declaration proves the antiquity of the ‘Law of Manu’,
though it need not be exactly in the form in which it has been handed
down to us by Bhṛgu and his pupils.

P. 2, 1. 13.—‘Manu has said &c.’—“*ṛco yajūṃṣi*” &c.—The second half of
this verse is quoted by Bidder (XIV) as “*maharṣibhistu tatproktaṃ
smārtaṃ tu manurabravīt*”, and translated as ‘the Vedas were proclaimed
by the great sages, but the *Smārta*, or traditional lore, by Manu.’ It
is strange that Buhler did not notice that such a statement as this
would not add very much to Manu’s claims to exceptional honour. The
right reading of the verse is, as we find in the printed texts of
Medhātithi, *saptarṣibhistu yatproktaṃ tu(?) sarvammanurabravīt*,’ ‘the
Ṛk verses......... and all that has been declared by the seven
sages,—all this has Manu expounded’. This would mean that the work of
Manu contains all the teachings that had gone before him.

P. 3, 1. 11.—‘Having paid their respects’, &c.—*pratipūjyā
yathānyāyam*—The commentaries on this expression throw a curious light
on their own relative antiquity: Medhātithi explains it simply
as—*yādṛśī śāstreṇābhivādanopāsanādikā guroḥ prathamopasarpaṇe pūjā
vihitā tathā pūjayitvā*—and he does not seek to Emphasise and explain
the anomaly involved in the teacher being a ‘Kṣatriya’ and the
questioners ‘Brāhmaṇas’, and the latter offering *pūjā* to the former.
Kullūka has tried to tone down the anomaly by explaining *pratipūjya* as
*pūjitāḥ santaḥ pūjāṃ kṛtvā*—‘They offered the *pūjā* after they had
themselves received the *pūjā* due to themselves;’ and Rāghavānanda goes
a step farther and explains as *yathānyāyam* as “*nyāpo'tra kṣatriyeṣu
brāhmaṇādīnāṃ na namaskāraḥ kintu vākapūjā* \|”

P. 3, 1. 13.—‘*The word ṛṣi means the Veda*’—The word ‘*ṛṣi*’ is
explained by Medhātithi as a synonym for the *Veda*, and in his Bhāṣya
on verse 11 below he actually uses the word in that sense. According to
him the term *primarily* denotes the *Veda*, and only *secondarily the
person who possesses special knowledge of the Veda*.

The second verse describes what the sages said to Manu, after having
approached and worshipped him.

The term ‘*bhaga*,’ ‘blessings,’ is used for *superiority, magnanimity,
fame, strength* and so forth; and ‘*bhagavān*’ is he who possesses all
this; that is (in the present context) *Manu*; hence it is he who is
addressed by the term ‘O blessed one.’

The term ‘*caste*’ is applied to the three castes, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’
‘*Kṣatriya*,’ and ‘*Vaiśya*’—the term ‘all’ has been added for the
purpose of including the ‘*Śūdra*’; if this was not done, then, the
question, emanating from the Great Sages (who represent only the three
higher castes), would be restricted to the three castes only.

‘*Intermediate*’ means *middle*; from the mixture of two castes there
arises another imperfect caste; those that are born out of those
imperfect unions are the ‘intermediate castes,’ born in the natural
order or the reverse; those known under the names ‘*Mūrdhāvasikta*,’
‘*Kṣattṛ*,’ ‘*Vaidehika*’ and so forth (*Vide*, Manu 10.7 *et. seq*.),
these could not be classed under the caste either of the mother or that
of the father; just as the Mule born out of the union of the Horse and
the Ass is a distinct species, it is neither the ‘horse’ nor the
‘ass’;—on this ground these would not be included under the ‘castes’;
hence they have been mentioned separately.

*Objection*—“But the offspring of ṭhe union of castes mixed in the
natural order is regarded as belonging to the caste of the mother.”

It is not so, we reply. From what is said under 10.6 as to these castes
being ‘similar,’ it is clear that they are only ‘similar’ to the caste
of the mother, and not quite the same as this latter. The functions of
these intermediate castes also are such as can be learnt only from
scriptures; they cannot be ascertained entirely from their natural
inclinations (as in the case of lower animals); and in as much as these
functions cannot be ascertained by the help of any other source of
knowledge, they fall under the term ‘Dharma,’ ‘duties,’ and as such
deserve to be expounded in the scriptures. Of the intermediate castes
born of unions in the reverse order, such duties as ‘not harming others’
and so forth are going to be described (by Manu himself under 10.63).
When they are spoken of as being ‘without any duties,’ the ‘duties’
meant are such as Observances, Fasts and so forth.

‘*Yathāvat*,’ ‘*in due form*.’—The suffix ‘*vati*’ denotes *propriety*;
the meaning being—‘in the form in which performance would be proper.’
This ‘propriety’ also includes such details as—‘this is compulsory, that
is optional,’ ‘this is primary, that is secondary,’ as also rules
relating to substance, place, time, agent and so forth.

‘*Anupūrvaśaḥ*,’ ‘*in due order*.’—‘Order’ means *sequence*; the meaning
is—‘please explain also the order in which the several duties have to be
performed.’ The order meant is such as—after the performance of the
‘Birth-rite,’ come respectively ‘Tonsure,’ ‘Initiation’ and so forth.
The phrase ‘in due form’ implies completeness in regard to
subject-matter; ‘order’ does not form part of the subject-matter, hence
the qualification ‘in due order’ has been added separately.

The word ‘*dharma*,’ ‘*duty*,’ is found to be used in reference to—(1)
the injunction of what should be done, (2) the prohibition of what
should not be done,—both these bearing upon transcendental purposes,—and
also (3) action in accordance with the said Injunctions and
Prohibitions. Whether the denotation of the term applies equally to
both, or it applies primarily to one only, and to another only
secondarily,—this we do not discuss on the present occasion; and we have
already discussed this in detail in another work (the *Smṛtiviveka*),
and it has no direct bearing on the present context. In any case, when
it is declared that the *Aṣṭakās* should be performed,’ what is clearly
understood is the *propriety of performing* in relation to the
*Aṣṭakāt*; and when it is declared that ‘the meat of the animal killed
by a poisoned arrow should not be eaten,' what is dearly understood is
the *impropriety of performing* in relation to the eating of the said
meat. Whether the *action of the Aṣṭakā* is regarded as ‘*duty*,’ or the
*propriety of performing that act*,—it does not make any difference in
the ultimate result. And when the form of ‘duty’ has been duly
expounded, that is contrary constitutes ‘*Adharma*’ (sin) follows
naturally by implication. Thus what is meant is that ‘*Dharma*,’ ‘Duty,’
as also ‘*Adharma*,’ ‘sin,’ both form the subject-matter of the
scriptural treatise: the *performance* of the ‘Aṣṭakā’ is a *Duty*, as
also is the *avoidance* of Brāhmaṇa-murder’; the *non-performance* of
Aṣṭaka’ is a *sin*, as also is the *performance* of Brāhmaṇa-murder’;
such is the distinction (between ‘Duty’ and ‘Sin’ as described in the
scriptures).

‘*Arhasi*,’ ‘*may you*’—indicates *ability* in the shape of possessing
the requisite capacity; and as such expresses the fact of the teacher
being a lit and proper person for the expounding the duties; the sense
being—‘in as much as you are fully able to expound the Duties, hence you
are a fit and proper person for that work,—ns such you are entreated by
us to explain to us the said Duties’; it follows by implication that
when a man is a fit and proper person for doing a certain act, that act
should be done by him. The term of entreaty ‘do please explain to us’ is
supplied from without.—(2)

‘O blessed one,’ *bhagavan*—The title *bhagavān* means ‘one who
possesses *Bhaga*.’ What ‘*bhaga*’ stands for is thus described in the
Viṣṇupurāṇa quoted by Kullūka—‘*Bhaga* is the name for the following
six—(1) full sovereignty, (2) strength, (3) fame, (4) glory, (5)
knowledge and (6) freedom from passion.’

‘Intermediate castes,’ *antaraprabhavān*—This refers to the ‘mixed
castes’ described under Discourse 10.

P. 3, l. 24—For *manuḥ* J reads *manoḥ* which would be construed with
*sambodhanam*.

P. 3, l. 25—for *jñātiṣu* (l. 25) J and Mand. lightly read *jātiṣu*.

P. 4, l. 3—Those castes being similar &c. *sadṛśāneva tānāhu*:—This is
Manu, 10. 6, where Medhātithi says—*te sadṛśā eva jñeyāḥ,
natajjātīyāḥ......tatsadṛśagrahaṇāt mātṛta utkṛṣṭāḥ pitṛto
nikṛṣṭāḥ*—‘They should he regarded as *equal to*, not of the same caste
as, their fathers; what is meant is that they are superior to the
mother, but inferior to the father.’

P. 4, l. 14—‘In another work,’ *granthāntare*—Does this refer to the
author’s *Smṛtiviveka* from which he has quoted in his comments on 2. 6
below?

Medhātithi does not attach much importance to the account of creation
here provided. In more than one place he says that the whole of Adhyāya
I is ‘mere *Arthavāda*.’ In his comments on verse 5, for instance, he
says that the process described is in some places in accordance with the
account found in the Purāṇas, and in others, in accordance with the
tenets of the Sāṅkhya system of philosophy; and that no attention need
be paid to this, as it has no direct bearing upon *Dharma*. Again under
verse 9, he says that as this subject does not form the real
subject-matter of the treatise, no attention need he paid to what the
author says on it.

Thou alone, O Lord, art conversant with what ought to be done, which forms the true import of this entire Veda—which is eternal, inconceivable and not directly cognisable.—(3)


“As a matter of fact, Vidhi is something in the form of what should be done, expressed by the injunctive and such other verbal expressions; and this, in all cases, must be directly expressed by actual words; under the circumstances, what do you mean by saying that there are two kinds of injunction,—that the term ‘one should offer’ denotes something to be done, and the procedure of the offering is indicated by implication in the manner described above?”

At this stage the following question arises—“It has been said that the
term ‘Duty’ is used in the sense of only that activity which tends to
accomplish a transcendental purpose; and such activity may consist in
the *performing of the Aṣṭakā*, as also in *bowing to Caityas* and such
other acts (prescribed in the heterodox scriptures); and what sort of
Duties is going to be expounded in the present Treatise?”

In answer to this we have the third verse, which serves the purpose of
pointing out what Duties are going to be expounded and also of further
indicating the aptitude of Manu already mentioned.

‘*Thou alone*’—without any one to help you; without a second.

‘*Sarvasya vidhānasya kāryatattvārthavit*.’—The term ‘*Vidhāna*,’
meaning that by which acts are enjoined, stands for the *scripture*;—it
is called ‘*svayambhu*’ in the sense that it is eternal, not a product,
not the work of man; and its name is ‘*Veda*’;—‘*entire*’ *i.e*.,
including the text which is directly found in the Veda, as also that the
exact words of which are only inferred; for instance, (*a*) in the
text—‘*one should perform the Agnihotra, it pertains to thousand
men*,—by means of this verse one should worship the Āhavanīya’—we have
the Veda directly enjoining what is to be done; the term ‘by means of
this,’ ending as it docs with the instrumental case-termination, serving
to point out the employment of the mantra-text directly quoted;—(*b*)
while in the case of the injunction ‘the Aṣṭakās should be performed,’
which is found in the *Smṛti, we* infer, on the strength of this
*Smṛti*, the corresponding Veda text;—similarly, when we read the
Mantra-text, ‘I am chopping grass, the seat of the Gods,’ we at once
infer, on the basis of the indicative power of the words of that text,
the Vedic injunction that ‘the said text is to be employed in the
chopping of grass this Mantra is found in that section of the Veda which
deals with the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice*, and the *chopping of grass*
is laid down as to be done in course of that sacrifice; but there is no
such direct injunction as that ‘the chopping should be done with such
and such a Mantra and the above-mentioned Mantra-text is found to be
capable, by its very form, of indicating the *chopping of grass*; while
as regards its being connected in a general way, with the sacrifice,
this follows the fact of its occurring in the same ‘context’ as the
injunction of that sacrifice; and it is by virtue of its own indicative
force that it comes to be employed in the chopping of grass. The idea
arising in the mind of the student (on noticing the above facts) is as
follows:—‘From the context it follows that the Mantra-text in question
should be used in the performance of the *pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices;—how is
this to be done?—well, the natural answer is that it is to be used in
the manner in which it is capable of being used; the capacity of a
thing, even though not directly mentioned, always help., in determining
its use;—what then is the Mantra-text capable of doing?—it is capable of
indicating the *chopping of grass*;—hence from the context, and from the
capability of the Mantra itself, it follows that it should be employed
in the chopping of grass’;—as soon as this idea has been arrived at, the
corresponding words, ‘by this Mantra the chopping of grass should be
done,’ present themselves to the mind; because as a matter of fact,
every concrete conception is preceded by the corresponding verbal
expression. The said verbal expression, thus presenting itself to the
mind, is called the ‘*inferred* Vedic text.’ The Text thus inferred is
regarded as ‘Veda,’ by virtue of the fact that it owes its existence to
the force of two other Vedic texts—*viz*., the text laying down the
*Darśapūrṇamāsa* and the *Mantra-text* referred to above. Such is the
opinion of Kumārila.

Or, the term ‘*vidhāna*’ may be taken as equivalent to ‘*vidki*’,
meaning actual *operation*, the *accomplishment of purpose*; this is
called ‘*svayambhu*’ in the sense that it is *eternal, i.e*., handed
down by beginningless tradition,—or that *it is prescribed in the
eternal Veda*;—‘entire’—*i.e*., what is prescribed in the directly
available verbal texts, and what is only implied by the force of what is
directly expressed by the words of the texts. The Vedic injunction is of
two kinds:—(a) There is one kind of injunction which is directly
expressed by the words; *e.g*., ‘desirous of Brahmic glory, one should
offer the *Saurya-Caru*’; here what is expressed is that one who desires
Brahmic glory is the ñt and proper person to offer the *Saurya-Caru*;
and when one proceeds to secure Brahmic glory by means of the said
offering, he learns that the procedure of the offering is analogous to
the *Āgneya* offering (which is the archetype of all *Caru-offerings*).
In both these cases the idea got at, being derived from the words of the
texts, is regarded as ‘derived directly from words;’ though the former
is derived directly from the words and the latter from what is
‘expressed by the worlds,’ yet, this difference, due to the removal of
the latter by one step, does not deprive it of the character of ‘being
derived from words.’ For instance, when the water in the pool is struck
by the hand, and it in its turn strikes against some other place; and
yet this latter place is regarded as being struck by the hand, though
not directly; similarly when pieces of rubber are thrown down, they rise
and fall, and all the subsequent acts of rising and falling are the
indirect effects of 'the first downward impulse imparted to them.
Exactly analogous is the case of the injunctions in question: Every
ectypal sacrifice is related to a particular form of procedure (borrowed
from its archetype). Similarly when we meet with the injunction ‘one
should perform the *Viśvajit* sacrifice,’ we argue that no injunction is
possible except in reference to a fit and proper person capable of (and
having a motive for) performing it, and hence come to the conclusion
that the person so capable is one who desires Heaven; this idea being
thus implied by the force of what is directly expressed by the words of
the text. It is in view of this two-fold character of injunctions (and
enjoined acts) that we have the term ‘entire.’ In fact the purpose of
adding the epithet ‘entire’ is to indicate that *Smṛtis* have their
source in the Veda. This we shall explain under Discourse II.

An objection is raised:—

&gt; “As a matter of fact, *Vidhi* is something in the form of what should
&gt; be done, expressed by the injunctive and such other verbal
&gt; expressions; and this, in all cases, must be directly expressed by
&gt; actual words; under the circumstances, what do you mean by saying that
&gt; there are two kinds of injunction,—that the term ‘one should offer’
&gt; denotes something to be done, and the procedure of the offering is
&gt; indicated by implication in the manner described above?”

There is no force in this objection. As a matter of fact, in the case of
the injunctive words ‘*nirvapet*,’ ‘should offer,’ ‘*yajeta*,’ ‘should
sacrifice’ and the like, even though what is expressed by the verbal
root itself may be comprehended, the full conception of *what is to he
done* is not obtained until we have comprehended the other factors,—such
as the character of the person fit for the performance, the procedure to
be adopted, and the actual details of the act to be performed; it is
only as equipped with all these factors that the Injunction becomes
comprehended in its complete form. In view of this fact, there is
nothing incongruous in regarding the said factors also as denoted by the
Injunctive word.

This is what the text means by the epithet ‘*achintya*,’
‘*inconceivable*’—which means ‘not directly perceptible.’ What is
directly perceived is said to be ‘apprehended,’ and not ‘conceived,’ or
‘remembred’ \[so that if the Veda were something directly perceived, the
epithet ‘inconceivable’ would have no force; things like the Veda can
only be *conceived of*, and the Veda isnot even that\].

‘*Not directly cognisable*;’—*i.e*., that which has got to be assumed or
inferred, as forming the source of several assertions made in the
*Smṛti*;as a matter of fact, such Vedic texts are not *perceived*, hence
it is called ‘not directly cognisable.’—Or ‘*not directly cognisable*’
may he taken in the sense of *incapable of having its extent exactly
defined*, by reason of its being very extensive; the Veda being divided
into several rescensions, cannot be exactly defined by all persons; and
on this account also it may be called ‘*inconceivable*;’ even in
ordinary parlance, people are found to say—‘what to say of others; this
cannot be even conceived of.’ The mind can conceive of all things; but
the Veda is so extensive that it cannot be conceived of even by the
mind. Thus the two epithets (‘inconceivable’ and ‘not directly
cognisable’) serve to indicate that the Veda is beyond the reach of the
internal as well as the external organs of perception; *i.e*., it is
very extensive; and this mention of the extensiveness of the Veda serves
as an inducement to the Teacher; the meaning being—‘it is you alone who
have learnt the Veda which is so extensive, hence you alone are
*conversant with what ought to be done, which forms the true import of
the said Veda*.’

The term ‘*Kārya*,’ ‘what ought to be done,’ stands for *the act to be
performed*; in reference to which the man is prompted to be the
*performer*, (in such terms as)—‘this should be done by you,’ ‘this
should not be done by you,’ ‘the Agnihotra should be performed’ ‘the
eating of the flesh of an animal killed by a poisoned arrow should not
be done.’ *Avoidance* also is a kind of ‘acting;’ *e.g*., the ‘non-doing
of Brāhmaṇa-murder’ constitutes the ‘performance’ or ‘acting’ of the
*avoidance* (of Brāhmaṇa-murder). *Activity* is ‘acting;’ so is also
‘desisting from activity;’ and the name ‘acting’ is not restricted to
only that which is accomplished by means of instruments and agents set
in motion; in fact, when such ‘acting’ is possible, if one desists from
it, this *desisting* also is ‘acting.’ For instance, when it is asserted
that ‘the man who takes wholesome food lives long,’ what is meant is
that the man who takes his food at the proper time, and who *does not
eat* at the improper time; as *desisting from eating* is also
‘wholesome.’

Or, the word ‘*Kārya*’ may be taken as indicating the Injunction and the
Prohibition; as these alone form the essence of the Veda; the other
parts of it, which are merely descriptive of certain happenings,—such
passages for instance as ‘he wept, and because he wept, he became known
as *Rudra*,’—are not *true*; they are not meant to be taken in their
literal sense, they are meant to be construed along with an injunctive
passage and serving the purpose of commending what has been laid down in
that injunctive passage. For instance, the descriptive passage just
quoted—beginning with ‘he wept’ and, ending with ‘there is weeping in
his house within a year’—is to be construed with the injunctive
passage—‘Therefore silver should not be placed on the grass;’ and being
deprecatory of the *placing of silver*, it serves the purpose of
commending the prohibition of that placing of silver. This is what is
meant by the dictum—‘the Veda is an authoritative source of knowledge in
regard to *what has to be accomplished*, and not *what is already
accomplished* and what is mentioned in the *Arthavāda* or Descriptive
Passages is what is already accomplished; and what is already
accomplished cannot be cognised as *something to be done*; what however
is cognised is that the description is supplementary to some injunction;
if then it were taken to be true in its own literal sense, it could not
be supplementary to any injunction; and this would militate against the
syntactical connection between the two passages—descriptive and
injunctive; and so long as two passages can be taken as syntactically
connected and constituting a single compound sentence, it is not right
to take them as two distinct sentences. \[The reverse process of taking
the injunction as supplementary to the description would not be right;
for\] as a matter of fact, what is yet to be accomplished could not be
subservient to what is already accomplished; specially because, if this
were so (and the in junction itself were not literally true), then the
Veda would contain no injunction of anything at all; and it would
thereby cease to be an authoritative source of knowledge. This would
involve the further incongruity, that we would have to deny the
well-recognised fact of the injunctive and other words denoting
*injunction*. It is with a view to all this that the revered Manu has
declared ‘something to be done’ as the ‘essence’ of the Veda. Jaimini
also in the *Pūrvamīmānsā-Sūtra* (1.1.2)—‘Duty is that desirable tiling
which is prescribed by the Vedic injunction’—has distinctly declared
that the Veda is an authoritative source of knowledge in regard to *what
is to be done*.

The term of address ‘Lord’ has been used on the understanding that the
personage addressed is well-known to be possessed of the capacity to
expound duty,—such capacity being due to his being endowed with a high
degree of knowledge of all things. The meaning thus is—‘O Lord, may you,
who are fully able to expound Duty, explain the Duties to us.’

Being thus questioned by means of the first three verses, he promised,
in the following verse, what he was asked to do. (3)

‘*Vidhānasya svayambhuvaḥ*’—Buhler has translated this phrase to mean
‘the ordinance of the self-existent’,—evidently taking ‘*Svayambhuvaḥ*’
as standing for God. This, however, is incompatible with the
interpretation of all the commentators, according to whom
‘*Svayambhuvaḥ*’ is in apposition to ’*Vidhānasya*’,—the phrase meaning
the ‘self-existent ordinance’, ‘the Eternal Law’ (the Veda). Burnell is
more to the point when he renders it as ‘self-existent system.’
Medhātithi (p. 5) has suggested another explanation—‘activity handed
down by immemorial tradition.’

‘*Aprameyasya*’—Though other commentatoss are satisfied with rendering
this epithet as meaning ‘unfathomable,’ Medhātithi imparts to it a
special significance by explaining it as ‘not directly knowable, but to
be inferred, as the foundation of the Smṛti.’

‘*Kāryatattvārtha*’—‘the purport and nature of the soul’ (Kullū.)—‘the
true purport’ (Medhātithi, Govinda and Nandana)

It is noteworthy that Medhātithi has supplied, under verse 11 below, a
totally different explanation of this verse.

<div class="js_include collapsed" newlevelforh1="4" title="गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः" unfilled url="/kalpAntaram/smRtiH/manuH/gangAnatha-bhAShyAnuvAdaH/01_praveshaH/004_sa_taiH.md">

‘*He*’—Manu—‘*possessed of illimitable being thus questioned by the
high-souled Great Sages, answered them*—“*Listen*.”’

‘*Thus*’—in the aforesaid manner; the word ‘thus’ which denotes
*method*, includes the *matter* as well as the *manner* of the question;
hence ‘*thus questioned*’ means ‘thus questioned, *i.e*., questioned
about Duties—he answered.’

Or, the word ‘thus’ may be taken as denoting *manner* only. As a matter
of fact, however the word ‘*questioned*’ already brings to the mind the
details (matter as well as manner) of what has been questioned about;
hence the meaning is—‘what he was questioned about, that he answered
thus the *question* and the *answer* come to have the same objective.

Under this explanation the word ‘thus’ become super fluous, and only
serves the purpose of filling the gap in the metre. Under the former
explanation however, the word ‘thus’ itself serves the purpose of
showing that the ‘questioning’ and the ‘answering’ have both the same
objective.

The word ‘*Samyak*,’ ‘*with proper courtesy*,’qualifies the *answering*:
‘he answered with proper courtesy’—*i.e., gladly*, not with anger or any
other form of displeasure.

‘*Possessed of inimitable vigour*’—with undiminished power of speech; he
whose vigour,’ power, capacity of exposition, is ‘illimitable,’
infinite.

The epithet ‘*high-souled*,’ serves to show that there is no
incompatibility in the persons being ‘Great Sages,’ and at the same time
‘questioners’ (as if they themselves did not know what they were asking
about); hence it is said ‘he answered the Great Sages.’ It is the
philanthropic person that is called ‘high-souled,’ hence the meaning is
that though they themselves knew all about Duties,—otherwise they would
not be ‘Great Sages,’—yet they questioned Manu for the benefit of other
people; the idea in their minds being as follows—‘Manu is a Sage whose
authoritative character is better known,—what he says is always
respected by people,—he is always approached with trust and
confidence,—hence for the expounding of the treatise, we shall make him
our Teacher’,—and when he is questioned by us, he will be regarded by
the people as still more trustworthy.’

It is this explanation that justifies the statement in the text
regarding Manu having ‘*received them with reverence*.’ If it were not
as we have explained, what would be the meaning of the ‘reverence’ shown
by the Teacher to the Pupil? The word of the text which means ‘having
received with reverence’ must be explained as a participle formed of the
root ‘*arc*’ (to worship) with the prefix ‘*ā*’ and the participial
affix ‘*lyap*’ \[as without the prefix, the form would be
‘*arcayitvā*’\]. Another reading (which removes the difficulty) is
‘*tān*.’

In connection with the present verse, the following question has been
raised—“If the whole of this Treatise has been composed by Manu himself,
it is not right to attribute it to another person, as is done in the
statement—‘being questioned by them, *he* answered’; the proper form
would have been—‘being questioned by them, I answered.’ If, on the other
hand, someone else is the author of the Treatise, then why should it be
called ‘*Mānava*’ (of Manu)?”

There is no force in this objection. In the first place, it is a well
known fact that in most cases the authors of Treatises state their own
views as if emanating from other persons,—making use of such expressions
as—‘in this connection *they say*’ or ‘*they* meet this argument thus,’
and so forth; and the form ‘being questioned by them *I* answered’ would
not be in keeping with such usage; the reason underlying this fact is
that the older the person the more authoritative he is regarded to be by
the people; it is for this reason that we find Jaimini (1.1.5) stating
his own view as emanating from ‘Bādarāyaṇa.’

Or (another explanation is that) the Treatise is a compilation made and
related by Bhṛgu; and since the original *Smṛti* \[which is, in the
present Treatise related by Bhṛgu\] was compiled (from teachings
received directly from Prajāpati) by Manu,—it is styled ‘*Manava*’ (of
Manu).

He answered the great sages;—what was the answer?—‘Listen to what I have
been questioned about.’ (4).

Prajāpati himself;—He taught them to Manu, who composed the ‘ordinance’,
and taught it to the sages, among whom was Bhṛgu, who was commissioned
