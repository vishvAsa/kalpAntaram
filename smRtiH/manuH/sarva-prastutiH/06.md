The term ‘*gṛhāśrama*’ means that ‘*āśrama*’, *life-stage* which is
characterised by the ‘*gṛha*’, *house*,—*i.e*., the *presence of the
wife*.

Having ‘*lived*’ there,—*i.e*., having duly fulfilled the duties of that
stage of life—he should dwell in, the forest. This is the injunction
here set forth.

The affix in ‘*sthitvā*’, ‘having lived’, indicates the priority of the
Householder’s life to that of the Hermit; and the meaning is that one
should proceed from, stage to stage in the right order; it is only one
who has lived the Householder’s life that is entitled to the forest-life
of the Hermit.

What is said here is in accordance with the view that a man should pass
through each and all the four stages. There is however the other view
that from the life of the purely celebate student also one can proceed
at once to the forest-life; as is going to be described later on.

‘*With* *his* *organs under subjection* ’—with his impurities washed
off, his passions calmed down.

The phrases ‘*according to law*’ and ‘*in the proper manner*’ have been
added only for the purpose of filling up the metre; as we have already
explained in several places.

All that is meant to be enjoined here is that ‘having completed the
Householder’s life, he shall betake himself to the life in the
forest.’—(1).

**(verses 6.1-2)  
**

*Gautama* (3.1).—‘Some people declare that he who has studied the Veda
may make his choice regarding the particular stage that he will enter.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.11.14).—‘A hermit is one who regulates his conduct
according to the institutes proclaimed by Vikhānas.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.1-2, 18-10).—‘There are four stages—that of the
Householder, that of the Student, that of the Renunciate and that of the
Hermit. If he lives in all these four according to the law, without
allowing himself to he disturbed, he will obtain salvation. Only after
completing studentship shall he go forth as a Hermit.’

*Āpastamba*. (2.22.78).—‘After having finished the study of the Veda,
having taken a wife and kindled the sacred fires, he shall begin the
rites ending with the Soma-sacrifices, performing as many as are
prescribed in the Veda:—afterwards he shall build a dwelling outside the
village and dwell there with his children and wife.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.8).—‘After having fulfilled the duties of the Student,
he shall go forth as a Renunciate.’

*Āpastamba* (2.24.14).—‘He may accomplish his objects as he pleases;
there is no reason to place any one order before the other.’

*Viṣṇu* (94.1-2).—‘A householder, when he sees his skin wrinkled and his
hair turned grey, must go to live in a forest; or when he sees the son
of his son.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.45).—‘Entrusting his wife to his sons, or accompanied
by his wife, the Hermit, taking the vow of celibacy, shall repair to the
forest, along with his tires and the *Upāsanās*.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 940).—‘Having lawfully begotten children, having
performed the sacrifices to the best of his ability, and having seen his
son’s child, the Brāhmaṇa shall repair to the forest.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Do.).—‘Having begotten children, having performed
their sacraments, taught them the Veda, provided them with the means of
living, united them to their wives, entrusting his family to his son,
and making preparations for departure, he should have recourse to
special means of livelihood. In due course, after having passed through
the *Yāyāvara* stage, he should repair to the forest.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘faking with himself the sacrificial implements, the
sacred fire, the cows and other accessories, and accompanied by his
wife, the twice-born man shall repair to the forest.’

*Jābāla* (Parāśaramādhava, Ācāra, p. 525).—‘Having completed religious
studentship, one shall become a Householder; after having become a
House-holder, he shall go out.’

*Chāgalega* (Do., p. 526).—‘Being without his wife, he shall deposit his
fire in himself, and the Brāhmaṇa shall go out of his house.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.17.2-5)—‘Some teachers say that he who has finished his
studentship may become a renunciate immediately on the completion of
that; hut according to others, renunciation is fit only for those
*Śālīnas* and *Yāyāvaras* who are childless, or a widower; in general
they prescribe renunciation after the completion of the seventieth year,
after the children have been finally settled in their sacred duties.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (7.1-3).—‘There are four orders: the Student, the
Householder, the Hermit and the Renunciate; a man who has studied one,
two or three Vedas without violating the rules of studentship may enter
any of these, whichsoever he pleases.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.27-28).—‘The duties of the Hermit are to keep matted
hair, to perform Agnihotra, to sleep on the bare ground, to wear black
deer-skin, to live in solitary places, to sustain himself on water,
succulent roots, Nīvāra corn and fruits, to refuse alms, to bathe
thrice, to observe vows and to adore gods and guests.’

It has been said before that the person who is entitled to the life of
the Hermit is only one who has abandoned all longing for the objects of
sense: and this is what the author is explaining now.

‘*Wrinkles*’—Looseness of skin.

‘*Greyness*’—the whiteness of the hair.

‘*Child’s child*.’—They explain this to mean ‘son’s son And cultured
people have held that this rule does not apply if the man has only a son
born to his daughter, or a daughter born to his son.

Others however have taken the ‘greyness of hair’ and ‘birth of the
grandchild’ only as indicative of *old age. So* that even if an old
man’s hairs may not, for some reason, become grey, he should, at the
approach of old age, retire to the forest. Just as the person who has
got a son and has his hairs still block is entitled to the ‘kindling of
fire so is the man who has got a grandson and has his head turned grey
entitled to the Hermit’s life. And in the former case also ‘the birth of
the son’ end ‘blackness of hair’ are only indicative of a certain age.

Some people have taken the text to mean that ‘*one* should retire into
the forest *neither too early nor too late in life*.’ But in is
necessary to find out an authority for this.—(2).

“Medhātithi notes that the Śiṣṭas insist on the necessity that he who
takes to forest-life must have sons and son’s sons, and that hence
‘*apatya*’, ‘offspring,’ is to be taken in this restricted sense (of
*grandson*, not *grand-daughter*);—Nārāyaṇa holds that the verse gives
three separate grounds for entering the third order, each of which is
sufficient in itself; while Medhātithi thinks that the three conditions
must exist together—\[There is nothing in Medhātithi to indicate this\].
‘Others,’ mentioned by Medhātithi, took the verse to give a description
of the approach of old age, which entitles the house-holder to turn
hermit”—Buhler.

Medhātithi mentions,—but with disapproval—another explanation, by which
the whole verse serves only to indicate that one should take to the
hermit’s life neither ‘too early’ nor ‘too late.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* to the effect that one should retire
to the forest either when he has become decrepit with old age, or has
got a grandson in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 527);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 131);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 68b).

From this time onward he shall not eat any food consisting of barley,
paddy and the like;—this is what is meant by ‘*hav* - *ing given up*’.
This is what has been described as ‘living on roots.’

‘*Belonging*’—Consisting of cows, houses, clothing, seats and beds, etc.

If the wife wishes it, then they should go away together; Otherwise he
shall go alone. Others explain the text to mean that if the wife is
still young he shall commit her to his sons, and if she is old, he is to
take her with himself.

It is only when the wife is there that there can be any rule regarding
her either being made over to the sons or going to the forest with her
husband. If the wife has died, then also the man should retire to the
forest, as declared by Āpastamba and others, in connection with the
‘Re-kindling of Fire.’

Only that man can be a Hermit whose senses are not too mobile;
otherwise, he should take another wife; such is the established
rule.—(3).

*Gautama* (3.26).—‘A hermit shall live in the forest subsisting on roots
and fruits, practising austerities; he shall kindle the fire under the
*Śramaṇaka rules*, he shall eat wildgrowing vegetables only.’

of all castes, except those intercourse with whom is forbidden; he may
even use the flesh of animals killed by carnivorous beasts; he shall not
step on ploughed land; and he shall not enter a village; he shall wear
his hair in braids and dress in bark or skins; he shall not eat anything
that has been hoarded more than a year.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.18-21).—‘Now follow the rules regarding the hermit
living in the woods;—only after completing studentship shall he go
forth, remaining chaste. He shall keep one fire only, have no house,
enjoy no pleasures, have no protector, observe silence, uttering speech
on the occasion of the daily recitation of the Veda only.’

*Viṣṇu* (94.3).—‘Let him entrust the care of his wife to his sous, or
let her accompany him.’

self-controlled, he shall maintain, with things obtained without

*Vaśiṣṭha* (9.4).—‘He shall gather wild-growing roots and fruits only.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 30).—‘For the hermit—celibacy, sleeping on the ground,

*Skin*—of the bull, the deer and other such animals.

‘*Cīra*’—a bit of cloth.

^(‘)*Evening*’—end of the day.

‘*Morning*’—opening of the day.

This rule regarding bathing in the evening implies that the man is to
eat at night only; because Bathing after meals is forbidden.

This view, some say, is not right; because among the observances of the
Accomplished Student, it is said that ‘after taking his food he shall
bathe’ (which shows that bathing after meals is not entirely forbidden),
in fact this bathing after meals is declared in the *Mahābhārata* as to
be done by each and every person.

It is open to the Hermit to bathe thrice during the day—this being a
matter of option.

‘*Matted locks*, *beard, hairs on the body and nails*’;—all this he

It has been said that ‘food fit for hermits’ should be used; this
consists of wild grains, such as *Nīvāra* and the rest, and of
wild-growing herbs, etc. The term ‘*anna*’, ‘food’, is generally used in
the sense of some *preparation of grains*,— such as rice, fried flour,
cake and so forth; and it is for this reason that, though herbs, &c.,
also are ‘food fit for hermits’, they have been mentioned separately.
‘Hermits’ are ascetics, and their food is called ‘food fit for hermits.’
And what is meant (by verse 5) is that the man should perform the Five
Sacrifices, which are duties related to cooking on the household fire.
This might give rise to the notion that when the man lives upon ripe
season-fruits (and does not cook his food) he should not offer the said
sacrifices: it is with a view to preclude such a notion that the Text
adds—‘*what he eats*’; the meaning is that whatever, in the shape of
flour, &.c., be eats, that he should offer to the best of his capacity.

‘*Offerings*’— apart for the Agnihotra-libations; those that are laid
down as to be made.to ‘*Indra*’ ‘*Indrapuruṣa*’ and so forth.

In this view, there are no offerings poured into the fire,—they say.

But this is not right; as the term ‘*bali*’, ‘offering’, is a generic
name for all kinds of oblations; and hence it stands equally for those
offered into the fire, and those not offered Into the fire.

If the right view to hike were this that⁽one shall offer only what he
eats;—and that also into the file only,—and that offerings into the fire
must consist of *cooked* food then the hermit would cook just that much
herb, &c. as would be needed for the offerings, and he himself would cat
the ripe fruits of the season. Even for one who lives upon
season-fruits, it is necessary to offer the *Vaiśvadeva* oblations into
fire.

The compound in the second line is a copulative one, formed of ‘*ap*’,
‘water’, and the rest; the meaning being that ‘the traveller that
happens to come to his hermitage he shall honour with water, roots,
fruits and alms—consisting of *Nīvāra* and other grains’.—(7).

This being a distinct stage of life, people might think that such duties
as Vedic Study and the like, which pertain to other life-stages, should
have to be omitted now; hence with a view to show that they do not
cease, the Text has added—‘*always engaged*’; and not as in the
Householder’s stage, during which, the man being busy with his household
work, their performance leaves no time for Vedic study and such duties.

‘*Meek*’—endowed with humility; free from haughtiness.

‘*Conciliatory*’—abounding in the friendly spirit; always saying what is
agreeable and wholesome; ever ready to conciliate his neighbour.

‘*Quiet*.’—Even when urged by others, he should not speak much of what

‘*Not accepting* any *gifts*’—He should not beg anything for his
medication or diet and such needs, from a person belonging to another

‘*Compassionate towards all living beings*’—‘Compassion’ is *pity*. But
even though he be compassionate, he should not, for the sake of any

‘*Vitāna*’, *is vihāra*, *sacrifice*; what pertains to it is
‘*sacrificial*’, ‘*vaitānikam*’; *i.e*., the rites pertaining to the
Three Fires this he shall ‘*offer*’, perform.

The term ‘*agnihotra*’ primarily denotes the wild barley and other
substances that are employed in sacrificial oblations; and it is not the
name of a particular rite; it is in this sense that we have the term
used as the object of the verb ‘*shall offer*’; and we get at the
meaning that ‘he shall offer, by means of the *Agnihotra* and other
rites, the oblations into the *Āhavanīya Fire*;’—it is in this way that
the use of the verb ‘*juhuyāt*’, ‘*shall offer*’ becomes justified. In
this explanation the word ‘*agnihotra*’ becomes synonymous with the
denotation of the root ‘*hu*’, ‘to offer into the fire.’

*Objection*—“The text has just prescribed the optional alternative of
committing his wife to his sons; in this case how can the man, in the
absence of his wife, be entitled to the performance of *śrauta* rites?
It might be said that ‘the man would be entitled to them in the same way
as the man away from home is entitled; just as the man who is away from
home, though at a distance from the Fires, is regarded as the
*performer* of the rituals by reason of his having made arrangements for
the offerings to be made by a proper substitute, in the same manner, in
the case in question, when the man is starting for the forest, his wife
shall permit him to carry on the rituals; and in this manner the joint
character of the title would not be disturbed.’ But this cannot be
right. The procedure of employing a substitute is permissible only in
cases where the man is forced by human or divine agencies to go away
from home, and not when he goes out of his own accord. Because in such a
procedure, many of the details would become omitted, even though the man
would be perfectly capable to accomplish them (if he himself remained at
home); *e.g*. in connection with the *Darśa-Paurnamāsa* sacrifices it is
laid down that the *sacrificer* shall *make his wife repeat* the
*mantra* ‘*vedo-si vittirasi*, &c.’; and this would be omitted (during
the sacrificer’s absence).

“It might be said that the rule laid down in the present verse may be
taken as pertaining to the case where the householder is retiring to the
forest *along with his wife* (and not when he is going alone, leaving
her in charge of his sons). But this also is not possible; because we do
not find any such restrictive specification. Further in connection with
the contigency of leaving the wife behind, the scriptures have
prescribed another method of disposing of the Fires (in the shape of the
direction that they should be committed to the charge of the wife.)

“Then again, even if the rule wore taken as pertaining to cases where
the wife accompanies the husband, the following direction (contained in
verse 11) would not be relevant—‘With pure grains, fit for hermits,
which grow in spring and in autumn, and which he has himself collected,
he shall prepare the cakes and the boiled messes, according to law’;—the
grains meant here are the wild ones, *Nīvāra* and the like, because he
has been directed to relinquish all his village-belongings; and yet in
the Veda cakes are laid down as to be made of *Vrīhi* and other grains,
which are *cultivated*. Nor could the rite be completed by using any
other pure grain, either in accordance with the maxim that ‘whatever is
produced may be used’ (‘*Utpannanyāya*’), or in accordance with the law
of options (*Vrīhi-nyāya*). Because any such grains it would be
difficult for the wife to obtain. Lastly, the performance of the
*Agnihotra* being a life-long duty, how can there be any relinquishing
of that rite, or of the wife? From all this it is clear that the rule
regarding the entering into the next stage of life is not compatible
with the performance of the Sacrificial Acts.”

On this point a special effort has to be made (for reconciling the
apparent discrepancy).

\(A\) Some people say that the term ‘sacrificial’ in the text has been
used, by way of praise, for the *smārta* (not *śrauta*) rites; and in
connection with the *smārta* rites there are no such scriptural
restrictions as that cakes should be made of the *Vrīhi* and other
*cultivated* grains only. In fact in connection with these rites it has
been declared that—The deities of a man partake of the same food as the
man himself’ (Vālmiki-Rāmāyaṇa *Ajodhyā kāṇḍa*). So that there would be
nothing wrong if the Hermit performed these rites with ‘grains fit for
the hermit.’ Even if this were incompatible with the injunctions
regarding the use of *Vrīhi* and other cultivated grains, this
incompatibility could be easily explained away.

“But even in this case there would be the law relating to the joint
right of the husband and wife to the performance, which would be
infringed by the man doing it when separated from his wife.”

Well, as regards the Vedic declaration—‘One shall offer sacrifices, when
accompanied by his wife.’—this can pertain to *śrauta* rites only so
that the said difficulty does not arise in connection with the *smārta*
rites.\]

\(B\) Another explanation is that the rule laid down in the present
verse does not refer to the Householder’s Fire at all; it refers to what
has been prescribed by Gautama (3.27) regarding ‘the kindling of fire in
the month of *Śrāvaṇa*.’ In the present treatise also, the author is
going to add the phrase ‘following the methods of the hermit’ (Verse
21). From all this it is clear that the rites referred to here are those
that have been prescribed in the scriptures, as entirely apart from the
rites relating to the Agnihotra, &c. And the terms ‘*Darśa*’ and
‘*Paurṇamāsa*’ too have been used only figuratively. Thus the said
kindling of the Fire by the Hermit is to be done by him, without his
wife. As regards the household Fires of the *Agnihotra*, the method of
disposing of them is laid down (in verse 25 below) in the
words—^(‘)Having reposited the sacrificial fires in himself, &c. &c.’

As regards the contention based upon the life-long character of tbs
*Agnihotra-* rite, that the abandoning of the Fires cannot be right,—we
shall deal with this when we are considering the question of the
sequence among the four life stages.

\(C\) Others again explain as follows:—What has been forbidden for the
Hermit is the act of offering oblations of cultivated grains, and not
that of employing these for the sake of the Deities.

“But the sacrificer has got to eat of what is offered to the gods,
according to the law that the four priests, with the sacrificer as the
fifth, partake of the sacrificial cake.”

True; but that *eating* is one that is prescribed by the scriptures, and
not the ordinary one; and what has been forbidden under verse is the
*ordinary* eating. And for purposes of the scriptural act, even if the
man were to go into the village, there would he nothing wrong in this;
in fact it is going to be declared below (verse 28) that—‘he may eat the
food after having obtained it from the village.’

This however is not right; because of the express injunction that he is
to make use of only such grains as are^(‘)fit for hermits.’

Thus we find that the whole explanation regarding the *text* referring
to the fire kindled during the month of *Śrāvaṇa* (explanation B above),
and all that follows is not acceptable.

Further, verse 4 has spoken of the man^(‘)*taking with himself* the
sacred fire’,—and not *leaving it behind*. As for its being committed to
another person, it is going to be laid down that it is to be done either
by the man who is going to die, or who is going out for the first time.
Then again, the *Turayāṇa* and other rites that are prescribed (in verse
10) for the Hermit (and which are all *Śrauta* rites to be performed in
the *Śrauta* Fire of the *Agnihotra*) cannot be explained, if the
present verse refers to the fresh *Smārta* fire kindled in *Śrāvana*. In
fact, this latter Fire-kindling could be done only by one whose wife has
died,—such being the implication of the actual words laying it down. Or,
it may be done in a case where the man retires to the forest immediately
after Studentship-

From all this it follows that when an *Agnihotrin* retires to the
forest, he shall do so along with the Fire, and accompanied by his wife.

In the forest, the rites are to be performed ‘according to law’, with
*Vrīhi* and other grains; and these grains (though belonging to *the
cultivated* category) may somehow or other be brought under the category
(if ‘grains fit for hermits.’ Specialty as *Vrīhi* and *Yava* (which are
*cultivated* grains) are (quite sacred.

For the man who has not maintained the Fire, the duty of ‘committing the
Fires to his wife’ may be accomplished somehow with reference to the
Fire kindled according to *smārta* rules. This would be only right, as
both are ‘*smārta*’ acts. In the case of a man who has two wives, and
one of these has taken charge of the Fires, the ‘committing of the wife
to the children’ would apply to the second wife.

‘*Not omitting*.’—‘Omission’ is disobeying the Injunction; the
non-performance of an act in the form in which it has been prescribed.
This has been added only for the purpose of filling up the metre;
similarly also the term ‘*yogaṭaḥ*’, ‘*taking care*.’ The construction
is ‘*yogataḥ askandayan*’, ‘*taking care not to omit*’, *i.e*.,
carefully keeping up. The^(‘)care’ here refers to the injunction
ittelf—(9).

If the phrase ‘*grains fit for hermits*’ is not connected with what has
gone before, then there is no room for the objection—“how can the
sacrificial offerings be made, which are laid down as to consist of
*Vrīhi* and other cultivated grains?”

The ‘boiled mess’ and ‘cake’ meant here are those that have been
prescribed by the rules laid down for Hermits.

‘*Vāsanta*’—those that grow, or ripen, during spring; similarly
‘*śārada*’.

^(‘)*Sacred*’—this is a mere re-iteration.

^(‘)*Which he has himself gathered*’.—This forbids such means of
livelihood as receiving gifts and the like. For the due fullilment of
the aforesaid s *mārta* rites, grains have to be gathered by wandering
hither and thither.

‘*According to law*’, ‘*severally*’.—Both these terms are added for
filling up the metre.—(11).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.46), which notes that even
though the ‘*munyanna*’ is by nature pure, yet the text has added the
epithet ‘*medhya*’ with a view to indicate that the grains should be
*fit for being offered at a sacrifice*;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 528), which explains ‘*munyanna*’ as ‘uncultivated grains,’ and
‘*medhya*’ as ‘fit for being offered at sacrifices.’

‘*Bhaumāni Kavakāni*’.—The term ‘*kavaka*’ has already been explained
(under 5.5) as a synonym of ‘*chatraka*’ (mushrooms). These mushrooms
grow on the ground, as also in the hollow of trees and other places.
Hence the specification ‘land-grown’.

This however would appear to be contrary to usage; specially as among
the duties of the Householder, all kinds of mushroom have been
forbidden, and for the Hermit, the discipline, if anything, should be
stricter.

For this reason the term ‘*bhaumāni*’ should be taken separately by
itself; and it should be understood us standing for the ‘*gojihvikā*’
(cabbage), which is well-known among foresters,—and not for *anything
grown on the land*.

Mushrooms having been already forbidden before, their repented
prohibition in the present text is for the purpose of indicating that
the eating of the fragrant grass and other things involves the same
Expiatory Rite as that of mushrooms.

‘*Bhustṛṇa*’ (fragrant grass) and ‘*shigruka*’ (pot-herb) are the names
of particular kinds of herbs well known among cultivators—(14).

‘*Bhaumāni kavakāni*’—Medhātithi prefers to take the two
separately—‘*bhaumāni*’ being ‘the vegetable known among foresters’ as
‘*gojihvikā*’ and ‘*kavakāni*’ as ‘mushrooms’;—Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa take the two together ‘mushrooms growing on the ground.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 942);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*

This throwing away of the food during the month of *Āśvina* is
applicable to cases where the man is either one who lays by provision
for six months or for one who does it for a year.

“As a rule hermits’ food should be collected only in such quantities as
may be actually needed for the rites to be performed; so that there can
be no surplus; under the circumstances, what would be there to be thrown
away?”

The answer to this is as follows At the time that the man is gathering
food he cannot always keep a weighing balance in his hand; hence it is
quite possible that some small quantities may be left over; and it is
these that have to be thrown away during the month of *Āśvina*.

‘*Worn out clothes*’.—There is no throwing away of such clothes as are
not worn out.—(15).

Of forest-grown things also, those ‘produced by ploughing’ are
forbidden; while things grown in villages, even though not ‘produced by
ploughing’, have been already forbidden by verse 3 above; the present
fresh prohibition is meant for flowers and fruits, and this prohibition
applies to the use of village-grown flowers and fruits in the
worshipping of gods &c.

‘*Even though he be in distress*’.—That is, even though nothing else be
available, and the worshipping of gods be absolutely necessary,—these
things shall not be used even as substitutes.

The term ‘*api*’, ‘*even*’, should be construed away from where it

‘*One living on food cooked by fire*’.—One whose food consists of
vegetables and rice &c. cooked by fire.

Or he may rat only such fruits of trees as ripen themselves in their
season.

Or his food may consist of flour obtained by grinding *nīvāra* and other
grains. That is, he should grind these grains, and having thus turned
them into dough, eat. it.

Or this phrase may mean that those nuts that ripen in their own season,
and which have a kernel beneath a hard crust,—the outer crust of these
should be broken with stone and the inner kernel eaten.

‘*Dantolūkhalikaḥ*’.—One who has his teeth for the mortar. That is the
outer crust of nuts may be removed with the teeth. This however ought
not to be done even though the nut may have been cleaned.

Or the phrase may be taken as qualifying the eating; the sense being
that—‘he shall eat in such a way that his teeth may serve the purposes
of the mortar, in the thumping and removing of chaff’.—(17).

*Bodhāyana* (3.3.1-3, 9-12),—‘Hermits belong to two classes—those who
cook, and those who do not cook, food;—those who cook are of five
kinds—those who eat everything that the forest contains, those who live
on unhusked grain, those who eat bulbs and roots, those who eat fruits
and those who eat pot-herbs. Those who do not cook are of five
kinds—those who avoid the use of iron and other implements, those who
ṭake food with the band, those who take it with the mouth, those who
subsist on water only, and those who live on air only.’

*Viṣṇu* (95, 14, 15).—‘He shall break his food with stones; or he shall
use his teeth as a pestle.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3, 49).—‘He shall use his teeth as the pestle; or he may

*Gautuma* (3.35).—‘He shall not eat anything that has been hoarded for
more than a year.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.11.15).—(See under 3.)

*Baudhāyana* (3.2.11-18)—‘As regards the mode of life called
*Samprakṣālanī*, in order to see that there is no waste of the
substances obtained, nor any hoarding, he overturns the dishes and
washes them. In the mode called *Samūhā*, he sweeps up grain with a
broom in permitted places where grain-bearing plants are found, either
on a road or in fields, access to which is not obstructed, and lives on
what is thus obtained. In the mode called *Pālanī*, which is also called
*Ahiṃsakā*, he tries to obtain from virtuous men husked rice or seeds
and maintains himself thereby. In the mode called *Śiloñcha*, he gleans
single ears of corn in permitted places where grainbearing plants grow,
or on roads, or in fields, access to which is not obstructed, and
supports himself by these gleanings, collected from time to time. In the
method called *Kapota*, he picks up with two fingers single grains in
permitted places where grain-bearing plants grow, either on the road or
in fields, access to which is not obstructed; this is acting like a
pigeon, *Kapota*. In the mode called *Siddhoñcha*, tired with other
modes of subsistence, and because he has become old or diseased, he asks
virtuous men for cooked food. If he subsists on the produce of the
forest, of trees, creepers and lianas and grasses, such as wild millet
and wild sesamum, that is called *forest-life*.’

*Āpastamba* (2.23.1).—‘If he desires to perform great austerities, he
shall collect food only day by day, in the morning, in his vessel.’

*Viṣṇu* (94.11).—‘He should collect provisions, after the manner of the
pigeon, for a month; or he should collect them for a year.’

Two meals having been prescribed for the man’s ordinary purposes, the
present text lays down the dropping of one of these meals for the
Hermit. The sense is that as age goes on advancing, the man should go on
dropping the mealtimes one by one. The ‘fourth’ meal-time is to be
computed in the same manner us the ‘eighth’: Three days having elapsed,
if one eats in the evening of the fourth day, he comes to be regarded as
eating ‘*every eighth time*’. The act of *eating* being the
subject-matter of the context, the ‘fourth’ (or ‘eighth’) time has to be
taken as referring to that act.—(19).

‘*Rolling about*’— Lying down on the ground on one side for sometime and
then turning over on the other side. He shall pass his time thus rolling
about, except during meal-time and the time during which he has to move
about, he shall neither sit down nor walk about, nor sit on a bed, or a

such reservoir of water is not available, one may perform his bath even

‘*Vaitāna*’—*Śrauta*.

These fires he shall reposit within himself, by swallowing their ashes
and perfoming such other rites as have been laid down in connection with
it. The exact procedure of this *repositting* should be learnt from the
*Śravanaka* (?).

When austerities have been performed for a long time, and the man has
reached seventy years of age, then, still remaining a hermit, he shall
be ‘*without fires and without a house*’; *i.e*., he shall give up his
thatched dwelling-house.

“Where then should be live?”

He shall dwell ‘*at the roots of trees*’,—as is going to be said in the
next verse.

‘*He shall be a silent hermit’.—The* construction is ‘*muniḥ* *syāt*’,
‘he shall be a *muni*’; which means that he shall keep his speech under
control; the man who has his speech under control is called ‘a keeper of
the vow of silence’.

‘*Living upon roots and fruits*’.— This serves to exclude all other
kinds of food; he shall not eat even *Nīvarā* and the other wild
grains.—(25).

‘*Yathāvidhi*’—‘By swallowing the ashes and so forth’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘by repeating the vedic text, Taittirīya
Saṃhitā 2.5.8.8’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 944), which explains ‘*niketa*’
as ‘home’,—‘*muni*’ as ‘observing silence,’—and adds that alms should be
begged only in the event of his being unable to obtain wild fruits and
roots,—as is clear from what follows in verse 27 below.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.54), which explains ‘*muniḥ*’ as
‘observing the vow of silence’; and adds that in the event of his being
unable to get roots and fruits, he may beg from the houses of other
hermits, just enough to keep himself alive.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 531).

He shall make no effort to obtain things that give pleasure; *e.g*.,
troubled by heat, he shall not move into the shade, and troubled by
cold, he shall not kindle fire. If, however, his sufferings are removed
by such natural causes as the falling of the sun’s rays and the
like,—this is not forbidden. This rule refers to seasons other than the
rains; because special rules have been prescribed with special reference
to this latter Reason.

Or, the text may be taken as prohibiting the use of medicines by the
hermit if he happen to fall ill,—being cured of disease also being a
kind of ‘pleasure;’ hence he shall not make any effort to secure this
pleasure.

‘*Sleeping on the ground*’;—*i.e*., he shall sleep on the ground,
covered only with grass.

‘*Shelter*’— dwelling-places, such as houses, tree-roots and so
forth;—for these he shall not care; he shall not have any hankering
after the possession of these.

He shall make the roots of trees his dwelling. In the event of their
being not available, stone-slabs, mountain-caves and such places have
also been ordained for him.—(26).

It has just been stated in general terms that ‘he shall attend to
*others*’; this might be taken to imply the propriety of practising the
restraints and observances laid down in the ‘*Śākya*’,
the^(‘)*Pāśupata*’ and other heterodox scriptures. Hence the present
verse is added for the purpose precluding these.

‘*By sages*.’—The *Mahābhārata* describes several restraints and
observances practised by the ancient sages.

Those attended to by ‘*Brāhmaṇa-householders*’;—as has been declared
under Gautama (3.9)—This refers to those coming later, also, because
there is no incompatibility in this.’

‘*Knowledge*’—the realising of the unity of the Self; this one should
‘*advance*’—confirm, strengthen—by the study of the Veda.

‘*For the purification of the body*’—he should attend to the restraints
relating to the regulation of food—(30).

The ‘*Aparājitā*’ is the name of the North-Easterly direction, known
among the people as ‘*Aiśānī*’;—‘*Having fixed upon*’ this direction—as
“this is the direction towards which I shall go’,—he should proceed
towards it.

‘*Moving straight on*’—not swerving from his path, not seeking to avoid
even rivers and streams. This is a rule laying down the going towards
the North-East.

‘*Intent*, *living upon water and air, till the falling off of the
body*.’—That is, until the body falls off, he shall live upon air and on
water.

‘*Intent*’,—having concentrated himself by the rules of Yoga.

This refers to the ‘Grand Journey’ (towards certain death).—(31).

‘*Yuktaḥ*’—‘Intent on the practice of yoga’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka),—‘firmly resolved’ (Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānaṇda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 945), which adds the following
notes:—‘*yuktaḥ*’ means ‘*samāhitaḥ*’, ‘intent, calm, collected’; this
teaching regarding the ‘Great Journey’ is only by way of an illustration
for all such means of self-immolation as burning, drowning and the like.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.55);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1660), which explains ‘*aparājitā*’ as ‘the north-easterly
direction,’—towards that he should go straight on, till his body falls,
living upon water and air and with mind duly concentrated and calm.

The austerities spoken of above and the ‘Grand Journey’ just spoken of
constitute ‘*the methods adopted by the Great Sages*.’ By ‘*one of
these*’—by drowning in a river, by falling from a precipice, by burning
one self by fire, by starving one’self to death—one should discard his
body.

The result of this is that ‘with sorrow and fear departed’ he reaches
the regions of Brahman. ‘*Sorrow*’ consists in the experiencing of the
sufferings of hell, etc.,—^(‘)*Fear*’—of going to hell. Both these
disappear for the man; and directly—not having to pass through the
several stages of Light, etc.—he goes to the region of Brahman.

The ‘*region of Brahman*’ is a particular place, superior than Heaven
itself; and in that ‘*he becomes exalted*’—remains to honoured. This
does not mean that he obtains the ‘Selfsovereignty’ of Brahman; since
the text distinctly adds the term ‘region’; specially as Liberation is
going to be spoken as being led to from the *fourth* Life-stage.

They say that Liberation is not attained by mere Action.

But this is not right; since in this very work it has been said—‘he
should study the Vedic texts contained in the Upaniṣads in order to
attain the Self’; and ‘attainment of the Self’ is nothing more than
*meditating*,’ *upon the Self and thereby becoming absorbed in it*;
there can be no other meaning of the term ‘attain’. And further what is
to be meditated upon by *yogins* in connection with the Upaniṣad-texts
is the Self:—‘One fixed in Brahman reaches immortality’, ‘he becomes
absorbed therein’ and so forth.

It might be argued that—“there are other forms of success proceeding
from austerities, spoken of in such texts as ‘if he is desirous of
reaching the regions of the Pitṛs etc. etc.’; wherein we find it stated
that man can attain that degree of greatness which belongs to Brahman,
and which is acquired by his determined activity; but this cannot be
*Liberation*.”

But this is not right. Because there is no distinction made. The man of
action is just as much entitled to ‘Immortality’ (which is Liberation)
as to the forms of worship leading to inferior results. It is nowhere
declared that those forms of worship which relate to Non-duality shall
be followed by the *Renunciate only*.

“But, having declared that ‘there are three departments of *Dharma*’,
the Upaniṣad (Chāndogya) names ‘sacrifice, study and charity’, which
represent the duties of the Householder; then it mentions ‘austerity’
which refers to the Hermit; then it speaks of the^(‘)Student dwelling in
the Teacher’s house’, which refers to the Life-long Student; and lastly
it mentions ‘one who is fixed in Brahman’, and this refers to the
Renunciate. Further on, it declares that the former three lead to
‘sacred regions’; from which it follows that it is the remaining fourth,
the Renunciate, who attains Immortality.”

Not so at all; the term ‘*brahmasaṃstha*’, ‘fixed in Brahman’, is used
in its literal sense of ‘one who is given up to meditating upon Brahman’
\[and this has no reference to any particular stage of life\].

“If all men were equally entitled to it, then all that the Upaniṣad need
have said is ‘one who is fixed in Brahman reaches Immortality’ \[and
nothing need have been said regarding the three life-stages\]”.

Not so; what the passage means is that,—‘the several life-stages lead to
sacred regions, which constitutes the result mentioned in connection
with the Injunctions relating to the stages; but if, *while still in the
same stages*, if a man fixes himself upon Brahman, he attains
*Immortality*, which means *non-return to birth*.’

“Those who know the Self have declarered that Brahman is non-dual; and
It is also called ‘one in whom all activity has ceased’; the Life-stages
on the other hand, all constitute the path of activity, consisting of
the performance of various acts leading up to various results; so that
there is a clear incompatibility between the ‘knowing of the *non-dual*
Self’ and the performance of the *Agnihotra* and other rites, which are
inseparable from the stages of the Householder &c., and which are all
based upon notions of *diversity*

Our answer to this is as follows:—This would be equally applicable to
Renunciation also, which also consists of restraints and observances,
which presuppose diversity.

It might be argued that—“For the man who has renounced all activity and
entered the path of Inaction, there are no scriptural injunctions at
all”.

Such certainly is not the meaning of the scriptures. Renunciation is
going to be described as ‘the surrendering of the notions of *I* and
*mine*’, and not the abandoning of all that is enjoined by the
scriptures. Further, in connection with the Renunciate also, when he is
hungry and goes about begging food, the notion of action and agent is
always present. Under the circumstances, what reasonable man could
assert that—“in the case of the Renunciate there is no incompatibility
between his engaging in the said acts pertaining to the ordinary worldly
life and his realising of the non-dual Brahman,—while there is a clear
incompatibility between this latter and the performance of the
*Agnihotra* and other acts prescribed by the scriptures”?

The following argument may here be put forward “When the Renunciate is
hungry and engages himself in eating, there is certainly incompatibility
between this act and his knowledge of Self; but this incompatibility or
incongruity lasts during that time only; just when a man walks in the
dark he may put hist foot upon thorny places; but when the sun rises and
he obtains sufficient light, he places his foot only upon the right
path, which is free from thorns; in the same manner, during the time
that the man is suffering from hunger, he loses sight of his knowledge
of Self; but as soon as the cessation of hunger comes about, like light
in the other case, his firm conviction regarding the Self reasserts
itself and the man regains his knowledge”.

The same may be said regarding the Hermit also.

For the Householder also, there would be nothing incongruous in his
attending to his wife and children and also meditating upon Brahman.

“But how can the man of manifold activities, who has become identified
with *diversity*, ever obtain conviction regarding *Non-duality*”?

In connection with the duties of the Householder also it has been laid
down that—‘he shall meditate in solitude’ (4.248), and ‘having made over
eveything to his son &c.’ (4.247)

“It has been declared in the *Śruti* that ‘the man desiring heaven
should not die before the span of his lift; has run out how then can
there beany ‘giving up of the body’ for the Hermit? It is not possible
for the present text to restrict this *Śruti-* text to cases *other than
that of the Hermit*. Because the *Śruti* is more authoritative, and as
such, could not be restricted in its scope by the *Smṛti*.”

There would be no going against the said *Śruti* if the man were to seek
death when his body is torn up by old age and by sorrows and he knows
that death is near at hand. What the

*Śruti* says is ‘before the span of his life has run out’; where as if
dying were not considered right under nay and every circumstances, then
it would have simply said ‘one desirous of heaven should not die.’
Further, the Upaniṣads speak of several signs of approaching death; and
these also have their use in connection with the *Śruti* in question;
the sense being that ‘unless a man knows of impending death by means of
such signs he shall not seek to die.”—(32)

‘*Āsām anyatamayā*’—‘The aforesaid austerities as also the *Great
Journey*’ (Medhātithi); so also ‘others.’ There is no difference of
opinion among the commentators, as Buhler makes out,

Hopkins is wrong in translating ‘*bhṛguprapāta*’ as ‘drowning;’—Buhler
has understood it rightly to mean ‘precipitating himself from a mount.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.55), winch adds the following
notes:—The ‘*brahmoloka*’ here meant is not ‘the eternal Brahman’, but a
particular *region*; otherwise there would be no sense in the adding of
the term ‘*loka*’; also because Liberation (which would be the ‘reaching
of the eternal Brahman’) is not held to be attained without the fourth
Life-stage of Renunciation; as is clear from the *Śruti* text
(Chāndogya) which speaks of the first three life-stages as
‘*puṇyalokāḥ*’, ‘leading to sacred regions’, and of the
‘*Brahmasaṃstha*’ (Renunciate) alone as attaining immortality.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 5.31);—in
*Aparārka* (p. 945), which adds that the ‘methods’ referred to are those
described under verse 23 *et. seq*. it adds that all that has been
prescribed under the ‘duties of the Religious Student’ has to be
followed by the Householder, the Hermit and the Renunciate also, in so
far as it does not militate against anything that has been prescribed
specifically for any of these.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 398).

Henceforward we have the description of the fourth life-stage.

‘*Third part*.’—*i.e*, having remained, in the forest *for some time*;
for such time as would suffice for the due performance of austerities
and the proper allayment of longing for objects of enjoyment. The phrase
cannot be taken as standing precisely for the exact ‘third part’ of the
man’s life; because the period of the life-stage is not determined
precisely with reference to one hundred years (the alleged span of man’s
life); because the time for entering on the third life-stage has been
indicated as that marked by the appearance of ‘wrinkles and grey hair’;
and in every man these do not always appear at the completion of fifty
years. Then again, elsewhere it has been declared that ‘one should go
forth on the completion of his austerities’.

“In the case of the other life-stages the time has been precisely
indicated—*e.g*. (*a*) Studentship shall continue till the Veda has been
got up, (*b*) the life of the Householder shall continue till the
appearance of wrinkles and grey hairs; in the present instance however
no such time is indicated; whether we take it to be the ‘third part’ as
asserted in the present text, or ‘on the completion of
austerities,’—even so we stand in need of information regarding the
exact time meant; for there is no knowing by what time one’s austerities
might be completed. For these reasons it is necessary that the time
should be indicated by the words of the text”

It has already been explained that the ‘third part of life’ cannot be
determined with reference to ‘a hundred years’; and as regards the exact
time, it has been clearly indicated by such words as—‘one should take to
the life of the Wandering Mendicant after the body has fully ripened’;
which means that ‘one should go forth after he has performed enough
austerities, and till sufficiently advanced age, to be convinced that
there is no more chance of any recrudescence of the passions.’

‘*Having passed*’— having lived through; *i.e*. having carried on the
duties as detailed above.

‘Renouncing of attachment’ consists in not harbouring notions of *I* and
*mine*, in *resting within one’s self*.—(33).

**(verses 6.33-34)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (2.17.1-6).—‘Now we shall explain the rule for entering the
order of Renunciates. Some say that he who has finished his studentship
may become a renunciate immediately after that. But according to others
renunciation is fit only for such *Śālīnas* and *Yāyāvaras* as are
childless, or widowers. In general, they prescribe renunciation after
the completion of the seventieth year and after the children have been
firmly settled in their sacred duties. Or a Hermit may become a
Renunciate on the completion of the special rites prescribed for him.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.17.15-17).—‘It is declared in the Veda that “entering
stage after stage man becomes one with Brahman.” They quote also the
following verse—“Ho who has passed from stage to stage, has offered
burnt oblations and kept his organs under subjection, becomes
afterwards, tired with giving alms and making offerings, a Renunciate.
Such a Renunciate becomes one with the Infinite.’

*Viṣṇu* (96.1).—‘After having passed through the first three stages, and
having annihilated passion, he should offer an oblation to Prajāpati in
which he gives away all his belongings as the sacrificial fee, and enter
the stage of the Renunciate.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.55-56).—‘Passing on from the stage of the Householder
or from that of the Hermit, he shall perform the sacrifice to Prajāpati,
at which he gives away all his belongings as the sacrificial fee, and on
its completion, withdrawing the fires within himself, he shall turn his
mind towards Liberation, after having studied the Veda, performed
*Japa*, begotten sons, made gifts of food, maintained the fires, and
performed sacrifices to the best of his capacity.’

*Jābāla-smṛti* (Aparārka, p. 946).—‘Having completed Studentship, he
shall become a Householder; after having been a Householder, he shall
become a Hermit; after having been a Hermit he shall go forth as a
Renunciate; or he may go forth directly after Studentship or
Householdership or Hermitship.’

*Jābāla* (Parāśaramādhava, p, 535).—‘One should go forth the very day on
which he becomes freed from all attachments.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Aparārka, p. 947).—‘After he has lived in the forest
as a Hermit, the man, calm and advanced in age, should make up his mind
to go forth as a Renunciate. Having withdrawn the fires within himself,
free from all such feelings as fear, avarice, delusion, anger, sorrow,
envy, pride and jealousy, he should not wait for any time; as men’s
determinations are evanescent; hence he shall not wait for *to-morrow*,
*to-morrow*; that very day he shall renounce all activities and go forth
as a Renunciate.’

*Vāyupurāṇa* (Do., p. 949).—‘Leading the life of the Hermit, having his
sins burnt by austerities, the twice-born man shall take to renunciation
and enter the fourth stage. ì laving made offerings to Brāhmaṇas, gods
and his own Pitṛs and men, and having performed the *Vaiśvānarī* or the
*Prājāpatya* sacrifice, he shall deposit the fires within himself and
shall go forth, uttering the proper *mantras*: thenceforward he shall
renounce all affection and longing for sons and others.’

*Nṛsiṃhapurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 951).—‘The Brāhmaṇa, whose gestatory,
generative and digestive organs and the head are well-controlled, may go
forth as a Renunciate, even without having married, and live on alms.
Renunciation consists in the giving up of the affections, attachment to
objects of sense, son, wife, good and evil, as also the anxiety for
worldly affairs.’

*Dakṣa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 533).—‘If any one reverses the order of the
stages, he is the most sinful among men. If one having been a
Householder, becomes a Religious Student, he is neither a Renunciate nor
a Hermit; he is beyond the pale of all the stages.’

*Aṅgiras* (Do., p. 534).—‘Having found the world to be devoid of
essence, and longing for the essential substance, the man, being free
from all attachment, goes forth, without marrying. One may go forth
either directly after Studentship or after having led the life of the
Householder, or after having lived as a Hermit in the forest.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 536).—‘On the death of his wife, if he does not take to
another wife, he should go forth as a Renunciate; or this highest path
may be taken up by one who, having lived as a Hermit, has shaken off all
his sins.’

*Nārada* (Do, p. 537).—‘Even from the very first stage, if the Brāhmaṇa
becomes freed from all attachment for this ocean of worldliness, and
desires liberation, he should renounce relationships and go forth as a
Renunciate.’

*Yogi-Yājñavalkya* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 537).—‘There are four stages
prescribed by the Veda for the Brāhmaṇa, three for the Kṣatriya, two for
the Vaiśya and one for the Śūdra.’

*Vāmanapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘Pour stages have been spoken of for the Brāhmaṇa;
three only, *i.e*., those of the Householder, the Student, the Hermit,
for the Kṣatriva; only two—Householdership and Hermitship—for the
Vaiśya; only one, that of Householdership, is proper for the Śūdra.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.60).—‘Controlling his senses, renouncing all love and
hatred and fear of things, the *twice-born* man becomes immortal.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Aparārka, p. 966; Parāśaramādhava, p. 538).—‘Having paid
off the three debts, being freed from all notions of *I* and *mine*, the
Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, may go forth from the house.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 538).—‘Having deposited the fires
within himself, the *twice-born* man should become a Renunciate.’

This verse lends support to the view that one should pass through all
the life-stages.—‘*Passing from stage to stage*; that is passing from
the Householder’s stage to that of the Hermit.

‘*After offering the sacrifices*’—during both the stages.

‘*With senses subdued*’.—when he becomes so, then alone he should go
forth.

‘*If he dies*, *then he prospers*’—‘*i*. *e*., obtains most excellent
for splendour,

‘*Tired of alms and offerings*’—by having recourse to these along time.

This is reiterative reference to the duties of the Life-stages.—(35).

‘*Paying off*’— Clearing off the debt.

‘*One shall turn his mind towards Liberation*’.—The term ‘liberation’
here indicates the stage of Renunciation; it is this stage that is
spoken of as the principal path which leads to Liberation only; not so
the other stages (which lead to other results also); hence

This *Smṛti-text* reiterates what has been said in the following
*Śruti*—‘Man is born beset with three debts—the debt of sacrifice to the
gods, the debt of offspring to the Pitṛs, and the debt of vedic study to
the sages’ (*Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa*, 1.7.2.1).

“But the Jābāla-śruti has declared that—‘one should go forth as a
mendicant after having been a house-holder, or he may go forth directly
after studentship’."

Our explanation of this is as follows:—What the text just quoted does is
to mention the mere coming into existence of the stage of Renunciation;
and if it were taken in its literal sense it would be contrary to what
is said in the following verse regarding the impropriety of ‘going
forth, without having begotten offspring’.

“Well, when we have the *Śruti* just quoted, what if it be contrary to a
*Smṛti-* text?”

We explain. The necessity of taking to the Householder’s life has been
directly enjoined (with all its details); while all that the text does
in regard to the Renunciate is to enjoin that ‘one shall go forth’; and
nothing is said as to the rites to be performed by the Renunciate, or
the procedure to be adopted in regard to those rites. As regards the
Householder on the other hand, the *Agnihotra* and other rites have been
prescribed along with nil their appurtenant details. This is what we
meant (by urging that the *Śruti* text quoted, if taken in its literal
sense, would be contrary to the *Smṛti-* text). Those persons then who,
not knowing of the *Śruti* text describing the^(‘)three debts’, take
their stand upon *Smṛti* -texts only, and become life-long ‘students’,
find themselves running up against the ‘Householder’s Life’ which has
been directly enjoined.

There are some people who explain the Smṛti-texts relating to the
‘Life-long Student’ as applying to the case of such men as are suffering
from impotence or some such debility, and are, on that account, not
entitled to entering upon the House holder’s Life.

But we do not understand what these people really mean. Their meaning
may be as follows:—Such a person is not entitled to the rites laid down
in the Śruti, on account of their being incapable of properly
accomplishing such acts as *the* *ex* *amining of the clarified butter*
(which cannot be done by the *blind*), or the *walk in Viṣṇu’s steps*
(which cannot be done by the *lame*); and that even so the said
Śruti-texts have their application in the case of such men as are
capable of duly accomplishing the rites with all the said details; so
that there is no need for taking them as forcing the disabled persona
also to perform the acts^(”).

If this is what is meant, then as regards the *Smṛti* -texts also which
speak of the ‘Life-long student’,—such a student also would have to
‘fetch water for the Teacher,’ to beg for food, and so forth; and in
regard to the Renunciate also it has been declared that ‘he shall not
dwell in any one place for a second night’. So that how could the blind
and lame be entitled to these life-stages as prescribed by the *Smṛti*
-texts? In fact the Initiatory Ceremony (*upanayana*) itself is clearly
indicative of all (the four life-stages). Hence the desire of the person
for marriage, which is referred to later on (9.203) in the text—‘if he
has need for a wife etc. &c.’ Though in connection with the Initiatory
Ceremony also, there are several details, such as *looking at the sun,
going round the fire*, and so forth (which cannot be done by the blind
or the lame), yet—in as much as the uninitiated person, by reason of his
having become an outcast, would not be entitled to marry,—it is open to
the man to keep up bis studentship, even though defective, by serving
his Teacher to the best of his ability. As for the impotent man, he is,
by his very nature, unfit for the Initiatory Ceremony; in fact, like the
outcast, he is not entitled to anything at all.

From all this our mind is not satisfied with the view that the life of
the Renunciate (directly after studentship), or that of the Life-long
Student, is meant for disabled people. In fact the two methods may well
be regarded as optional alternatives; as is done in the case of the two
Vedic texts laying down oblations to be offend ‘before sunrise’ and
‘after sunrise’. And it is in accordance. with the alternative view that
nil the four life-stages should be passed through that we have the
passage—‘without paying off his debts &c.’,—which is *deprecatory* and
not *prohibitive* (of Life-long Studentship, or Direct Renunciation).
Or, it may be taken as referring to cases where the married man is going
to take to Renunciation.—(36).

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 3) along with 35 which
has the following notes:—These two verses mean that a man who has not
already acquired dispassion towards worldly and celestial things should
do all things according to the scriptures and then have recourse to
Renunciation,—‘*vrajatyadhaḥ*’ *i.e*., lingers in the *satya* and other
regions lower than Liberation,—the *Jabāla śruti* justifies Renunciation
also for those who have not passed through all the preceding
life-stages.

**(verses 6.36-37)  
**

*Bodhāyana* (2.11.34).—‘Those dwell with us who fulfil the following
duties—the study of the Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of
offspring, faith, austerity, sacrificing and giving gifts; he who
praises other duties becomes dust and perishes.’

*Āpastamba* (2.24.8).—(Same as Baudhāyana.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.57).—‘One shall turn his mind towards liberation only
after having studied the Vedas, performed *japa*, obtained sons, given
away food, maintained the fires and performed sacrifices to the best of
his ability;—never otherwise.’

(For other texts, see under 33-34.)

*Kāmandaka* (2.29-31).—‘The duties of the Renunciate are to renounce all
activity, to live on begging, to dwell under trees, to refuse all gifts,
to avoid injury to living beings, to maintain an attitude of equality
towards all, to be neutral to friends and enemies, to be unmoved by joy
and grief, to be pure in mind and body, to curb speech, observe vows, to
withdraw the senses from their objects, to keep the mind collected, to
be absorbed in meditation and to purify his intentions.’

‘*Prājāpatya Sacrifice*’—as prescribed in the Yajurveda; at this the
giving away of all one’s belongings is enjoined. After this has been
performed, the Fires are reposited by the man within himself; the exact
procedure of this *repositing* also has to be learnt from that same
Veda.

The compound ‘*Sarvavedasadakṣiṇam*’is to be treated as a *Bahuvrīhi*
compound; ‘that at which all one’s belongings are given away as the
sacrificial fee’. ‘*Vedas*’ mean *wealth*; and the whole of this is to
be given away. This is the sense attributed to the ‘an’ affix in the
term ‘*sarvāvedasa*’. Or the ‘*an*’ affix may be taken in the reflexive
sense; the ‘*Prajñādi* group’ (which are laid down as taking the said
affix in this sense) being a purely tentative one.

Others have explained the ‘Prājāpatya sacrifice’ as *human sacrifice*.
At this latter the Brāhmaṇa forms the first animal to be sacrificed in
accordance with the injunction ‘the Brāhmaṇa should be sacrificed to
Brahman’; and ‘Prājāpati’ is only another name f or Brahman; and since a
sacrifice is named after its chief deity, ‘Prājāpatya’ is the name for
the *human* sacrifice. Farther, it is only in connection with this
sacrifice that the scriptures have enjoined the *giving away of all
belongings, the repositing of the Fires within oneself* and *the going
forth as a mendicant*. We have the following *Śruti* -text on this
point:—‘Having reposited the

Fires within himself, and regarding this repositing as a worship
rendered unto Āditya, the man should go forth; then alone does he become
securer than gods and men

Some people have held that the ‘repositing of the Fires within himself’,
which is mentioned in connection with Renunciation, becomes fulfilled if
the Fires are made over to the wife at her death; and hence Renunciation
is to be taken to only in the event of the wife’s death, when a second
wife need not be taken.

But in that case the text bearing on the subject should have been in
some such form as—‘in the event of the wife dying first, the Fires
should be made over to her at her funeral rite’, and since the present
treatise is the work of a human author, and not a Veda, the answer would
not be available that no exception can be taken to its words. (?)—(38).

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.57) to the
effect that the Brāhmaṇa only is entitled to the life of Renunciation.

The verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 538), in the sense
that when going to enter the stage of Renunciation, the man should
perform the Prājāpatya sacrifice in which he should give away all his
belongings as the ‘sacrificial fee’;—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p.
13).

*Bodhāyana* (2.17.21).—‘A Brāhmaṇa who, knowing this, dies after fasting
during the night of Brahman, and depositing within himself the sacred
fires, conquers all guilts, even that of killing a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Viṣṇu* (96.1, 2).—‘After having passed through the first three stages,
and annihilated passion, he must offer an oblation to Prajāpati, in
which he bestows all his wealth as the sacrificial fee, and enter the
stage of the Renunciate. Having reposited the fires in his own mind, he
must enter the village in order to collect alms.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.56).—‘Either after Studentship, or after Hermitship,
having performed the *Prājāpatya* sacrifice, at which his entire wealth
is given away as the sacrificial fee, and at its completion, repositing
the fires within himself,—(he shall turn his mind towards liberation).’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 538).—‘Repositing the fires within
himself, the twice-born should go forth as a Renunciate, devoted to the
practice of *Yoga*. After having performed the *Prājāpatya* or the
*Āgneyī* sacrifice, and having all his impurities evaporated within
himself, he should have recourse to the stage dedicated to Brahman.’

*Nṛsiṃhapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 539).—‘Leading the life of the
Hermit, having his sins burnt by austerity, the twice-born person
should, in accordance with the law, take to renunciation and enter the
fourth stage. Having made offerings to gods, *Pitṛs*, sages and men, and
also to himself, and having performed the *Prājāpatya* or the
*Vaiśvānarī* sacrifice, he shall reposit the fire within himself and,
reciting mantras, go forth.’

*Kātyāyana* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 542).—‘Having reposited the fires
within himself, seated in the centre of the altar, and meditating upon
Hari, having obtained the permission of his *guru*, he should pronounce
the *Praiṣamantra*.’

This verse eulogises the fourth life-stage at the expense of the
Householding stage.

At sacrifices animals are killed; the cutting of herbs and grasses also
constitutes ‘killing’, according to the theory that ‘all that grows is
animate’. It is this that constitutes the ‘fear’ of living beings. So
that when one has gone away from home, and has disposed of the Fires,
there is no such fear from him. This is what is meant by the
words—‘*having granted freedom from fear to all beings*.’ This also
indicates that the Renunciate shall not pick up for his use any inch
leaves or twigs as have not quite dried up.

‘*Of light*’—ever effulgent; where the rising and s etting of the sun
are not perceived; this is what is described by the words of the
Upaniṣads—^(‘)Beyond this the sun does not rise or set’—(39).

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 20), which explains
‘*brahmavedinaḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*brahmavādinaḥ*’) as
‘knowing the Brahman with properties’, which is clear from its being
mentioned along with ‘effulgent regions’ which could have no connection
with one who knows the absolute Brahman.

It is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 460).

This verse enjoins solitude.

‘*Alone*’—denotes the giving up of past acquaintances.

‘*Without a companion*’:—he shall not take with him even his former
servant &c. It is only in this way that the man becomes free from
friendship, hatred and love; and thus comes to look upon all things as
equal. Otherwise, if a servant happen to be near him, he could have the
notion that—‘this man is *mine*, not that’; and this is the attachment
that becomes the cause of bondage.

When he realises this, then he does not ‘*forsake*’—no son or anybody
else is ever forsaken, by him; and hence he himself also is not
‘*forsaken*’—*not* separated from this son and others; *i.e*., he is not
beset with the pain of separation from them. Otherwise—if there had been
attachment—the giving up would cause great pain. In fact, for auch a man
no one dies, nor does he die for any one.—(42).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 953), which explains ‘*siddhim na
jahāti*’ as ‘he is not abandoned by success’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 557), which adds the following explanation:—Coming to the
conclusion that when a man moves about alone, without a companion, he is
free from any such obstacles as attachment aversion and the like, and
thus becomes enabled to attain ‘success’ in the shape of True
Knowledge;—*i.e*., he acts without shackles towards its attainment; and
of that success lie is not deprived, *i.e*., he attains it. If, on the
other hand, he moves about with two or three companions, then he becomes
liable to attachment and aversion, and by reason of these obstacles, he
fails to attain that success.

The abandoning of the *Śrauta* fires has been mentioned before; this
verse speaks of the abandoning of the *domestic* fire. Or tins may be
taken as forbidding the act of cooking, and of seeking for fuel for the
fire required for the allaying of cold and such other purposes.

‘*Niketa*’ is home.

‘*He may go*’—for one night—‘*to* *a village for food*’; and having got
what he needs, he should spend the rest of his time in the forest. This
living in the village for a single night has been declared by Gautama.
If the man happen to be near a village, then he shall enter it only for
obtaining food; but if he happens to be far off from it, then he may
dwell there for a single night, and pass on to the forest for the
second.

‘*Disinterested*’;—he should not own his even such inanimate objects as
the water-pot and the like. Or, it may mean that he shall not have
recourse to any remedy for his bodily ailments.

Some people read ‘*asaṅkusukaḥ*’;—‘*saṅkusuka*’ means fickle, unsteady;
and the opposite of this denotes firmness of mind.

‘*Silent*’—with the organ of speech under his full control

‘*Calmly disposed*’— Calm in disposition; *i.e*., he shall give up all
mental imaginings; he shall be calm by *disposition* not in mere speech
(43).

This denotes freedom from troubles.

He shall not seek death; nor shall he seek life, for the purpose of
acquiring more knowledge.

‘*He shall await his time*’.—He shall cultivate the habit of thinking
‘let anything happen at any time it may’.

‘*Just as the servant waits for the fulfilness of his contract*’—‘This
work I have got to do for him during the day,—if I stop in the middle, I
shall not obtain full wages’.

Worldliness having thus ceased, when the man’s body falls off, he
attains Liberation, by this process and not by doing whatever he
likes.—(45)

Having looked over the path with the eye, he should place his foot on a
spot where there may be no animals to suffer from his tread.

It being already known that one should tell the truth, the term
‘*pūta*’, ‘*sanctified*’, is meant to show that the term ‘*satya*’,
‘*truth*’, is purely indicative; hence there is nothing incongruous in
this.

One shall always remain *pure in his mind*; *i.e*. he shall not even

When one speaks in a manner contrary to the scriptures, his words are
called ‘*improper*’—*i.e*. hard, disagreeable taunts;—these he shall
‘*bear patiently*’—*i.e*. tolerate, not answer back. In fact, he shall
not bear ill-will even in his mind; what is implied by the direction is
that ‘on being cursed he shall pronounce a blessing,” which forbids even
mental perturbation; and it does not mean that he shall actually ask the
man—‘is it well with you?’ Because if he spoke thus (and bore anger in
his mind) he would be a liar, saying one thing and thinking of another.

‘*He* *shall* *not* *insult*’—shall not show disrespect towards—any one.
That is, he shall not omit to show respect to his elders.

‘*For the sake of his present body*;’—*i.e*. if some one were to strike
his body—‘he shall not make enmity with him.’ He is to think all the
time in the following strain—? what would it matter whether this body
perished or not, I may have an effulgent body.’—(47).

‘*Seven openings*’—(1) Duty and wealth, (2) duty and pleasure, (3)
wealth and pleasure, (4) pleasure and wealth, (5) pleasure and duty, (6)
wealth and duty, and (7) wealth—pleasure—duty. He shall not utter an
untrue word spreading over all these. All these are based upon notions
of *diversity*; and all diversity is untrue; hence the word relating to
these is called ‘untrue’.

The sense is that the man shall speak only such words as pertain to
Liberation.

Or, the ‘*seven openings*’ may stand for the seven breaths in the head;
and these are the ‘openings’ of speech. Or, it may stand for the six
sense-organs and Intellect as the seventh. It is only when objects have
been perceived by means of these that words speak of them. Others
explain that the ‘*seven openings*’ stand for the seven declensional
terminations.—(48).

What is laid down here is that the man shall *eat once*, this being the
purpose of the alms; it does not mean that he shall go to beg only once.
What is intended here is the prohibition of eating twice; that is, the
man, having gone for alms once, shall not save out of it for eating
again. It is with a view to this that we have the prohibition *of
eating*. It is for this reason that the text adds ‘*he shall not seek
for a large quantity*;’ *Seeking for a large quantity* can only be for
the purpose of eating again and again; specially because for one who
delights in solitude, large quantities of food would not be wanted for
the sake of servants and other dependents. By supplying a reason for
what is laid down, the text implies that even at a single meal the man
shall not eat too much.—(55)

That time at which people have already eaten. Similarly with the other
epithets, ‘*Vidhūme*’ and the rest.

‘*Removal of the dishes*,’—the throwing away of the dishes in which
people have taken their food; when this has been finished.

From all this what follows is that he shall beg for food after the first
occasion for the giving of alms, during the first instalment of the
cooking, has passed away.

‘*When there ie no smoke*’ etc., indicate the impossibility of the
cooking being done again.

When the pestles have ‘*ceased to ply*’—*i.e*., kept aside.—(56)

If at the stated time he should fail to obtain food, he shall not be
‘*sorry*,’ dejected in mind. He shall not allow grief or joy to overtake
him at failing or succeeding to obtain food.

‘*What suffices to sustain his life*.’—This indicates the quantity of
food to be begged. What this implies is that in the event of his failing
to obtain alms, he shall sustain his life by such fruits, roots and
water as do not belong to another person.

‘*Accessories*’— vessels, staff and so forth;—‘*attachment to
these*’—*i*. *e*., making special efforts to obtain them;—from this he
should he ‘*free*’; that is he shall harbour no longings.—(57)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 963), which explains ‘*mātrā*’

p. 563), which explains ‘*mātrā*’ etymologically as ‘*mīyante iti*’, as
meaning ‘objects’; since he is free from attachment to all objects,
therefore he should be neither glad at getting them nor sorry at not
getting them.

*Baudhāyana* (2.18.13).—‘The following arc the vows for the
Renunciate:—Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness,
abstention from appropriating the property of others, continence and
liberality. There are five minor vows:—*viz*., abstention from anger,
obedience to the Teacher, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness and purity
in eating.’

renounced love and hate, and having abandoned fear, the Brāhmaṇa becomes

become abandoned, then the mortal becomes immortal and even in this

What is stated here is a mode of meditating upon the Supreme Truth,
consisting in the noting of the fact that birth and rebirth abound in
pain.

Finding that life in the world abounds in sufferings caused by the
separation from friends, relations, sons and wife and the loss of wealth
&c., how could the man voluntarily go on undergoing the physical
troubles of wandering about, begging for alms and so forth?

The ‘*conditions*’ of men abound in pain and result from the defects of
their actions,—from their doing what is forbidden; *e.g*., such acts as
doing injury to living beings, stealing, adultery, cruelty, back-biting,
improper intentions and so forth. Or ‘conditions’ may stand for what the
man undergoes in the world of the living itself,—in the shape of sorrows
resulting from poverty, disease, ill-treatment and so forth.

As regards the other world, there is ‘*falling into hell*’—*i.e*., being
born as worms and insects in places filled with urine, ordure and dirt
&c.

‘*Sufferings in the abode of the death-god*’—in the form of *Kumbhīpāka*
and other hells.

Something more has to be reflected upon (and this is pointed out in the
next verse).—(61)

youth from not obtaining the objects of pleasure, and upon the abode in
hells awarded as punishment for enjoying them after they have been
obtained unlawfully; and on the fearful agonies of hell.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.63, 64).—‘He should reflect upon residence in the womb,

physical ailments and other troubles, decrepitude, bodily deformities,

The Accusative ending is due to the verse being construed along with the
verb ‘should reflect’ (of the preceding verse.)

‘*Loved ones*’—sons and other relations.

‘*Separation*’—caused by their untimely death.

‘*Hated persons*’—Enemies.

‘*Meeting*’—in battle &c.

‘*Decrepitude*.’—‘Decrepitude’ is a peculiar state of the body during
the fourth quarter of man’s age.—‘*Being beset* having the shape of the
body spoilt, feebleness, weakness of the senses, the advent of asthma
and other diseases, being loved by none, being jeered at by all;—all
this constitutes being ‘beset with decrepitude.’

‘*Diseases*’— even before the advent of old age, some people are
attacked by diseases.—(62)

There is ‘*departure*’—going out—of the life-breaths; and this
constitutes unbearable pain.

‘*Birth in the womb*’— where there are several kinds of pain: the organs
are not *yet* developed, the child in the womb is in utter darkness, and
it also suffers from diseases, described in the medical science, as
proceeding from the extremely cold and hot foods eaten by the mother in
varying quantities.

‘*Transmigrations*’— passing through—‘*among millions of
life-forms*’;—the soul being born in the bodies of lower animals, worms,
insects, dogs and so forth.

*Objection*—“The Inner Soul is held to be omnipresent and eternal; how
can there be any ‘*departure*’ for it, when it is present everywhere?
how again can there be any ‘*transmigration*’ among life-forms? how too
can there be any ‘*birth*’ for it when it is eternal?”

*Our answer is as follows*:—The theory of some people is that there lies
within the body the ‘personality’ of the size of the thumb, composed of
rudimentary substances, mind and intellect; and it is this personality
that goes on being born during the entire series of births and deaths;
and when this becomes endowed with a certain merit, the faculty of
consciousness becomes manifested in it; and it is through this faculty
that the qualities of the said Personality come to be attributed to the
Inner Soul.

Or, the explanation may be that the inner soul is related to certain
entities in the shape of the life-breath and so forth; and when these
depart, the soul is said to ‘depart.’ Similarly with ‘birth.’

All this we shall explain again under Discourse XII and we need not
prolong the discussion here.—(63)

The ‘*infliction*’—experiencing—‘*of* *pain*’ proceeds from Demerit.

‘*Merit*’—as described above, is an ‘*artha*’, an ‘*entity*’ and from
this—entity, essence—proceeds ‘*union with imperishable happiness*’.

This also has to be reflected upon.

The meaning is that Renunciation constitutes the principal merit.—(64)

‘*Meditation*’—steadiness of the functioning of the mind, as described
by Patañjali. By means of that, ‘*he shall recognise the subtile
character*’ of the conscious entity in the body, the soul; and he shall
not look upon either the body etc. or the life-breath etc, as the
‘Soul,’ which latter is to be understood, by the help of intuition born
of meditation, as something different from all external and internal
things;—this is what is meant by the text. Of the Soul, there are no
grosser manifestations. And just as he can realise the ‘possibility of
its presence’—in the higher organisms in the form of the bodies of the
Gods and other such beings—*i.e*., the fact of its ensouling these
bodies and pasting through experiences born therein, even though in
reality it is omnipresent,—exactly in the same manner can one realise it
also in the lower organisms, of lower animals, spirits, demons and so
forth.

According to the philosophy of Monism, the souls in the organisms are
only so many manifestations of the Supreme Self; and it is for this
reason that the text has spoken of the man recognising the ‘*t*
*ransmigrations* of the Higher Self.’—(65)

‘*Adorned*’—with flowers, bracelets and other ornaments.

‘*Duty*’—all that has been prescribed for the Renunciate, such as
meditation on the Self and so forth, he shall perform with care. In fact
one should perform the duties of that order to which he may belong.

One should not consider himself to have become a ‘Renunciate’ merely by
wearing such external marks as the ‘three staffs’ and the like; in fact
‘*he should be equal, to all beings*’;—that is, he should, with care,
eschew all love, hatred and greed.

By deprecating the external marks it is not meant that the man should
wear ornaments.—(66)

When the fruit of the *kataka* tree is put in dirty water, the water
becomes clarified, takes the clear form. But it does not become clear by
the mere mention of the name of that fruit; it needs *action*.
Similarly, the wearing of external marks is like the pronouncing of the
name of the fruit; and success is attained, not by that wearing alone,
but by the due fulfilment of such duties as ‘resting in solitude’,
‘meditation’, ‘equal-mindedness towards all beings’ and so forth.

This verse shows the necessity for what has been said above (46)
regarding the treading on the ground ‘sight-purified.’

‘*Even* *during bodily illness*’—when the body is suffering from some
disease;—‘*during day and night*’— when the grass-bed has been spread
for sleeping, he shall not lay down his body upon it without having
carefully looked over it. The transgression of this rule involves the
necessity of performing an expiatory rite.

Or, the text may be taken as referring to those minute animalcules that
become attached to the man’s body and perish by the mere moving of the
limbs.—(68)

Renunciate only.

‘*Even three*’—more than three lead to more excellent results; *three*
are absolutely necessary.

‘*Vyāhṛti syllables*’— those mentioned under 2.81.

‘*Praṇava*’—the syllable ‘om’.

The breath-suspensions are to be ‘*accompanied by these*’.—This
indicates the duration of the breath-suspension.

These breath-suspensions are of three kinds, named ‘*Kumbhaka*’ (total
suspension), ‘*Pūraka*’ (inhaling) and ‘*Recaka*’ (exhaling). The total
suppression of air passing out of the mouth and the nostrils constitutes
the (inhalation and suspension); and when the man does not inhale breath
but continuously keeps on exhaling, it is called ‘Recaka exhalation.’
The exact duration of each of these has been described under Discourse
II. Or, in view of its being spoken of as ‘austerity,’ it may be
continued till it becomes actually painful.—(70)

When the ‘metallic ores,’ of gold for instance, are blasted in a
furnace, what is left behind is pure gold; similarly when the senses
apprehend their objects, the man feels joys and sorrows, and these are
productive of sin; this sin is consumed through the suspension of
breath.

For the man seeking Liberation, indulging in joys and griefs has been
forbidden.

But even in a man who has given up all attachment, and has his organs
under his control, these are bound to appear, in howsoever small a
degree, through the sheer nature of things, whenever by chance various
kinds of colour, sound &c. become presented before him. And it is for
the removal of the taints due to these that breath-suspensions have to
be practised.—(71)

What is said here regarding Breath-suspension has already been indicated
in the preceding verse.

But some people explain this verse to mean that ‘one shall destroy the
*taints*’—*i*.*e*., *love*, *hatred* &c.

But how can these latter be destroyed by means of Breath-suspension?
What can be destroyed by it is *sin* (not *love* &c.), specially as it
is sin only which has its *origin* as well as *destruction* both
indicated in the scriptures, and hence imperceptible; while Love or
Hatred and the rest are all directly perceptible; so that what destroys
these, and what is destroyed by them, can also be learnt by perception,
and not through the scriptures. If the scripture were to speak of the
destroying of these, its meaning would be that ‘one should destroy these
things, which are by their very nature, destructible’;—and what would be
the authority attached to such a declaration? From all this it is clear
that what is meant by the term ‘taint’ is the *evil deed* that proceeds
from Love and the rest. And this is ‘destroyed’ by the destruction of
its effects; because as for the act itself, it perishes by reason of its
evanescent character. This is what is meant by ‘*dāha*’, ‘being
consumed’, and not being actually *burnt to ashes*.

Thus the present verse is only a reiteration of what has gone before in
the preceding verse.

‘*By means of Concentration*’—

*Objection*—“‘*Kilviṣa* (*Kilbiṣa*)’ is *sin*, so is ‘*doṣa*’ also.
Hence the words of the text should have been ‘by means of
Breath-Suspension and Concentration he shall destroy all *taints*,
*doṣas*’; and there would be no need of mentioning *kilviṣa*, sin,
separately. Or, only ‘*kilviṣa*’, sin,’ need have been mentioned, and
where was the need for mentioning ‘*doṣa*,’ ‘*taint*’, also?”

The explanation is as follows:—It is absolutely necessary to mention the
‘taint’, in order to show that what are destroyed by means of
Breath-suspension are only particular kinds of sin, not all. The term
‘taint’ stands for Love and other like things; and hence the word can be
rightly taken as figuratively indicating such *sinful acts* as are
prompted by Love, Hatred &c., as has been already pointed out.

“If so, then, let the *taint* be mentioned, what is the use of
mentioning the ‘*kilviṣa*,’ sin?”

No objection can be taken to it, as it is mentioned only for the purpose
of filling up the metre. Further (the use of the second term gives the
further meaning that) Breath-suspension is destructive of the sin
accruing from the taints of Love &c., while Concentration stops the sin
from arising at all.

“What is ‘Concentration’?”

By a longing for sensual objects and their enjoyment the mind is
sometimes drawn away from the point where it may have been resting
during the periods of quiescence, self-control and the like; and it is
by means of ‘Concentration’ that it is concentrated, kept fixed on that
same point. As a matter of fact, when one perceives brightness, charm,
youth, shapeliness of the body and so forth in a woman, they give rise
to his longing for her; all these details are apprehended by concrete
perception; and all such perceptions are so many thoughts. Hence they
can be counter-acted by counter-thoughts pertaining to the defects in
the object perceived,—such as ‘her body is filled with urine and
ordure,’ ‘the very object Woman consists of skin and bones;—fie upon the
men that long for such a despicable object;—even the slight pleasure
that she affords is momentary, and ultimately leads to terrible
sufferings at the hands of the Death-god’. This is what is called
‘reflecting over’ the object. This reflection of the defects is what is
spoken of below under verse 76.

The same method of reflection is to be employed regarding food and other
objects of enjoyment. For instance—‘all this—sugar, cakes, fresh butter,
milk-rice and so forth—stands on the same footing as coarse food
obtained in alms; there being no difference in their nutritive power;
the slight difference in their taste that may be felt on the tip of the
tongue, is felt for the infinitesimal part of a second, so that even
this momentary taste is like the imaginary city. Similarly one may
reflect upon the defects in the objects of touch; and so forth. This is
what is taught io the present text (by the term ‘Concentration’).

Others offer the following explanation of the term ‘*dhāraṇā*’ of the
text:—When a man by constant practice succeeds in concentrating his
breath, moving along his mouth and nose, in the cavity of his
heart,—this is what constitutes ‘Concentration’.

“In what way would this differ from Breath-suspension?”

The difference is that we have ‘concentration’ also when the breath is
held up in such places as the arms, the forehead and the like; whereas
in Breath-suspension there is always exhalation at the end.

Others again hold ‘*Dhāraṇā*’ Concentration to consist in the qualities
of ‘Friendliness, Joyfulness, Pathos and Indifference.’ ‘Friendliness,
Kindness, Joyousness and Indifference, towards all living beings, carry
the contemplation to the regions of Brahman; and these constitute
*Dhāraṇā*’. (says an old text.)—Here ‘friendliness’ stands for *absence
of hatred*, and not *friendly affection*; as this latter would be of the
nature of a hindrance;—‘kindness’ is pity, a disposition of the mind; it
consists in the longing to rescue a suffering person from suffering, and
not the actual desisting from injuring, or conferring a benefit upon,
others; it is in view of this that it has been described as a
*disposition of the mind*, which should be practised—‘joyousness’ also
stands for *absence of grief* at suffering caused by disease, or at the
fear of the sufferings of hell, and not for actual *pleasure*, as this
would be conducive to attachment;—‘indifference’ towards objects,
favourable as well as unfavourable, is well known.

Or again, ‘concentration’ may be explained as consisting in fixing the
mind on the inner cavity of the heart, in the process of meditating upon
Brahman.

‘*By Abstraction, all attachment*:—‘attachment’ here stands (or the
connection of the senses with their objects and their being drawn
towards them. This is destroyed by Abstraction; whereupon the senses
become drawn off from the objects, or their attraction is obstructed.
For instance, when one happens to see a bracelet or some such ornament,
or a handsome woman, he shall not fix his eyes upon them, he shall move
his eyes to something else; similarly with all the senses. In this
manner the composure of the Yogin becomes unperturbed.

‘*By means of Contemplation, those attributes that are not
independent*.’ The ‘attributes’ meant here are those of Harmony, Energy
and Inertia; and these are ‘*not independent*,’ being subservient to
something else, in the shape of Consciousness. Though the soul or person
is free from pleasure &c., yet there appears in him the false notion ‘I
am happy—I am unhappy’; though he is free from attributes, he identifies
himself with them;—all this has got to be destroyed by contemplating
upon the distinction between the Soul and the Attributes; that the
distinction between the two has to be drawn in some such form as—‘the
Person, being of the nature of Consciousness is beyond Attributes, and
it is Primordial matter that consists of the Attributes.’—(72)

*Inner soul*—the inner controlling personality
‘*presence*’—character—should be recognised.

Notions of pleasure and pain appear not only among human beings but
among all kinds of ‘*beings*, *high and low*’—*i.e*., among animals,
goblins, Piśācas &c.—there is the notion of ‘I’ and ‘mine’; and this has
to be got rid of.

Or, the man may go on pondering over the following ideas—‘This soul is
omnipresent, higher than the sky, higher than heaven, higher than all
these regions, having all happiness, all tastes, all odours, all
touches; and yet he is beset with hunger and thirst; and in the midst of
such pleasures and pains, he passes through the experiences of his
physical body, known as the *I*; how wonderful is the power of actions,
that even this all-pervading, all-embracing soul is made subservient to
the actions! I shall never have recourse to these acts, which are like a
wicked master. Like a hired servant I shall wait upon the acts (already
done by me); as when a man enters a man’s service being urged to it by
his need, thinking him to be kind, but soon finding out that he is
difficult to please, irascible, given to beating, and harsh of speech,
the man decides that he would not serve him any longer, after he has
cleared off by service all that may have been advanced to him.’ The
thought to be practised should be in the form—‘I shall get to the end of
my past acts by going through the experiences resulting from them, and
shall perform no further acts’, and so forth. Similarly one should study
the Vedānta, and having, with its help, discussed the question as to
whether the embodied soul? are only manifestations of the Supreme Self
or independent entities, and come to the conclusion that there is no
soul apart from the Supreme Self,—he should ponder over this.

Others explain the text as follows:—‘*Dhyāna*’ is *Contemplation*, and
‘*Yoga*’ is *Meditation*; and by means of these ‘*he should recognise
the presence of the Inner Soul*’; and having recognised it, he should
meditate upon it.

Or ‘*Dhyāna-yoga*’ may be explained as ‘*yoga*’, *calmness* *of* *mind*,
for the purposes of^(‘)*dhyāna*,’ *contemplation*;—having secured this
calmness,^(‘)*he should recognise the presence* *of* *the Inner Soul*’;
*i.e*., by means of devout worship he shall realise its presence as
equipped with the qualities of Immortality and the like, free from
defects, as described in the Vedānta-texts.

‘*Akṛtātman*’ ‘*unregenerate person*’ is one whose ‘*ātman*’, soul,
mind, is^(‘)*akṛta*,’ untutored. By such persons the Inner Soul cannot
be grasped.—(73)

This describes the result of what has been just enjoined.

‘*True insight*’—true knowledge of the Self, just described;
‘*equipped*’ with this,—*i.e*., having obtained direct apprehension of
it.

‘*Is not fettered by acts*’— does not fall into the cycle of births and
deaths; since the past acts have become exhausted on account of their
effects having been already experienced, and no fresh acts are done.

This does not mean that Liberation is attained by mere knowledge.

He who is not endowed with the spiritual insight, taught in the Vedānta,
and who is only given to the performance of acts, falls into the cycle
of births and deaths.—(74)

These two verses are indicative of the doctrine that Liberation is
attained by Knowledge and Action combined. The preceding verse spoke of
*Knowledge* and the present one speaks of *Action*.

*Question*:—“What are those acts ‘prescribed in the Veda,’ whose result
is here spoken of as the ‘attaining of the position of That Being’? As
for the voluntary acts, the results of these are already mentioned in
those very texts that enjoin the acts themselves; and if they were to
assume results other than those, there would be carrying the matter to
an absurd length; and it would give rise to the great evil that the
results of the acts would become mixed up and confused. Further, since
the injunctive text would have all its syntactical needs supplied by the
mention of the single result, how could any connection be established
between that text and the additional words that would have to be thrown
in if we were to connect the acts with the further result of ‘attaining
the position of That Being’? As a matter of fact, the needs of the
injunction having been supplied by what is directly mentioned in the
text, it does not stand in need of anything else.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—In fact in the Esoteric Section
(of the Veda) we have a distinct text to the effect that ‘one attains
That by means of sacrifice.’ So that by a proper adjustment there would
be both kinds of results accomplished by means of Action; and there
would be nothing incongruous in all the voluntary acts leading to the
more limited results, as also to the attainment of ‘the position of That
Being’; as two distinct sacrifices performed at two different times
would lead to two distinct results The present text moreover has not
specified any particular sacrifice, which could justify the conclusion
that th.e result here spoken proceeds from the *obligatory* acts, and
not from the voluntary ones.

The following argument might be raised against us:—“In as much as no
results have been spoken of in the Vedic texts regarding any results
following from the obligatory acts, it is only right that what is
mentioned in the present text should be connected with those acts, and
not with the voluntary ones; because there would be no difficulty in
connecting it with them; and what the Esoteric text just quoted has
declared regarding ‘*sacrifice*’ leading to That would also be amply
justified by this construction.”

Why should any importance be attached to the mention of results in Vedic
texts? Vedic Texts are purely injunctive in their character; their
function lies in laying down *what should be done*; and that a certain
act *should be done* is made known to us by such terms as ‘as long as
one lives’ and the like, without the help of any words speaking of
results; so that (even when the result is actually mentioned) the word
expressive of the result is not needed at all by the sentence; so that
in cases where it is assumed (and not directly mentioned) it would be
entirely superfluous, and hence could not be construed along with the
injunctive text. Thus then, the conclusion is that the esoteric text
quoted above speaking of ‘sacrifices’ not being capable of being
restricted to any particular kind of sacrifice, must be taken as
including all kinds of sacrifices, obligatory as well as voluntary.

Further, the result spoken of in the present text cannot proceed from
the voluntary acts; as none of then has been enjoined as to be done by
‘one desirous of Liberation’. In fact it was with reference to this that
the text declared (under 2.2) that ‘being given up to desires is not
commendable’; and also in the *Mahābhārata*—‘May thy acts not be done
simply with a view to results. May thou not be addicted to inaction,”
(*Bhagavadgītā* 2.47).

The conclusion thus is that so long as the actor has his mind beset with
notions of diversity, is under the influence of Desire and Ignorance,
and is not free from the notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’,—the results obtained
by him are just the narrow ones that he had bargained for (on the
strength of the Vedic texts); while the other kind of actor, who
undertakes an act without reference to any results, and simply because
it has been enjoined by the Veda and as such *should be done*, attains
*Brahman* Itself, which consists of the highest boundless bliss.

It will not be right to urge against this the following argument:—“There
are one hundred and seventy-one sacrifices; in as much as it would be
impossible for anyone to perform all these, the text would be enjoining
an impossibility (if it meant *all kinds of sacrifices*)”.—Because in
the present context the performance of the acts is meant to be
accomplished by the attainment of *true insight* itself. The meaning is
that all sacrifices are to be accomplished by the said *insight*. This
is what is meant by such texts as—‘Other Brāhmaṇas offer sacrifices by
means of Knowledge itself’.

Or, the particular position or region spoken of in the present text as
attained (by non-injury &c.) may be taken to be just those whose special
character would be determined by the man’s desires—according as he may
be desirous of heaven or sons &c. &c. In fact persons who have their
minds still beset with notions of such diversity as those of ‘past’,
‘present’ and so forth, are prompted by false longings, even when
betaking themselves to acts leading up to the highest ends of man; just
as when a child is tempted to drink a nutritious medicine by the false
hope (set up before it) in the form that by drinking it it would have
long hair.

Another theory on this subject is as follows:—The acts referred to in
the present text are the obligatory ones. It is these whose omission is
sinful, and acts as an obstacle to liberation. And it is the fact of
these being properly performed, the obstacle being thereby removed, that
is spoken of by the expression ‘*by the acts prescribed in the
Veda*’:—even though these have not been enjoined as leading to
liberation.

‘*Rigorous*’—powerfully conducive to the emaciation of the body.

‘*Of that Being*’—of Brahman.

‘*Position*’—place, region.

‘*Attain*’—Acquire.

Or, the ‘*position of that*’ may mean that character of Brahman which
may be in accordance with his desire; *i.e*., being the Lord of all
beings, or self-sufficiency, or the attaining of its very essence, and
so forth.—(75).

**(verse 6.76)**

This is meant to create disgust.

To say nothing of the bodies of worms insects and fleas, which are born
in the earth and out of moisture etc.,—the human body itself, which has
been considered highly desirable, the likelihood of losing which keeps
man in constant fear,—is like a latrine, the abode of urine and ordure.
It is this latrine-hut that is described.

The *bones* constitute the pillars; the hut is supported by the
bones;—it is tied up with the tendons; it is plastered outside with
flesh and blood;—and it is covered up with the *skin*; or *roofed over*
with the skin;—‘*filled with urine and ordure*’;—the use of the Genitive
here is analogous to that in the expression ‘*odanasya pūrṇaḥ*’, filled
with rice.—(76).

**(verse 6.77)**

^(‘)*Wrinkles*’—indicates a peculiar state of the body in old age, due
to its decrepitude.

‘*Harassed*’—ever beset with diseases.

‘*Sullied with passions*’—*i.e*., harbouring desires, the non-fulfilment
of which brings irremediable unbearable pain.

Realising all this the man ‘*shall discard*’ this body, which is the
abode of ‘*material substances*’—the products of the Earth, in the form
of fat, marrow, phlegm, urine, semen and blood;—it cannot be the abode
of the *Soul*; because this is all-pervading. For all these reasons one
should not cherish any affection for the body.—(77.)

*Viṣṇu* (96.43-55).—‘He must recognise this human frame to consist of
seven elements;—those elements are adeps, blood, flesh, flesh-serum,
bone, marrow and semen. It is covered with skin; and it has a nasty
smell; it is the receptacle of impure substances. Though surrounded by a
hundred pleasures, it is subject to change; though carefully supported,
it is subject to destruction. It is the stay of carnal desire, wrath,
greed, folly, pride and selfishness. It consists of earth, water, fire,
air and *ākāśa*. It is provided with bone, tubular vessels, arteries and
sinews. It is endowed with the quality of *Rajas*. It is covered with
six skin-layers; it is kept together by three hundred and sixty hones.’

*Kāmandaka* (3.10).—‘This clayey tenement rendered agreeable by
artificial means is evanescent like a shadow and vanishes even as a

Continuing the figure of the body spoken of as the hut, we have the
simile—‘*as the bird leaves the tree*’. What is meant is, not that the
body should be voluntarily given up, by entering into the fire, or such
methods of suicide, but one shall not cultivate attachment to it. And
then the body shall fall off by itself, by the exhaustion of Karmic
residuum; just as the tree on the banks falls off. This is what has been
said above (40) in regard *not rejoicing at death*.

But when the man has acquired the inner light, has controlled the
movements of his breath, and has withdrawn his mind from all
manifestations of illusion;—he may even voluntarily leave off the body;
in the same manner as the bird leaves the tree.

‘*Shark*’—which is like the shark, resembling it in being a source of
trouble; hence the text has added the term ‘*misery*’; Even for the man
who has attained discriminative wisdom, troubles continue to beset him
so long as the body lasts; as such is the very nature of it.

This second alternative (of leaving the body voluntarily has been put
forward in view of there being objections against the former one (of
awaiting the chance of the falling off of the body I—(78)

Disturbance of the mind caused by pleasure and pain, and appearing in
the forms of joy and sorrow, should be got rid of in the following
manner. \[He shall cultivate the following idea\]—‘When such and such a
person does anything pleasing to me, it is the result of some good act
that I may have done in the past; and the doer of the act has not done
it. through any feelings of affection towards me; in fact he could not
do anything inimical to me; and when some one does what is disagreeable
to me, there also what is the source of my pain is only my own evil act
this is what he shall ponder over while practising meditation; so that
he does not feel any attraction towards the man who does what is
agreeable to him, nor any repulsion towards one who does what is
disagreeable to him.

By doing thus ‘*he reaches the eternal Brahman*’, directly, and has not
got to pass through the intervening stages of the Luminous Path and so
forth.

The presence of the epithet ‘*eternal*’ implies that the man does not
return to the cycle of births and deaths.—(79)

This teaches the cultivation of a mental disposition.

It is not by the abandoning of the acquisition of desired things that
one becomes ‘free from longings’; he becomes so only when he renounces
what forms the source of all longing.

‘*Disposition*’ is an attribute of the mind, or of the soul, in the form
of *desire*..

‘*Towards all things’—‘sarvabhāveṣu*.’— This second ‘*bhūva*’ denotes
*things*. The presence of the epithet ‘*all*’ implies that *attachment*
to even such necessary things as articles of food and drink which are
required for the maintenance of the body, is to be deprecated and not
the *desire*. Because the *desire* for such things, in the form of
hunger and thirst, arises from the very nature of things and is bound to
appear. But ‘desire’ is something different from ‘longing’: *Longing*
arises from attachment and is demeaning; while *desire* for food & c.
appears in the man naturally, after the digestion of what has been eaten
and drunk.—(80)

‘*Having renounced all attachments*.’—‘*Attachment*’ stands for the
notion of ‘mine’ that people have with regard to such things as the cow,
the horse, the elephant, gold, slaves, wife, agricultural lands, houses
and so forth. When this has been renounced, and the man has begun to
delight in solitude;—having taken to this as the principal method, and
in the manner detailed above—*i.e*., by the due performance of the
temporal and spiritual acts prescribed—he ‘*reposes in Brahman*,’—which
is of the nature of pure consciousness; and he is no longer fettered by
actions. This is what is meant by the phrase ‘*from ail pairs of
opposites*’—*i.e*., pleasures and pains as resulting from good and bad
acts.—‘*he* *becomes freed*’—(81)

‘*Appurtenant to Meditation*’,—*i.e*., what comes about only when there
is Meditation; what is attained only when meditation is properly done.

“*All this that has been declared here*’—directly described, not merely
indirectly implied. That is, the cultivating of the feeling that good
and bad deeds are the causes of agreeable and disagreeable
experiences;—when man does something disagreeable, it is always the
outcome of natural fortes of one’s own acts) and stands on the same
footing as when fever causes suffering or fire burns; and just as the
man, who has been burnt by fire, does not hate fire, so also he should
not hate the man that causes him pain; nor shall he forbid him to do it
(just as no one goes to forbid the fire).

All this becomes possible only when there is meditation, when the mind
is duly concentrated. Consequently one should at all times, cultivate
the following thought;—Pleasure and pain are the effect of past Actions;
in reality the King is not the bestower of happiness, of landed property
and other things; in fact it is by my own effort that the first approach
to him was obtained; it is my own past meritorious act that is the real
bestower of the gift, and not the King; similarly the fine imposed
(Penalty inflicted) is not what causes me trouble; it is my own acts
that are troubling me; neither the King nor any one else is able to do
it.’

All this shall always be pondered over, reflected upon; and all that has
been described above as conducive to disgust with the world—thinking of
the body a hut having bones for pillars &c. (76)—this also has to be
always pondered over.

\(A\) ‘*Anadhyātmavit*’;—‘*adhyātma*’ here stands *tor mental
attitude*;—he who does not realise, does not cultivate—the
above-described mental attitude,—‘*does not obtain the reward of the
acts*’; of such acts of the Renunciate, for instance, as *begging alms,
living in the village for a single night* and so forth, he does not
obtain the ‘reward,’ in the shape of *Liberation*. That is to say, the
mere cotemplation (contemplation?) of the body as a hut with bones for
its pillars and so forth does not always bring about freedom from
longing, so long as love and hatred have not been got rid of by the
attributing of all that happens to one’s own acts. When this attitude of
the mind becomes permanently fixed, then alone is the reward obtained,
and not when it comes about only once in a way.

\(B\) \[ *Second explanation of ‘anadhyātmavit*’\]—Or, ‘*what has been
declared*’ may refer to the ‘reposing in Brahman’ (81); and the meaning
thus is that this ‘*reposing in Brahman*’ is ‘*appurtenant to
meditation*,’ and is not attained merely by the performance of acts. And
as regards the question as to what is it that has to be *meditated
upon*, the text adds ‘*nahyanadhyātmavit*’—and the term ‘*adhyātma*’
stands for those treatises on Vedānta that have been composed on the
subject of the Soul;—he who does not know this.—Or ‘*adhyātma*’ may
stand for *that which pertains to the soul*; *i.e*., such ideas as—‘the
Soul is something distinct from the body, the sense-organs, the mind,
the intellect, the life-breath and so forth, and it does not perish when
these perish;—it is neither the doer of acts nor the enjoyer of their
fruits’;—all these notions belong to one who is swayed by the idea of
diversity;—when it has destroyed all evil, it is not affected by the
taints or their effects;—being one, it is all this, there is nothing
apart from it;—diversity is only, apparent. One who does not know all
this as described in the Harisavama, Sadaka and other (?) Upaniṣads, and
does not strengthen these ideas by constant and one-pointed meditation,
does not obtain the said ‘*reward of acts*.’ The sense of the verse in
this case would be that—‘Except at the time that one is either taking
food or engaged in some necessary act, one should always keep meditating
upon the soul as described in the Vedānta and other treatises’.

\(C\) (*Third Explanation*) Or, even though the text occurs in the
section dealing with Renunciation, yet the ‘*reward of acts*’ may be
taken as referring to the Householder also; specially as it is this
latter for whom the performance of acts constitutes the most important
duly. According to this view, the meaning of the verse comes to be
this:—Though Householders may duly perform the *Agnihotra* and other
rites, yet, if they happen to be ignorant of the esoteric
sciences,—those sciences which form the very essence of the rites, in
the shape of the *Udgītha*, which is described as permeating all acts,
and with which all persona learned in rituals ore thoroughly
conversant,—they do not obtain the full reward of those rites, which
appear after a long time. This is what has been described in two *Śruti*
texts of the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka* and the *Chāndogya* Upaniṣads:—(a) ‘O
Gārgi, he who without knowing this syllable, performs sacrifices and
practises austerities even for several thousand years, all this becomes
only perishable; but what is done through full knowledge, with faith and
in full accordance with the esoteric science, becomes extremely
virile’;—that is, excellent results accrue only to him who performs acts
only after having understood the philosophy of the soul. (b) This has
also been declared in the *Chāṇḍoyya—‘Those* who know this and meditate
upon it as frith and austerity etc., etc.,’ (5.10.1). It is with
reference to these persons equipped with full knowledge and performing
the prescribed acts that the *Śruti* has declared that they reach the
region of Brahman by the path of light etc.(82).

The object to be meditated upon, for the sake of obtaining the knowledge
of the Soul, having been thus indicated, it would appear as if the
repeating of Vedic *mantras* were not required at all; hence it is this
that is enjoined by the next verse.

What this verse permits (for the Renunciate) is the mere *reciting* of
the texts, and not the repeating and getting up of them, as is
prescribed for the householder.

‘*Bearing upon sacrifices*’—*i.e*., the Brāhmaṇa texts prescribing the
sacrificial rites.

‘*Dealing with deities*’—those indicating the deities of sacrifices.

A particular kind of texts of this last class is ‘*those dealing with
the Soul*;’—*i*. *e*., ‘*aham manurabhavam* &c,’ ‘*aham rudrebhiḥ*
*etc*.’ and so forth.

*Which have been called ‘Vedānta*’—and which deal with Action and
Knowledge both. This shows that it is the combination of these two that
makes one reach Brahman.—(83)

*Baudhāyana* (2.18.20-21).—‘He shall recite the Agnihotra-mantras in the
evening and in the morning; after performing his evening-devotions by
reciting the mantras called *Vāruṇī* and his morning-devotions by
reciting the *Maitrī* verses.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.4)—‘Not to abandon sacred learning is a duty common to
all.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.4).—‘He shall discontinue the performance of all
religious ceremonies; hut he shall never discontinue the recitation of
the Veda. By neglecting the Veda he becomes a Śūdra; therefore he shall

‘*This*’ refers to the Veda; which also is Brahman; as has been declared
in the following words—‘Two Brahmans have to be recognised—the Verbal
Brahman and the Supreme Brahman; one who is thoroughly acquainted with
the Verbal Brahman reaches the Supreme One’;—one is said to become
‘acquainted with the Veda’ when he studies it, understands it and acts
according to its injunctions.

This verse is a commendatory supplement to the foregoing injunction.

‘*For the ignorant*’—those who do not understand the meaning of Vedic
texts, and are yet entitled to and desirous of their reciting. The
revered Vyāsa has declared success for the mere reciter. Or, ‘ignorant’
may mean *those not knowing the true nature of the Soul*; *i.e*., those
who have not realised, with the help of the scriptures, the real nature
of the Soul, and though engaged in meditation upon it, have not yet
acquired the requisite steadiness of the mind.

For these people the Veda is the ‘*refuge*’; as by reciting it, acting
in accordance with it and acquiring some knowledge of it, they are saved
from falling into the life of worms and insects, or into hell.

‘*This for the learned*.’ The text proceeds to show how. it is the
‘refuge’ for the learned—‘*this for those seeking heaven*;’—*i.e*.,
those who know only the Ritualistic Sections of the Veda, and have not
acquired any firm conviction regarding the Soul; and when these people
perform the rites laid down in the Veda, they obtain heaven and other
rewards. Others however, who have renounced all attachment and destroyed
all passions, and are intent upon the contemplation of the real nature
of the Soul, obtain ‘*immortality*’, *i.e*., non-return to the cycle of
births and deaths.

For all these the Veda is the only ‘*refuge*’, and there is no other
path. Such is the sense of the verse—(84)

Those who have taken to the renouncing of the Veda are called
‘*Veda-sanyāsika*,’ ‘renouncers of the Veda.’ The term ‘*veda*’
indicates the renouncing of all such acts as the pouring of libations
and the like, and not that of reciting Vedic texts; then again, as for
meditation on the soul, this has been enjoined for these men also; so
that what are forbidden Cor them are such acts as going on pilgrimages,
keeping of fasts and so forth, all which require (for their
accomplishment) wealth as well as bodily labour; and the prohibition
does not apply to such acts as the twilight-prayer, repeating of mantras
and the like, for which the man needs nothing besides himself. All this
we shall explain at the proper place.

The first half of the verse sums up the section on Renunciation, and the
second half introduces the duties of the ‘renouncer of the Veda.’—(86).

“Govindarāja is of the opinion that the persons named above (4.22) are
here intended. But from what follows (verses 94, 95) it appears that
those Brāhmaṇas are meant who, though solely intent on the acquisition
of Supreme Knowledge, and retired from all worldly affairs, continue to
reside in their houses; see also 4.257. Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa assume
that they remain Householders, while Kullūka counts them among the

**(verses 6.87-88)  
**

*Objection*:—“Inasmuch as the author has promised that he is going to
expound the duties of the Renouncer of the Veda, the assertion of the
sequence of the life-stages is entirely irrelevant.”

In answer to this some people have explained that the four life-stages
have been mentioned in the present context with a view to show that
‘Renunciation (of the Veda)’ is not a distinct stage, being included
among these same four; and the question arising as regards the
particular stage in which it is included, the present verse points out
that it is included in the state of the ‘Householder’; since the man has
to dwell in the ‘house.’

Others however point out that the said ‘Renunciation of the Veda’ is to
be included under the fourth stage of ‘going forth as a mendicant’,
since it resembles this latter on this point that in both there is
‘renouncing of attachments’; nor is any need for including it under any
one stage; because by virtue of the qualities of the man and of the
Renunciate, the man would no longer have anything to do with sacrifices
and other acts; specially as these have been enjoined by means of such
specific words and expressions as restrict them to a definite lifestage.

“But if the man belongs to no life-stage, he would be liable to the
penalty of the expiatory rite that has been prescribed for one who, for
one year, remains outside the pale of all orders.”

Since such a state of things would have been brought about by the strict
observance of the words of the text, how could there be any liability to
an expiatory penance?

From all this it follows that the other orders have been mentioned in
the present text for the purpose of eulogising Renunciation; and this
serves the purpose of lending support to the view that the. combination
of knowledge and action’ (as represented by the four orders) is
necessary (for liberation).

In view of the fact that the house is the shelter, the dwelling-place,
for all these orders, they have the Householder for their ‘*source*’,
their support. Such is the explanation of the compound.—(88)

**(verses 6.87-93)**

“According to the commentators, the following discussion (87-93) is
introduced in order to show, (1) that there are four orders only, and
that the *Vedasannyāsika* belongs to these, and does not form a fifth
order, or stand outside the orders; (2) that as the order of the
Householders is most distinguished, it is proper that a man may continue
to live in his house under the protection of his son.”—Buhler.

**(verse 6.87)**

This verse is quoted in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 445), which explains
‘*gṛhasthaprabhavāḥ*’ as ‘dependent upon the Householder’;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 64), which has the same note;—and also in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 173).

**(verse 6.88)**

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 173), which says
that ‘*kramaśaḥ*’ indicates that any inversing of the order of the
Life-stages is forbiddenand in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 64), which has the
same note.

**(verse 6.87)**

*Gautama* (3.2-3).—‘The four orders are—Student, Householder, Hermit and
*Vaikhānasa*. The Householder is the source of these, because the others
do not produce offspring.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.1).—‘There are four orders:—Householder, Student,
Hermit and Renunciate.’

*Śukranīti* (4.4.1-5).—‘The Brahmacāri, the Gṛhastha, the Vānaprastha
and the Yati are the four compulsory stages for every Brāhmaṇa. The
Brahmacāri is the disciple who wants learning; the Gṛhastha is for
maintaining all men; the Vānaprastha is for restraining the passions and
activities, and the Sanyāsi attempts the attainment of salvation.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.11-12).—‘The Student, the Householder, the Hermit and
the Renunciate.’

**(verse 6.88)**

*Gautama* (3.1).—‘Some people declare that he who has studied the Veda
may make his choice as to which among the orders he shall enter.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.2).—‘If he lives in all these four orders according to
the rules, without allowing himself to be disturbed, he will gain
liberation.’

“What is asserted here does not appear to be right. For what it means is
that the order of the Householder is directly enjoined by Vedic texts,
which speak of the others only as supported by the former. In fact, in
the event of the order of the Householder alone being directly enjoined
by the Veda, there would be no room for the other orders; because the
Vedic text (laying down Householding) would be more authoritative than
the *Smṛti* -texts laying down austerities and other things (connected
with the other orders.)’—It might be argued in this connection that—‘the
words of the present verse are not to be construed as *By reason of the
injunction of the Vedic text* (the Householder is superior), but that
*the superiority of the Householder spoken of in the Vedic text is due
to the fact of his supporting the others*; this is what is made clear by
the sentence ‘*he supports the other three*’.—It has however got to be
explained how this can be.—It may be urged that this would be so on
account of the other orders also being enjoined in the Veda.—But if they
are enjoined in the Veda, (and this is what is referred to in the
present verse), then the present -text clearly runs counter to the Smṛti
text that—‘the Householder’s order alone is directly enjoined by the
Veda’ (*Gautama*, 3.36). Nor is there any other construction
possible.—It might be urged that ‘In view of the *Jābāla-śruti*, where
we read that, having become a Householder, one shall become a Hermit,
and having become a Hermit he shall go forth as a Wandering
Mendicant,—all the orders are equally *enjoined by the Veda*’.—But even
So, the contradiction of the *Smṛti-* text remains unexplained. Then
again, this *Jābāla-śruti* is not injunctive in connection with the
other orders; it does not contain any such injunction as that ‘one shall
wander about in the forest in such and such a manner,’—such and such
acts shall be done by the man dwelling in the forest,—and such and such
by the man who has gone forth as a Wandering Mendicant’,—in the way in
which the duties of the Householder, beginning from the Laying of the
Fire and ending with the Final Sacrifice, are found to be directly laid
down; it merely mentions their name—‘having become a householder &c.’
From all this it is clear that to speak of the Householder’s order as
well as the other orders as equally enjoined in the Veda involves a
contradiction of what has gone before.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—It is true that for the man who
has taken a wife to himself, the Veda has directly enjoined the duties,
commencing with fire-laying and ending with the final sacrifice. Now, in
connection with the marriage-rite itself, we have to consider the
question as to what it is by which that act of marriage is
prompted,—whether It is prompted by the Vedic texts that speak of
persons entitled to offer the *Agni-hotra* -libations?—or by the
injunction that lays down the duty of begetting children?—or by the
visible (worldly) purpose of the man?

“What sexual love prompts is only the taking of a woman, and not the
*marriage-rite*; that alone can be regarded as prompting an act, without
which this latter could not be accomplished; and for persons influenced
by sexual love, all their domestic business would be accomplished by
simply having a woman; why then should they need to perform the
marriage-rites?”

This would be all right, if intercourse with a mere woman in general
were not forbidden. Though what the Veda says regarding the fire-laying
may apply to any woman in general, yet the scriptures always make a
distinction between the woman with whom one may, or she with whom he may
not, have inter course. It is for this reason that for men with a steady
character, the desired purpose cannot be accomplished without marriage.
So that it is only natural that there should be the idea that marriage
is prompted by the Veda itself.

“If it be as the text says, then there would be nothing to prompt the
other orders. And the purposes of all orders being accomplished by
Householdership alone, what would be the need of examining what prompts
the others. That which prompts the marriage may serve as the prompter
(of Householdership); but if Householdership alone is actually enjoined,
how could the other orders come about? Under the circumstances again,
how far would any investigation into the prompter of marriage be
justified?”

Our answer is as follows:—It has been asserted that the purposes of all
the orders are fulfilled (by Householdership). This is quite true; when
one order has been duly prompted, and the aid required by the others
becomes indirectly accomplished by the same, there can be no heed for
the assumption of what would prompt these latter. For instance, the
*Vrīhi* corn, the acquiring of which is prompted by the motive of
livelihood, is also used in the performance of rites; and there is no
acquiring of property for the purpose of the rites;—or again, even
though the unlearned man is not entitled to the performance of
sacrifices, yet the acquiring of learning is not prompted by those
performances, being, as it is, already accomplished in obedience to the
injunction of Vedic study itself. Similarly in the case in question (of
marriage), the necessary motive being already supplied by the man’s own
desires, the act does, not need the prompting of Vedic texts. Thus the
injunction of the acts to be done would be applicable to those also who
have not married.

Thus it is that the man who has all his passions deadened during the
period of Studentship itself, does not wish to marry at all; and such a
person, on account of having no companion (wife), would not be entitled
to the second order. Thus not being entitled to the rites prescribed in
the Vedic texts, he would naturally take to the next (the third) order
(having skipped over Householdership).

Others have offered the following explanation:—Marriage does not stand
on the same footing as Property. Without some property living is
impossible, as it is on property that man lives; but in the absence of
the wife living is not impossible; so that the wife is not as essential
as property; and the act of marrying a wife is prompted soley by
considerations of religious acts (which cannot be done without a wife);
and it is necessary to realise in this connection the necessity of
making every effort to become entitled to the performance of religious
acts. Otherwise, (if no such effort were necessary), having lost his
title to such acts by reason of the impurity brought about by
evacuations, if one were to omit the necessary purifying processes, he
would not be open to the charge of having omitted an obligatory duty;
under the circumstances, why should anyone take the trouble of getting
rid of the impurity caused by death and other circumstances?—It might be
argued that this latter is also itself enjoined.—Even so, the omission
would involve the transgression of this one injunction only, and not of
the thousands of injunctions (relating to the acts that the man would
perform after due purification).

In answer to this, the following arguments may be put forward:—“Of what
particular injunction would it be the meaning that ‘for the sake of
acquiring the title to the performance of religious acts, the agent
shall make an effort to accquire that title’? All the Injunctions that
there are pertain to the performance of the *Agnihotra* and other rites,
and all that they lay down is that the acts therein specified ought, to
be performed, and they do not urge the bringing into existence of the
Fires. These fires are kindled, in connection with the voluntary acts,
by the man who undertakes them through desire for the rewards to be
obtained from them; and it is only when these Fires have been thus
kindled that the man becomes ‘one who has laid the Fires,’ and hence
subject to the injunctions relating to the lifelong performance of the
*Agnihotra* rites. Then again, it is only the man with a wife that is
entitled to the ‘laying of fire’; so that the man would desire to marry
a wife in the same manner as he lays the Fires for the purpose of
acquiring the title to the performance of religious acts. So that the
sense of no Injunction is offended if one omits to acquire the title to
the performance of the Agnihotra and other rites \[simply because there
is no such Injunction as that one *shall acquire this title* \]. Nor
does the Injunction of Marriage itself indicate that *marriage shall be
performed*; because the act of Marriage is a sanctificatory or
sacramental rite, just like the Vedic rites of the obligatory daily
*Agnihotra* and other rites; specially as no rewards are mentioned in
connection with it.”

In answer to this the ancients offer the following explanation: There is
a direct Vedic text laying down the paying off of the ‘three
debts’—‘When the Brāhmaṇa is born, he is born beset with three debts &c.
&c.’; and this text becomes applicable to the man as soon as he is born;
this ‘birth’ can not refer to the second ‘birth’ in the form of
‘Initiation’; as in that case, the man would be as good as an animal,
prior to his ‘Initiation’. In fact the exact time referred to by the
passage speaking of the ‘debts’ is that at which the man, having been
born, comes to realise his responsibilities. Thus then, after the has
accquired learning and thus become entitled to marry, if after having
sought for a bride, he fails to obtain one and becomes grey, he would
certainly be entitled to proceed to the stage of the Hermit. In fact,
such a man comes to the following conclusion—‘all through my youth I
have been seeking for a bride;—they say that Fire-laying has been
enjoined for only such men as have their hair still black;—and by the
man of grey hairs Fire is not to be laid except in the event of his wife
having died,—such is the meaning that they attribute to the Vedic
Injunction’.

The ‘*Householder is the best of all*’, because of his connection with
religious acts; hence the superiority belongs to the *stage* itself (not
to the *man*).

‘*These three*.’—That it supports the other three stages is another
ground for its superiority. This is what has been referred to by the
text—‘By means of knowledge and by good &c. &c.’—(89).

This same dea (idea?) is further supported by means of an example.—

all the scriptures lay down in great detail the duties of the

*Gautama* (3.36).—‘The venerable teacher prescribes one order only;
because the order of Householders is explicitly prescribed.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.14).—‘A householder alone performs sacrifices; a
householder alone performs austerities; and the order of Householders is
the most distinguished among the four.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.27-29).—‘These three—the Student, the Hermit and the
Renunciate—derive their subsistence from the order of Householders;
therefore must a Householder not treat them with disdain, when they have
arrived. The Householder offers sacrifices, the Householder practises
austerities, the Householder distributes gifts; therefore is the order
of Householders the best of all.’

‘*Rivers*’—the Gaṅgā and the rest;—‘*rivulets*’—the Bhidya and others.
The distinction between ‘rivers’ and ‘rivulets’ is based upon the
difference of position or of taste.

In actual usage both are treated as one and the same; and the diversity
of gender (in that case) is explained as standing on the same footing as
that in the ease of the synonymous words ‘*bhāryā*’ (feminine) and
‘*dārā*’ (Masculine).

‘*Resting place*’—support.

Just as the Ocean is the resting place for all kinds of water, so is the
Householder entitled to the performance of all duties—(90)

Steadiness and the rest are qualities of the Soul.

\(1\) ‘*Steadiness*’—the feeling of contentment even at the loss of
property and such things; expressed by such feelings as ‘if it has been
lost, what does it matter? It can be acquired again.’ Similarly at
separation from a beloved person, the man regains former equanimity by
thinking that ‘such is the way of the world.’

\(2\) ‘*Forgiveness*’— the excusing of wrongs committed; not seeking to
do injury to a person in return for an injury that might have been done
by him.

\(3\) ‘*Self-control*’—absence of haughtiness, renouncing of pride due
to superior learning &c.

\(4\) ‘*Absention from unrighteous appropriation*’:—this is well known.

\(5\) ‘*Purity*’—cleanliness of food etc.

\(6\) ‘*Control of the Sense-organs*’—not allowing them to be drawn even
towards unforbidden things.

\(7\) ‘*Discrimination*’—true knowledge, following upon the refutation
of all doubtful and contrary views.

\(8\) ‘*Knowledge*’ of the Soul. The difference between ‘discrimination’
and ‘knowledge’ is that the former refers to *Acts*, and the latter to
the *Soul*.

In view of this tautology, some people read ‘*Dhīvidyā*’ (wise
discrimination). But this is not right; specially as we have explained
the difference between the two.

The rest are well known.

‘*Absence of anger*’ is not permitting anger to arise when there is an
occasion for it, and ‘*forgiveness*’ is not doing harm to others even
when they may have done harm to one.—(92).

**(verse 6.92)  
**

‘*Dhṛtiḥ*’—‘Fortitude, calmness even on the loss of wealth and such
other calamities’;—‘firmness of purpose in the discharge of duties’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Damaḥ*’—‘Humility’ (Medhātithi);—‘patience under sufferings’
(Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘subjugation of the mind’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda).

‘*Dhīḥ*’—‘True knowledge, free from doubts and errors (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja);—‘knowledge of the true meaning of the śāstras’ (Kullūka
and Rāghvānanda);—Nārāyaṇa and Nandana, reading ‘*hrīḥ*’, explain it as
‘modesty’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 972), which explains ‘*śaucam*’
as ‘purity of mind and body’,—‘*dhīḥ*’ as ‘discrimination of right and
wrong’,—‘*dhṛtiḥ*’ as ‘keeping the mind from going astray’,—‘*damaḥ*’ as
‘controlling of the mind by means of the *Kṛcchra* and other
austerties’. It adds that this verse enumerates the duties common to all
the four orders;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 16a);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 13), which has the following
notes;—‘*Dhṛti*’, firmness,—‘*kṣamā*’ is nonperturbation of the mind
even when wronged,—‘*dama*’ is control of the ‘mind’,—‘*asteya*’ is
non-appropriation of what is not given,—‘*śauca*’ is cleanliness, both
internal and external,—‘*indriyanigraha*’ is keeping the senses from all
forbidden objects,—‘*hrī*’ (which is its reading for ‘*dhī*’) is
cessation from improper acts,—‘*vidyā*’ is self-knowledge—‘*satya*’ is
saying what is true, which should be *agreeable* also,—‘*akrodha*’ is
freedom from anger.

self-consciousness, unbelief, dishonesty, self-praise, blaming others,
deceit, covetousness, delusion, anger, and envy is considered to be the
duty of all orders.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.66).—‘Truthfulness, abstention from unrighteous
appropriation and anger, modesty, purity, discrimination, steadiness,
self-control, control over sense-organs and learning—these have been
declared to be *universal dharma*.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 30).—‘To all men—desisting from injuring others,
truthfulness, purity, freedom from jealousy and cruelty and
forgiveness.’

*Kāmandaka* (3.34-36).—‘Not to find no fault with others, to observe his
own duties, to show compassion for the distressed, to address sweet
words to all, to save friends even at the cost of his life, to welcome
enemies coming to the house, to practise charity commensurate with his
resources, to be against sufferings, to conciliate estranged friends, to

‘*Being freed from debts, should take to Renunciation*.’—This text is
meant to lay down that Renunciation should come only after the three
debts have been paid off. Just as all men are not entitled to go forth
as a mendicant at the same period of their life, so with Renunciation
also.

‘*Having duly learnt the Vedānta texts*’.—There is no renunciation for
one who has not learnt what is contained in the *Vedānta* texts. Though
the performance of Rites, as well as the learning of the Vedānta, are
both implied in the injunction of ‘Vedic study’—both kinds of texts
being equally ‘Veda,’—yet the learning of the Vedānta texts has been
reiterated here for the purpose of laying special stress on it; the
sense being that ‘the man shall devote himself entirely to it’.

“What is the actual meaning of the injunction.—‘*shall take to
Renunciation*’? What is thia that is called ‘Renunciation’?”

‘Renunciation’ consists of abandoning the notion that ‘this is *mine*’.

“What have been referred to above are the ‘*Renouncers of the Veda*’,
from which it would seem as if there were ‘renunciation’ of the ‘Veda’
or of ‘what is contained in the Veda’,—and not that of such acts as the
*accepting of gifts* and the like, which are done for the purpose of
enabling the man to perform the acts enjoined by the Veda.”

In verse 84 above it has been declared that the Veda is the ‘refuge for
those seeking immortality’; so that Vedic study is enjoined even for
that stage at which *Knowledge* (and not Action) becomes the
predominating factor in one’s life. In as much as the *Agnihotra* and
other rites are accomplished with the help of material substances, they
naturally become *renounced* when there is no sense of property (the
notion *of mine*). Such ‘renunciation’ is meritorious only for one whose
wife is dead, or who, having made arrangements for the upkeep of bis
Fires, concentrates his attention on the Supreme Self. We read in the
*Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad*—‘when he thinks of going away, he says to his
son &c. &c.,’ which lays down the handing over of the Fires. This
renunciation of the Fires is enjoined also for the decrepit old man—‘By
decrepitude does he become absolved from this.’ Those rites however
which do not take the aid of material substances—such for instance as
the Twilight Prayers, the daily *Agnihotra* and the like—the performance
of these being not forbidden, one remains entitled to it till his very
last breath.—(94).

‘*Having studied the Veda*’;—this implies that the Veda shall not be
given up. This has been already explained above.

The right reading would appear to be the present-participial form
‘*abhyasyan*,’ ‘studying.’

‘*He shall live at ease under the protection of his son*’;—*i.e*., if he
has a son born to him; or of any other person who may be in the place of
his son; such, for instance as his grandson. They say that in this case
also one should retire to another house.—(95).

‘*Fourfold Duty*’—pertaining to the four life-stages; all this has been
expounded for the *Brāhmaṇa*.

“At the outset the text has spoken of the *twice-born person*, in the
opening verse—‘Having thus lived the life of the. Householder, the
accomplished *twice-born person* &c. &c.’, and it has been decided that
the term stands for all the three castes, as there is no sort of
incongruity involved in this. Under the circumstances, the term
‘*brāhmaṇa*’ of the present verse should also be taken as standing for
all the three castes. There would be a justification for denying this
only if the entire Discourse did not form one organic whole, beginning
from the opening verse and ending with the present verse. As a matter of
fact, the opening verse is perfectly amenable to being construed with
this last verse (the whole discourse thus forming one organic whole); so
that it is quite open to us to take this verse as referring to what has
been mentioned in the opening verse.”

As a matter of fact, the sentence is regarded as having that meaning
which is found to be expressed by it, after a thorough consideration of
the sentence as a whole. And in this way, it is distinctly more
reasonable to take the term ‘twice-born person’ (of the opening verse)
us standing for the *Brāhmaṇa* (rather than the other wav). Because
every ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ also is ‘twice-born’, but every ‘twice-born person’
is not a ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’. So that the term ‘twice-born’ being capable of
being directly applied to the *Brāhmaṇa*, it cannot be right to take the
term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ as indirectly indicating the wider circle of
*twice-born* persons.

“But in the *Mahābhārata* we find three life-stages laid down for the
*Śūdra* also;—having started with the words ‘for the *Śūdra* who has
accomplished all his work, there is *attendance*, it goes on to say ‘all
the life-stages have been prescribed for him, except the
*Nirāmiṣa*’—that is Renunciation.”

This is not right. Such is not the meaning of the text quoted; what it
means is as follows—‘the *Śūdra* should not have recourse to the four
stages, he obtains the reward of all the stages by means of *service*
and the *begetting* *of* *children*’;—which means that—‘during
Householdership he obtains, by means of serving the twice-born men, the
rewards of all stages, with the sole exception of Liberation, which is
the reward of Renunciation.’

From this it follows that the Four Life-stages are meant for the
*Brāhmaṇa* only.—(97)



Thus ends the *Bhāṣya* on Discourse VI.

Printed by Rameshwar Pathak at the Tara Printing Works, Benares.

Buhler is not right in asserting that “according to Medhātithi the word
‘*brāhmaṇā*’ is not intended to exclude other Aryans (*dvijas*)”.—He has
evidently been misled by the words in which Medhātithi has set forth an
objection to the text using the word ‘Brāhmaṇa’. See *Translation*.

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.57) in
support of the view that the *Brāhmaṇa alone* is entitled to enter the
fourth stage of the Renunciate;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 564) to
the same effect;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 176),—which says that
‘*brāhmaṇa*’ here stands for all the twice-born persons;—and in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 65) which quotes ‘my grand-father’ to the effect
that ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ stands for all twice-born men,—while it itself favours
the view that it stands for the *Brāhmaṇa only*.
