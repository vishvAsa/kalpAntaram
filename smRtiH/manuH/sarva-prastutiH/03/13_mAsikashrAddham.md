*The śrāddha* described here is the compulsory one, as distinct from the
*Vaiśvadeva-śrāddha*, which is optional.

‘*On the moon-leas day*’— on the *Amāvāsya* day. There also not at any
and every time, but only ‘*after having performed the Pitṛyajña*.’ That
is, after having performed that *Ptṛyajña* which has been prescribed in
the *Śruti*. Thus the time for the *Śrāddha* in question comes to be the
same as that for this latter; and in connection with this it has been
laid down that the *Piṇḍapitṛyajña* is to be performed on the *Amāvāsya*
day, in the afternoon.’

Even for one who has not set up the fire, the performance of such
offerings is essential; as it is declared—‘the person who has not set up
the fire having made the accessary offerings &c.’

‘*The Brāhmaṇa with the fire*’—*i.e*., he who is keeping up the
marriage-fire, or who has set up the fire since succession to his
property. No significance is meant to be attached to the mention of the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ since the *śrāddha* in question is meant to be performed
by the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* also; hence it is that other *smṛtis*
have prescribed this *śrāddha* without special reference to any
particular caste.

‘*Piṇḍānvāhārya* *kam*;’—this is the proper name of this *śrāddha*; the
etymological explanation is that ‘that which is offered along with balls
of food, *Piṇḍas*, is *piṇḍānvāhāryaka*.’

‘*Month after month*,’—in one month, and also in another month. The
compound word connotes monthly repetition; thus the meaning is that the
*śrāddha* is to be performed every month. Thus it is that its compulsory
character becomes established. Though the term ‘*anumāsa*’ alone
dignities repetition, and the second term ‘*māsa*’ is superfluous, yet
prolixity (anti redundance) is not minded in a metrical treatise.—(122)

“The sacrifice identified by the term *Pitṛyajña* is the so-called
*Piṇḍapitṛyajña*, a Śrauta rite (Āśvalāyana, Śrauta-sūtra 2.6-7); and
*Piṇḍānvāhāryaka* is another name for the monthly Śrāddha.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 165), where it is explained
as laying down the order of sequence between *Piṇḍapitṛyajña* and
*Piṇḍānvāhāryaka*, as performed by the man with the consecrated
fire;—the particle ‘*anu*’ denotes repetition;—‘*candrakṣaye*’ means ‘on
the *Amāvasyā* day.’

It is quoted in *Kālaviveka* (p. 354) as laying down *Śrāddha* to be
performed on the *Amāvasyā* day.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 321) quotes it in support of the view that all
those texts that lay down the Vaiśvadeva offering as to be done before
the *Śrāddha*, are to be taken as applying only to the *man who has set
up the Śrauta Fire* (which is what is meant by the term ‘*agnimān*’ in
the present verse);—again on p. 495, where it adds that
‘*māsānumāsikam*’ means ‘every month’; and goes on to explain that
*Piṇḍapitṛyajña* is to be performed also by the man who has not set up
the *Śrauta* Fire; so that for the man with the ‘Śrauta Fire,’ as well
as for the man with the ‘Domestic Fire,’ it is necessary to perform
*Anvādhāna, Piṇḍapitṛyajña* and *Amāvasyā-Śrāddha*,—all on the same day.

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 40) quotes this verse as permitting the performance
of Śrāddha on a day on which there is *Caturdaśī* in the morning but
*Amāvasyā* for the rest of the day.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 418), which remarks that the repetitive
form of the term ‘*māsānumāsikam*’ is meant to imply that the Śrāddha on
the Amāvasyā day is compulsory;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 609) to the
effect that ‘*Pitṛyajña*’ should be performed before the ‘*Śrāddha*’;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 72,171,321 and 1064);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*
(pp. 956 and 989) to the effect that the *Amāvasyā-Śrāddha* should be
performed after *Piṇḍapitṛyajña*; it explains ‘*Piṇḍānvāhāryakam*’ as
*Piṇḍānām piṇḍapitṛyajñārthānām anu paścāt āhṛyate kṛyate iti*,’ and
calls it a name for the *Amāvasyā*

*Śrāddha*;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 185), which explains
‘*Piṇḍānvāhāryakam*’ as *Pārvaṇaśrāddha*, and expounds the same as
‘*piṇḍāḥ anu brāhmaṇabhojanānantaram āhriyante asmin*’;—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 6) as laying down *Amāvasyā-Śrāddha*;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, pp. 431 and 492).

*Sumantu* (Aparārka, p. 418).—‘The man with the fire shall offer Śrāddha
to those to whom his father offers it.’

*Maitrāyaṇīya-pariśiṣṭa* (Do.).—‘Marriage, the birth of a son, the
Pitrya Iṣṭi, Soma-sacrifice, sacred places, and the arrival of the right
Brāhmaṇa,—these are occasions for the performance of Śrāddha by one
whose father is living.’

*Viṣṇu* (Do.).—‘If the man with his father living performs Śrāddha, he
should offer it to those to whom his father offers it; if his
grandfather is alive, to those to whom the grandfather offers it; if his
father, grandfather and greatgrandfather are all alive, he shall not
offer it at all.’

*Gautama* (15.2).—‘During the later fortnight, from the fifth day
onwards, Śrāddha shall be performed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 217).—‘The Moonless day, the Aṣṭakās, the Auspicious
ceremonies, the darker fortnight, the two solstices...... (these are the
occasions for Śrāddha).’

*Vyāsa* (Aparārka, p. 417).—‘The Moonless day on which the moon sets
after appearing is called *Sinīvālī*; on that day should Śrāddha be
offered by Agnihotrins; and that day on which the moon is entirely
invisible (called *Kuhū*), on that it should be offered by Brāhmaṇas
without fire and by others.’

*Laugākṣi* (Do., p. 418).—‘The man whose father is dead should offer
Śrāddha every day, also every month on the moonless day, on auspicious
occasions and also every year.’

*Uśanas* (Aparārka, p. 418).—‘The twice-born man whose father has died
shall offer Śrāddha every day—be he with Fire or without Fire; also
every month and every year.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘While one’s father is living, one should avoid all
Śrāddhas; but according to some people, he should offer it to those
Pitṛs to whom his father offers it.’

‘*Anvāhārya*’ is the name of the fee paid to the priests officiating at
the *Darṣa-Pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices; and the monthly *śrāddha* offered to
the Pitṛs is the ‘Anvāhārya fee’ for the Ancestors; and the sense of the
metaphor is that the Pitṛs are as much pleased on receiving the
*śrāddha-ofterings* as the Priests are on receiving the fee. This name
serves to indicate that the *śrāddha* is performed for the Pitṛs. But
the relation in which the Ancestors stand to the *śrāddha* is not the
same in which the Deities stand to the *Darśa* and other sacrifices; as
the *śrāddha* is performed for their benefit; and it is in this sense
that we have the genitive case in ‘*pitṛṛṇām* (*pitṝṇām*?)’; if the
Pitṛs were the ‘deities,’ then there would be no reason for the omitting
of the Dative affix.

Another reading giving a totally different sense is ‘*piṇḍānām
māsikam*.’

‘*The wise call Anvāhārya*’— This also indicates the obligatory
character of the *Pitṛ-yajña* (which is as necessary as the sacrificial
gift); but with this difference that it is not a mere subordinate factor
(as the sacrificial fee is).

‘*It should be performed with such meat as has been comended*’—*i.e*.,
not prohibited, or particularly recommended; as in 268, where it is said
‘with the meat of fish the Ancestors remain satisfied for two months,
etc., etc.’

This is the principal method; in the absence of meat, curds, butter,
milk, cakes, etc., shall be offered, as is going to be prescribed later
on.

The meat, however, is only the sauce for the seasoning of such food as
cooked rice and the like; it does not consti-tute a food by itself,
since the text is going to describe ‘such subsidiaries us soup and
vegetables, etc.’ (226), and also ‘on what kinds of food, etc.’ (next
verse).—(123)

The question that arises now is that the *śrāddha* consisting of the
several acts of (*a*) oblations in fire, (*b*) feeding of Brāhmaṇas,
(*c*) offering of hulls of food, and so forth,—are they all equally
principal and expressible by the name ‘*śrāddha*?’ Or, some are
principal and some secondary? The answer is that, in view of suoh
expressions as—‘one should feed Brāhmaṇas in *śrāddha*,’ ‘this man has
eaten at the *śrāddha*,’ and so forth, where ‘feeding’ and ‘*śrāddha*’
are spoken of as synonyms,—the ‘feeding of Brāhmaṇas appears to be the
principal factor.’ To the same end our Author says—

‘*At* *it*’—at the *śrāddha*;—those Brāhmaṇas that should be fed,—as
also those that should be avoided;—‘*how* *many*’—what number; as is

(267) all this ‘*I am now going to describe*’— listen-to it.

This (feeding of Brāhmaṇas) is the chief thing to be accomplished; for
without this the *śrāddha* is as good as not done. As for the subsidiary
factors,—those that help in the performance directly, as well as those
that help indirectly,—even if these are not duly accomplished, the
*śrāddha* is done,—only it is not quite complete in its details. Hence
it is that the subjects have been propounded again, for the purpose of
indicating their predominant character.—(124.)

*Medhātithi* (p. 241, l. 25)—‘*Yaccāṅgajātam etc*.’—The Mīmāṃsakas,
specially those belonging to the ‘Prābhākara’ school, classify
‘subsidiaries to an act’ under four heads:—(1) class-character, (2)
quality, (3) substance, and (4) such things as are denoted by verbs,
*i.e*., actions. The last of these is grouped under two heads—(1) Those
directly helpful, called *Sannipatyopakāraka*, and (2) those indirectly
helpful, called ‘*Ārādupakāraka*’. That which produces its direct
effects in certain things conducive to the fulfilment of the sacrificial
act, is its *Sannipatyopakāraka*; *e.g*., the *sitting* of the
sacrifìcer, the *threshing of the corn* and so forth. The
*Sannipatyopakāraka* is of four kinds—(1) that which brings into
existence a certain substance; *i.e*., the kneading of the flour, which
brings into existence the dough;—(2) that which leads to the acquisition
of a certain substance; *e.g*., the act of milking the cow;—(3) that
which produces some change in an already existing substance; *e.g*., the
boiling of clarified butter;—(4) that which is purely purificatory,
*e.g*., the sprinkling of water over the corn. The subsidiaries that
belong to this class do not produce any transcendental result—

*Apūrva*—of their own; they are related to the result produced by the
sacrificial act to which they are subsidiary......... The

*Ārāpudakāraka*—or indirectly helpful subsidiaries—are of two kinds—(1)
those that fulfil only a transcendental purpose and do not produce any
visible effects in any material substance; *e.g*., the small offerings
made during the *Darśapūrṇamāsa*, such as the *Samid-yāga* and the
rest;—and (2) those that produce both transcendental and visible
effects; *e.g*., the *Payovrata*, the act of the Sacrificer and his wife
living, during the performance of the *Jyotiṣṭoma*, purely on milk.
These latter, from their very nature, are such acts as have their own
*minor* resultant *Apūrvas*, which go to help in the fulfilment of the
*Apūrva* of the main sacrificial act itself. \[For a discussion on this
subject, the reader is referred to the *Prābhakara School of Pūrva
Mīmāṃsā*, pp. 180-185.\]

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 377).

Though as a rule each subject should be propounded in the same order in
which it has been mentioned before,—and according to this the *persons
to be fed* should have been described first,—yet the present verse
describes their *number* first; because there is very little to be said
on this point.

With reference to the gods, one should feed two Brāhmaṇas, and at the
rite performed in honour of the Pitṛs he should feed three; ‘*or one at
each of the two*’—*i.e*., one at the rite in honour of the Gods and one
at that in honour of the Pitṛs.

Though the word used in the Text is ‘*pitṛ*,’ which shows that the
entity to whom the offering is to be made is the *Father*, yet, as a
matter of fact, the offering is to be made to the Father, grandfather
and great-grandfather. Hence, at the *śrāddha*, one should food one
Brāhmaṇa for each of these three,—and not one only for all three;
because each of them constitutes a distinct ‘recipient of offering.’
Says the author of the *Gṛhyasūtra* (Āśvnlāyana, 4. 7.2-4)—‘Not only one
for all; it has been explained by means of the balls;’ that is, just as
only one ball is not offered to all, so only one Brāhmaṇa should not be
fed for all. Here also the author will say later on—‘he should invite at
least three;’ and the invitation there spoken of is for the purpose of
feeding them, and not for the purpose of any merely transcendental
result. It is for this reason that at the rite in honour of ancestors
one should feed three,—that is, three times three, specially as it has
been declared that ‘one should not feed the least number.’ This same
explanation *applies also to what is said below (in 129*) regarding the
feeding ‘even one learned person at each;’ which means that one for each
of the three ancestors.

Further, the words ‘*or only one at each of the two*’ does not contain
an injunction; it is only a reiteration made for the propose of
introducing the prohibition of ‘large company;’ just as we have in the
statement—‘eat poison, do not eat in his house.’

“If that be so, then the assertion ‘he should feed two at the rite in
honour of the gods’ also may not be an injunction; as this also could be
explained as subservient to something else. If, however, this be
regarded as an Injunction, on the ground that what it says is not
knowable from any other source,—then, why cannot the statement ‘one at
each’ also be an Injunction?”

The answer to this is that neither of the two statements may be regarded
as an Injunction.

“Whence, then, could we know the number (to be fed)?”

From the assertion—‘he should invite at least three.’

“But in that passage there is no mention of the rite in honour of the
gods.”

Well, in that case, we can learn the number from another *Smṛti*:—‘an
odd number, according to one’s enthusiasm,’ ‘an even number at the rite
in honour of the gods’ (Yājñavalkya, *ācāra*, 227).

Further, if the present verse contained an Injunction of the number to
be fed, then, since there would be no possibility of any idea arising
regarding the ‘large company,’ the prohibition of it would be absolutely
uncalled for.

From all this it follows that only so many Brāhmaṇas should be fed, by
feeding whom one would not fall into those difficulties that might arise
from the feeding of too many men. That is, at the rite in honour of the
ancestors, an odd number, and at that in honour of the gods, only two.

Even when the man is extremely wealthy,—very rich,—‘*he should, not
indulge in large company*.’—(125)

This prohibition of feeding a very large number is not with a view to
any transcendental result. In fact—

Buhler is not quite fair to Medhātithi when he says that he takes the
first part of the verse in a peculiar manner, “one must feed two
Brāhmaṇas at the offering to the gods and three for each ancestor (or
nine in all) at the offering to the manes”. This is not quite what
Medhātithi takes the text *to mean*; what he mentions is what ought to
be done, in consideration of the other texts that he quotes.

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 511);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 24b);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 159 and
114);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 94), which explains ‘*ubhayatra*’
as ‘one in *Devakṛtya* and one in *Pitṛkṛtya*.’

The first quarter of this verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 698) as laying down the proportion of Brāhmaṇas to be fed at the two
sorts of rites. If five Brāhmaṇas are to be fed, two should be fed in
connection with the offering to the Gods and three in connection with
that to the *Pitṛs*.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 592) quotes the verse, and explains that the
forbidding of the feeding of a large company is based on the fear that
if a large number of people are invited at a time or place not quite
suited for the purpose, there may be many defects that, would go to
vitiate the entire rite.

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 287) quotes this verse;—also *Aparārka* (p. 430),
which adds that the term ‘*Pitṛ*’ here includes the maternal grandfather
and all those who have been declared to be ‘deities’ (for the
Śrāddha);—again on p. 463, where it adds that it is meant to eulogise
the lesser number, and not to prohibit large numbers; if it meant the
latter, it would be wrong to feed a large number of men, which is
actually enjoined by other *Smṛtis*.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.24).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Gautama* (15.8, 21).—‘At least nine; or an odd number; or any number,
in accordance with his zeal; (the man invited) should be possessed of
excellent qualities.’

*Viṣṇu* (73, 3-4).—‘In connection with the offering to the gods one
should feed two men, who should be facing the east; and in connection
with the offering to Pitṛs, three men, who should he facing the north;
or one in connection with each of the two offerings.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.227-229).—‘At the offering to gods, an even number, and
at that to Pitṛs, an odd number of Brāhmaṇas should be invited, to the
best of one’s capacity. Two men facing the east, in connection with the
offering to the gods; three facing the north, in connection with the
offering to Pitṛs; or one in connection with each of the two offerings;
so also in the case of the offering to the maternal grand-fathers.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.2).—‘Brāhmaṇas endowed with learning and
character and good conduct, invited in time, bathed and purified, should
be made to face the north, as if they were Pitṛs, either one or two or
three for each one of the Pitṛs; but never only one for all.’

or two Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda.’

*Śaunaka* (Do.).—‘Two for each Pitṛ; one for each; or three for each.’

*Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa* (Do., p. 699).—‘Even though he has the capacity, he
should feed less than nine, never more; so say those who perceive
difficulties in feeding a large number,’

*Vṛddha-Bṛhaspati* (Do.).—‘At the rite in honour of Pitṛs and gods, one
shall feed one or two or three on behalf of each; due honour and
observance of right time and place cannot be fulfilled if there is an
excess.’

Since ‘large company’ entails all these defects, therefore ‘large
company’ is not considered desirable. When, however, respectful
treatment and the rest are found feasible, then one might net according
to one’s enthusiasm.

‘*Respectful treatment*’—careful preparation of the food.

‘*Place*’—ground sloping to the south, and so forth (which has been
recommended for *Śrāddhas*), as one going to be described below (in
207).

‘*Time*’—the afternoon; laid dowu in such texts as ‘when the sun has
just passed the meridian, &c.’

‘*Purity*’—of oneself, of the Brāhmaṇas invited, and of his own
servants.

‘*Qualities of Brāhmaṇas*’—the obtaining of qualified Brāhmaṇas.

All these advantages are such as must be secured; and these are hampered
by having a large company; hence large company becomes a drawback; and
this is involved in inviting too many Brāhmaṇas. *Hence ‘one should not
seek*’—bring together—‘*a large company*.’— (126)

‘Rites performed for the gods’ are not regarded as conferring any
benefit on the gods; such, however, is not the case with this rite which
is named ‘*Pitrya*.’ “What then?” It is ‘*known*,’ among people learned
in the Vedas as ‘*beneficial to the dead*’—as conferring a benefit on
the dead.

‘*On the moonless night*’—on the day on which there is no moon; *i.e*.,
the *amārasyā* day. Another residing is ‘*vidhikṣaye*.’ But the most
faultless reading is ‘*vidhuhṣaye*.’ The meaning of the former would be
that the rile named *Pitryā* is one that has been prescribed as to be
done in the house.

‘*Upon this*’—upon this rite,—‘*he who is intent*’—he who is busy with
its performance. To him there ‘*always accrues*,’ ‘*benefit after
death*;’ *i.e*., for him also benefit after death is conferred by his
sons performing the *śrāddha* and other rites for him.

What this means is that the continuity of the lines of one’s
descendants—sons and grandsons—is the reward of performing *śrāddhas*.
But this reward is not the incentive to its performance; as the rite has
already been described as an obligatory one.

Others, however, have regarded this as indicating another incentive, for
one desiring continuity of his line.

‘*Offered according to human ordinances*’:—*i.e*., this rite is
performed according to rules laid down in the *Smṛtis*.—(127)

‘*Learned in the Veda*’—he who recites the entire Vedic text, Mantras as
well as Brāhmaṇas: to him;—‘the food offered to the gods’—*i*.*e*.,
those articles of food that are offered, in connection with *Śrāddhas to
the* *Visve-devas*:—‘*should be given*;’—as also ‘*the food offered*
*to* *the Pitṛs*,’

‘*Most deserving*;’—‘desert (deserve?)’ here stands for *respectability*
and *ability*. It is a person born of a noble family that is respected;
and a person born of a noble family is generally equipped with learning
and character.

‘*What is given to him*,’—even things other than the *Śrāddha-*
offerings,—‘*is conducive to great results*.’ The meaning is that—‘gift
made to the unlearned is fruitless; that made to a person learned in the
Veda, but devoid of nobility and other good qualities, is conducive to
some slight results; and that to the most deserving is conducive to
great results.’—(128)

‘*By feeding at least one learned Brāhmaṇa, one obtains a full

One is not to be fed simply because he is thoroughly versed in the Veda;
in fact, he should be examined ‘*from far off*;’ *i.e*., one should
carefully ascertain the purity of his father’s and mother’s families. It
has been declared that persons should be regarded as real Brāhmaṇaa on
both sides, only when it is found that everyone of their ancestors on
the father’s and on the mother’s side up to ten degrees were
accomplished in learning and austerities and their acts were virtuous;
this is what constitutes ‘examination from far off;’ similarly, the
man’s own learning and knowledge of practical details should be
ascertained.

‘*Vedapāragaḥ*’—he who has gone to the end of the Veda; *i.e*., one does
not become respected by reading the *Saṃhitā* only, or the *Brāhmaṇa*
only. Because we find this term used here, we conclude that the term
‘*śrotriya*’ is applied to one who may have learnt only a portion of the
Veda.

‘*Such a one is the channel for offerings to gods and
Pitṛs*;’—‘*channel*’ means *like a channel*. The ‘channel’ is that
whereby people descend to the water; hence what is meant by the metaphor
is the eulogium that ‘just as people seeking water get it only if they
go to it by the right channel, similarly, the offerings reach the gods
and ancestors only through the aforesaid *Brāhmaṇa*.’

In connection with gifts and charities also the Brāhmaṇa is the ‘guest.’
To the guest that arrives by himself, gifts are offered freely, and thus
given, they bring about great results; and, in the same manner, to the
said Brāhmaṇa the offerings to gods and ancestors should be given
freely; and when thus given, they become conducive to great
results.—(130)

‘*Anṛcām (Anṛcām?*)’, ‘*ignorant of the Veda*,’—those who do not know
the meaning of the Vedic verses.

This is only by way of illustration; since there is no possibility of
persons ignorant of the Veda being fed; because of the restriction that
the food shall be offered only to one learned in the Veda. The affix at
the end of this compound has been dropped because of the term being
Vedic, and also because of the exigencies of metre. They say—‘one had
better read *maṣa* in place of *māṣa* rather than distort the metre.’

Or, we may read ‘*anṛcā*’ in the Nominative Plural; the construction
being ‘thousand persons ignorant, &c.’ just as we have the phrase
‘thousand bulls.’

‘*A single man learned in the Veda*’—knowing the meaning of the Veda—‘on
*being satisfied*’—*i.e*., fed—‘absorbs all those’ ignorant persons;
*i.e*., becomes identified with them; and in face of this identity, the
result that might accrue from the feeding of those thousands would be
obtained by the feeding of a single learned man; this is the sense got
at. from the text.

This deprecation of the ignorant person is meant to be a praise of the
learned man; and it does not really mean that the feeding of a single
man produces results equal to those produced by feeding a thousand.
Further, inasmuch as the scriptures lay down the feeding of the learned
only, there is no possibility of the ignorant ever being fed. It may be
that people might think that, in the absence of the fully learned man
(thoroughly versed in the Veda), the feeding of the man⁽learned in the
Veda’ (who is comparatively *ignorant*) laid down in verse 128 above
permits, under certain conditions, the feeding of ignorant persons also;
and in view of this, for the purpose of preventing the prohibition of
feeding a ‘large company’ from applying to the case of ignorant persons
also, the present text may be taken in its direct sense (whereby the
feeding of thousands of ignorant persons is permitted).—(131)

should be employed in rites sacred to Pitṛs and Gods; whatever is
offered to such a one is imperishable without doubt.’

One who is ‘*distinguished*’—who excels—‘*by knowledge*’—in learning; to
such a one ‘*should be given*’ ‘*the offerings for gods and Pitṛs*.’

The sense of the metaphor of the ‘*hand smeared with bloo*’ is as
follows:—‘Hands smeared with blood when washed with blood only become
all the more reddened, and they are not cleansed; similarly, the
ignorant *Brāhmaṇa*, when, fed, only carries the ancestors to still

*Āśvalāyana* (1.50).—‘The good man who constantly offers food into the
mouth of one learned in the Veda, becomes freed from heinous sins and
attains union with Brahman.’

*Āśvalāyana* (14.15).—‘At the Śrāddha one shall invite such Brāhmaṇas as
are fully learned in the Rig Veda; in the absence of these, he may
invite persons learned in other recensions of the Veda.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.9-13).—‘The offerings made to Gods and Pitṛs should be
presented to the person learned in the Veda; what is presented to one
who is not learned in the Veda reaches neither the Pitṛs nor the
Gods;—that man who has an illiterate person in his bouse and the learned
man at a distance, should present the offering to the learned man; this
would not be a supersession of the illiterate man; there can be no
wrongful supersession of the Brāhmaṇa who is devoid of the Veda; no one
pours oblations into ashes and neglects the burning fire; those regions
where illiterate persons enjoy what should he enjoyed by the learned are
struck by famine and other dangers.’

*Atri-saṃhitā* (152).—‘What is given to an unqualified recipient
destroys the family up to the seventh generation; neither the Gods nor
the Pitṛs accept such offerings.’

*Bṛhaspati* (59).—‘If an illiterate person accepts the gift of the cow
or gold or clothing or land or sesamum, he becomes burnt like fuel; if a
man has an illiterate person at home and the learned man at a distance,
the present should he made to the learned; the supersession of the
illiterate is not wrong.’

Even though it is the *śrāddha* that forms the subject-matter of the
present context, yet the present verse describes the evil results
occurring to the eater; it is to this effect that it has been declared
that ‘for this reason should the ignorant person fear the acceptance of
gifts from this and that person.’

‘*Spikes and spears*’ are the names of particular weapons. Such a person
is made by the attendants of the Lord of Death to eat red-hot
iron-balls.

According to Vyāsa’s view, the evil result accrues to the person
offering the focal, and not to the eater, nor to the ancestors. Because
it cannot be right to connect the dead ancestors with the evil arising
from the disobeying, by another person, of the prohibition (of the
feeding ignorant persons); as in that case, there would be the absurdity
of a man suffering what he has not earned. If an ignorant person has
been fed by the *son*, what fault is there of his dead ancestors?

“But by this same reasoning the benefit also of the *śrāddha* should not
accrue to the ancestors.”

It would certainly not accrue to them, if the śrāddha-offering had not
been distinctly enjoined as being for their benefit. In the present case
(of feeding Brāhmaṇas), however, there is no such injunction as that
‘this should be done by one who desires to confer a benefit on one’s
son,’ as there is in the case of the *Śyena* sacrifice. Then, as regards
the words of the present text, they can fit in also with the person
ottering the food; the construction in this case being—‘that man, at
whose performance of the *śrāddha* such a person eats, obtains such and
such a result.’ What forms the subject-matter of the present context is
the prohibition of the feeding of ignorant persons; and the disregarding
of this prohibition would render the rite defective; and this defect in
the Kite would lead to the evil result that the man would no longer be
entitled to the performance of that rite \[aud this would pertain to the
*giver*, not *eater*, of the food\]; and since the ancestors derive
benefit from the *śrāddha*, for this reason also the transgressing of
its injunction should involve guilt on the part of the son.

“What are the precise words of Vyāsa (on this subject)?”

\[They are\]—‘As many mouthfuls as an ignorant person swallows out of a
man’s offerings, so many spikes does he swallow on going to the abode of
Death.’

In place of ‘*preto*’ some people read ‘*pretya*;’ where also the term
‘having died’ pertains to the *eater*; and the sense of the text is that
‘the ignorant mail shall not eat of the offerings made to gods and
ancestors.’—(133)

According to Nārāyaṇa the punishment here mentioned falls on the
*eater*.—Medhātithi mentions both explanations.

For ‘*guḍān*’ Nandana reads ‘*hulān*’ and explains it as ‘double-edged
sword.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 449), which explains ‘*śūlam*’
and ‘*ṛṣti*’ as particular weapons,—and ‘*ayoguḍa*’ as ‘an
iron-ball’;—and *in Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 401).

a had Brāhmaṇa.’

*Vyāsa*.—‘As many morsels the man ignorant of the Veda swallows out of
the offerings made by a man so many darts does he swallow in the abode
of Death.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 449).—‘Those countries where what should be
eaten by the learned is eaten by the illiterate are beset by drought and
great dangers beset them.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘Even those born of noble families and endowed with
learning,—if they be of base conduct and addicted to wicked deeds,—they
are even regarded as demons. Those addicted to the killing of birds,
fish and deer, serpents and tortoise and other animals are all *Bad
Brāhmaṇas*. Who serves a Śūdra, who is supported by the King, the
village-sacrificer, those living by killing and capturing—these six are
*Low Brāhmaṇas*.’

The text proceeds to divide the qualities of men, for the purpose of
indicating the superiority of learning; and this also tor the purpose of
pointing out the propriety of making gifts to the learned.

Persons possessing excellence in ‘learning’—knowledge—are said to ‘excel
in learning,’—*i.e*., devoted to learning.

The sense desired to be conveyed justifies the Bahuvrīhi compound even
between non-appositional terms. Persons, who have studied the Veda and
its meaning and are always intent upon it, are said to ‘*excel in
learning*.’

This same explanation applies to all the terms ending with the term
‘*niṣṭhā*.’

The compound ‘*tapassvādhyāyaniṣṭhāḥ*’ is *Bahuvrīhi*, containing within
itself a copulative compound. ‘*Austerities*’—such as the *Cāndrāyaṇa*,
and the rest;—‘*vedic study*,’ is learning of the Veda.

‘*Rites*’ —*Agnihotra*, and the rest.

It has to be borne in mind that all these qualities are meant to coexist
together; the presence of any one of them only, in the absence of the
others, does not make a man a fit recipient of the gift; all that the
text describes is the fact of some men excelling in one and some in
another. That such is the meaning is indicated by the fact that the term
‘*niṣṭhā*,’ which denotes *finishing*, is indirectly indicative of
*excelling*; and when a person excels in, is intent upon, some one
quality, he is said to ‘excel’ in that. When a man is possessed of all
the good qualities, but one of those is possessed in a superior degree,
and the others in lesser degree, then also the man is a fit recipient;
but if he does not possess anyone quality in a superior degree, even
though he may possess all the qualities, he is not a fit recipient.

That a combination of all the qualities is necessary, is shown by what
has been said in the second discourse to the effect that ‘one who is
devoid of learning cannot rightly perform any rites.’

Others have explained the term ‘*jñānaniṣṭha*’ to mean the *Renunciate*,
on the ground that ‘devotion to self-knowledge’ has been specially
prescribed for him after he has renounced the performance of all rites;
(under this explanation) the term ‘*taponiṣṭha*’ would stand for *the
Recluse*; he being called ‘*tāpasa*’ ( devoted to austerities); as in
such assertions as ‘during the summer the Recluse should perform the
five austerities’ (6. 23);—and the term ‘*tapaḥsvādhyāyaniṣṭha*’ would
stand for the *Student*;—and ‘*karmaniṣṭha*’ for the *Householder*.
According to this explanation, the persons whose feeding is prohibited
are those that are outside the pale of the four ‘stages;’ say the
Paurāṇikas—‘the Śrāddha should not be offered to persons outside the
pale of the four stages.’—(134)

*Vaśiṣṭha* (6.24-25).—‘Some recipients excel in the Veda, some in
austerities; the best of recipients is one who never has had in his
stomach any food given by a Śūdra. That man is called a *Recipient* who
is given to Vedic studies, born of a noble family, quiet, devoted to
sacrificial performances, afraid of sin, fully learned, respectful
towards women, virtuous, protector of the cow, and tolerant through
austerities.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (73.9-13).—‘Purified by sacred places; purified by
sacrifices; purified by austerities; purified by truth; purified by
mantras.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.121).—‘Celibates, maintaining the five fires, firm in
the performance of their duties, devoted to austerities, and devoted to
parents,—such Brāhmaṇas are con ducive to the success of the Śrāddha.’

*Mahābharata* (13.90.50).—\[Mentions

The author now proceeds to show the purpose why he has provided a
classification of the qualities.

Offerings made to the Pitṛs are called ‘*Kavya*;’ these should be
‘*presented*’—given—‘*to those excelling in learning*.’

‘*Carefully*’—implies that if one does not take special care, these
also, like the offering to gods, should be given to all the four.

For the offerings to Pitṛs the best recipients are those excelling in
learning,—it having been declared that ‘he is the recipient among
recipients.’

What the verse means is that food in general should be given to all the
four, without any distinction.

‘*Law*’— Rule laid down in the scriptures.—(135)

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.7.4, 22).—‘One shall feed such Brāhmaṇas as
are well versed in the Veda; also one who is studying the Veda, the son
of an expounder of the Veda, and one learned in the Veda; when these eat
at a Śrāddha, they purify the line of feeders.’

*Gautama* (15.9, 10).—‘Vedic scholars, endowed with beauty, age and
character; the first offer should be made to the younger men.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 219).—‘One who is foremost in all the Vedas, one
learned in the Veda, the young man knowing Brahman, one who knows the
meaning of the Veda, the *Jyeṣṭhasāman*, the *Trimadhu* and the
*Trisuparṇaka*.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (83, 19, 21).—‘Specially the Yogins. May such a one bo
born in our family as may feed at the Śrāddha the Brāhmaṇa who is a
Yogin! By that would we be fully satisfied.’

Having raised the question as to which is superior of the two—one whose
father is illiterate, but he himself is ‘*thoroughly versed in the
Veda*,’ *i.e*., who has read the Veda along with the subsidiary
sciences,—and the other whose father is thoroughly versed in the Veda,
but he himself is illiterate,—the author now sets forth the established
conclusion.

‘*Of these two*’—between one who is himself learned in the Veda, but his
father is illiterate, and one who is himself illiterate, but his father
is learned in the Veda—one should know him to be ‘superior’—more
praiseworthy—who is himself illiterate, but his father is learned in the
Veda.

‘*The other...... for the sake of the veneration due to the Veda*’—He is
to be honoured, not because he is a Brāhmaṇa, but because he has learnt
the Vedic Mantras, which have to be honoured; and since the honouring of
the Veda has not been prescribed in connection with *Śrāddhas*, such a
person does not deserve to be fed at these.

What the author does by means of these two verses, propounding us they
do a question and its answer, is to indicate, through a laudatory
description, that what entitles a man to eat at *Śrāddhas* is the fact
of his father being learned in the Veda, and that of himself being
learned in the Veda (the two combined). The mere fact of he himself
being learned in the Veda, does not entitle him to *the eating, nor the
fact of his father being learned in* the Veda, while he himself is
illiterate.

It is with reference to this that it has been said above (in 130) that
‘one should examine the Brāhmaṇa from far off etc.;’ and the examination
of ‘*learning*’ there mentioned refers to enquiries concerning the
learning of both father and son; while those relating to *caste* and
*qualif* *ications*, these have to be extended to higher ancestors also.
And since it is this distinction that is sought to be brought out in
this verse, it cannot be regarded as a needless repetition.—(137)

Even when endowed with the aforesaid qualifications of ‘Vedic learning’
and the rest, the man shall not be fed on account of his being a friend;
this is the prohibition contained in this verse.

‘*A* *friend*’—one whose happiness and unhappiness are the same as one’s
own, and who is in no way different from himself,—‘*one should not feed
at a Śrāddha*.’

‘*By means of riches*’— by means of other kinds of gifts—‘the
acquisition’ of the friend should be made; his friendship obtained; or
the benefit of ‘friendship’ may consist in *non-separation*.

It is not only the friend that one shall not feed; the enemy also should
not be fed. ‘*Him whom he regards neither as friend* *nor* *as foe*,’—
towards whom one eutertains feelings of neither affection, nor aversion:
in regard to whom there could be no suspicion of any relationship due to
affection or any other motive; the mention of the ‘friend or foe’ being
only illustrative. It is on account of the suspicion of such
relationship that the maternal grandfather and others have been
mentioned (in 147, 148 below) as secondary alternatives.

“There is possibility of the enemy being fed only where one wishes make
a friend of him; hence he also being included under ‘friend’ (should not
have been mentioned separately).”

The separate mention is expected to make the matter dearer.—(138)

This verse supplies the commendatory supplement to the foregoing
prohibition.

The term ‘*friend*’ is used here in the abstract sense; hence the
meaning is ‘in which friendship enters as the prime consideration.’ And
this includes both friend and foe.

The term ‘*sacrifice’ stands* for (1) gifts given with reference to gods
and (2) the feeding of Brāhmaṇas with a view to some transcendental
result.

‘*Pretya phalam nāsti*’ (‘after death there is no reward’)—

“No construction is possible of this clause; since the nominative of the
root ‘*pra + iṇ*’ (of the act of *dying* denoted by the word ‘*pretya*’)
is the person performing the *śrāddha*, whereas of the verb ‘*na* +
*asti*’ (‘is not’) the nominative is ‘*phala*,’ ‘reward’ \[and as a
rule, the nominative of the participle ‘*pretya*’ and the finite verb
‘*nāsti*’ should be one and the same\].”

In answer to this, some people explain that the term ‘*pretya*’ is an
independent word, an indeclinable noun, denoting *the other world* \[and
is not a participle at all\]. Another explanation is that of the root
*pra* + *in* also ‘reward’ is the nominative; the meaning of the
participle in this case being ‘*even though arriving near*,’ ‘it does
not come about,’—*i.e*., it fails to be enjoyed.—(139)

reach neither the gods nor the Pitṛs.’ *Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana,

to form the predominant factor, then neither the gods nor the Pitṛs are

‘*Friendships*’—friendly relations—he ‘*who make*’ ‘*by means of
Śrāddhas*’ ‘*through folly*—*i.e*., being ignorant of what is contained
in the scriptures,—*falls from heaven*,’—*i.e*., never reaches heaven;
the root ‘fall’ being used in the sense of *want of connection* in
general; the sense being ‘just as a man on reaching heaven and falling
from there loses all connection with it, so this man also.’ What is
meant is that the man does not obtain the reward for performing the
*śrāddha*. in this sense alone can the passage have any connection with
all that has gone in the present context.

‘*Having the. śrāddha for his friend*;’—the *śrāddha* is spoken of as
his friend, on account of its being the means of his acquiring a friend,
it is in this sense that we have the Bahuvrīhi compound in
‘*śrāddhamitra*.’

‘*The meanest of twice-born men*;’—the ‘twice-born men’ have been
mentioned only by way of illustration; in reality, the *Śūdra* also
should not feed friends at *śrādḍhas*.

“The mere fact of the Śūdra being a *non-Brāhmaṇa* makes it impossible
for him to feed a friend at *śrāddhas* (where only Brāhmaṇas are fed).”

But who has laid down the rule that Brāhmaṇas cannot be the friends of
Śūdras?

“As a matter of fact, it is only persons of the same caste that are
regarded as *friends*; so that there could be no friendship between
persons, one of whom belongs to the higher and the other to the lower
caste.”

This also is not true; since Śvetaketu, the son of Aruṇi, is declared to
have said—‘In the Pañcāla country, there is a *Kṣatriya* friend of
mine.’

Then again, it has already been explained that the term ‘friend’ in the
present context has been used as connoting *relationship* in general.
And Brāhmaṇas also come to have pecuniary relations with *Śūdras*; and
to the *Pāraśavaśūdra* (the Śūdra born of a Brāhmaṇa father and a
*Śūdra* mother), Brāhmaṇas hear even blood-relationships.—(140)

The particle ‘*sam*’ (in ‘*Sambhojanī*) connotes *convivility*; and the
term ‘*sambhojanī*’ means that at which men dine together; such
convivial dinner is possible only among friends. Or, the word
‘*sambhojamī*’ may be taken as standing for a social dinner of several
people.

The making of friendships by Śrāddhas is a custom with ‘devils,’—the
term ‘devil’ here standing for highway robbers.

This gift ‘*remains in this world alone*’—*i.e*., it is not capable of
bringing rewards in the other world; just as the blind cow, which
remains tied in a single room, so this gift also remains in this world
only,—*i.e*., the only result it brings about is the goodwill of
friends,—and it does not bring any benefit to the ancestors.

The term ‘*dakṣiṇā*’ here stands for *gift*.—(141)

That the gift that is presented to the learned person makes the *givers*
partakers of reward is only right: but what is the reward obtained by
the receivers? If it be held that they obtain some transcendental
result,—that, cannot be right: because the act of *receiving* gifts has
not been so enjoined, and also because the receiver is prompted to
accept the gift only with a view to the perceptible reward. If, on the
other hand, the reward to the *receiver* be held to be something
perceptible,—then such a reward is found to be obtained by the ignorant
person also.”

True; but what is stated here is mere praise; the sense lasing that—‘the
presenting of offerings to the learned man is so effective that the
*receiver* also comes to partake of the imperceptible reward, in
addition to the perceptible one,—what to say of the *giver*.’

‘*Alter death*’— in heaven.

‘*Here*’—the reward is in the form of fame; the man being praised by men
as doing things in exact accordance with the scriptures,

‘*According to rule*;’—this is a mere reiterative reference to the
injunction that ‘gifts should be made to persons posessing such and such
qualifications.’—(143)

The three terms—‘*thoroughly versed in the Veda*,’ ‘*who has finished
the entire recesional text*’ and ‘*who has reached the end of it*’—are
synonymous; everyone of them denotes *persons who have learnt the whole
recensional text, including the Mantra as well as the Brāhmaṇa*; not
those who have learnt either the *Mantra-text* alone or the *Brāhmaṇa-*
text alone, or only a portion of these. The name ‘*śrotriya*,’ ‘learned
in the Veda,’ is Applied, to even those who have learnt only a part of
the Veda; hence the three terms in the present verse have been used for
the purpose of excluding the mere ‘*śrotriya*.’ In regard to this
latter, it has been said (in 128) that ‘the offering should be given to
the *śrotriya*;’ the term ‘*śrotriya*’ means ‘one learned in the
*Veda*;’ and the term ‘*veda*’ denotes the entire recensional text,
including the *Mantra* and the *Brāhmaṇa*, as also a part of these.
Consequently, for the purpose of referring to one who has learnt the
*entire* ṛecensional text, the Text 1ms used the terms in question.

“It has been laid down above (134-135) that one shall feed only such
persons as belong to one or the other *stage*; and until one has learnt
the entire Vedic text, it is not possible for one to cuter upon the
state of the Householder; as it has been asserted that ‘the entire Veda
should be learnt’ (2.165).”

But even so, it would he open to one to feed the Student who has begun
to learn the Veda,—even before he has finished it. Hence all the three
synonymous terms—‘thoroughly versed in the Veda,’ ‘who has finished the
entire recensional text,’ and ‘who has reached the end of it’—indicate
that the *whole* Veda should have been learnt.

Though only one of these words would have sufficed for the purpose, yet
the Author has made use of several forms of the same expression in view
of metrical exigencies.

‘*Vedapāragah*,’ ‘*Thoroughly versed in the Veda*,’—who has *gone
through* the entire Veda.

‘*Śākhāntagaḥ*’ ‘*who has finished the entire recensional text*’— the
end of the recensional text.

‘*Samāptikaḥ*,’—‘who has reached the end of it.’

‘*Adhvaryu*,’ ‘*adherent of the Yajurveda*’—one who has studied the
Yajurveda; this term is not used here as the name of one of the
principal sacrificial priests. ‘*Ādhvargava*’ is the name given to the
act of reciting; hence the person connected with this act is called
‘*Adhvaryu*.’

‘*Chāndoga*,’ ‘*adherent of the Sāmaveda*,’—one who studies the
Sāmaveda.

In another *Smṛti*, it is the person who has learnt the ‘three
thousands’ that has been called ‘*samāptika*;’ and the term ‘thousand’
here denotes the *Sāmaveda*, by reason of its being related to a
thousand musical forms.; and one. whose learning consists of *three* of
these ‘*thousand*’ is ‘one who has learnt the three thousands;’ the
*three* forms being (I) the

‘*Tāṇḍava*’ (Texts relating to Dancing), (2) the ‘*Aukthikya*’ (Texts
relating to the *Ukthas*) and (2) the ‘*Sāmagāna*’ (the singing of Sāmu
verses); these are the three ‘sciences’ of the Sāmaveda, of which there
are a thousand recensions.

The ‘*Ṛgveda*’ stands for the Saṃhitā text of ten *Maṇḍalas* divided
into sixty-four *adhyāyas* and the Brāhmaṇa.

Others have explained this verse as excluding the adherents of the
Atharva Veda from being fed. (They argue that) if the author had
intended to include all the Vedas, he would have simply said—‘one should
feed that Brāhmaṇa who has learnt the entire recensional text of the
Veda.’

“The same argument might be urged against the verse being taken as
excluding the adherent of the Atharva Veda: if this exclusion had been
intended, the Author could have simply said—‘the adherent of the Atharva
Veda shall not be fed.’ Such a statement would be very much simpler and
a more direct way of laying down the exclusion.”

There is no force in this; as Munu’s way of teaching Dharma is diverse:
sometimes he leaves the negation to be implied by means of an
affirmation, and at others he puts the negation directly in its own
words.—(145).

Some people might argue as follows:—“It has been asserted that ‘at the
rite performed in honour of ancestors one should feed three Brāhmaṇas;’
and in the preceding verse the learners of several recensional texts
have been mentioned; so that there is no possibility of one’s own
companions in study being fed.”

And it is with a view to set aside this notion that the author puts
forward the present verse.

Of these three—the adherents of the three Vedas—anyone may be fed.

That is to say, one may feed either persons professing the same
recensional text as oneself or those professing other several texts.

‘*Duly honoured*’—worshipped, approached, with offerings of water, etc.

‘*Satisfaction to the seventh degree*’—*i.e*., the satisfaction
continues till the seventh degree of descendants. The prolonging of both
vowels in the term ‘*sāptapauruṣī*’ is in accordance with Pāṇini 7.3.20.
This epithet has been added for the purpose of indicating great length
of time; the meaning being that ‘the satisfaction of the ancestors lasts
for a long time.’ The meaning is that ‘by the feeding of the said
Brāhmaṇa, the satisfaction secured to the ancestors is such as lasts
till such time as his sons and grandsons to the seventh degree are
born.’

‘*Everlasting*,’—*i.e*., it does not cease, and then appears again; it
remains there always.—(146)

*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 337).—‘If one feeds a single Sāmavedin
at the Śrāddha, all the three Vedas, Ṛk, Sāman and Yajuṣ, are present in
him. If, for the sake of his fathers, one secures one who has pondered
over the texts of the Sāman, then he secures the entire earth along with
hills and forests. The Ṛk satisfies the father, the Yajuṣ, the
grandfather, and the Sāman, the great-grandfather;—and the Chandoga is
superior even to that.’

Beginning with verse 122, twenty-five verses have gone before; and the
upshot of them all is as follows: (*a*) Śrāddhas should be performed on
the moon-less day;—(*b*) the person fed should be learned in the Veda,
highly educated, of right behaviour, belonging to a known family, the
sou of a person learned in the Veda and not bearing any relationship to
the person offering the *Śrāddha*. The rest of it all is only
commendatory.

‘*This*’—what has been just described,—is ‘*the the first*’— the
primary—‘*course*’—procedure at *Śrāddhas*; *viz*., that, the food shall
be presented to one who is not related to the performer.

‘*This*’—what is going to be described—‘should be regarded as ‘*the
secondary course*’—which is to be adopted only in the event of the
primary course being not possible This course is called ‘*anukalpa*,’
‘secondary course,’ by the ‘law of substitutes’ (propounded in
*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra* 3.6.37 *et. seq*.).

‘*Always adopted*’— this is purely commendatory.—(147)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.220, p. 146) in support of the
view that the *sister’s son* and other similar relatives (mentioned in
the next verse, and in Yājñavalkya, 1.220) are to be fed at the
*Śrāddha* only if the above described ‘Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda’ is
not available;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 558), along with the next
verse;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha; p. 447);—in *Godādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
514), which remarks that this secondary method is put forward in view of
the fact that very few Brāhmaṇas are really fit for being fed at
Śrāddha;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 991).

*Medhātithi* (P. 250, l. 15)—‘*Pratinidhinyāyenā*.’—See *Mīmāṃsā sūtra*
3.6.37. The *Yava* having been laid down as a substitute at sacrifices
for the *Vrīhi*, the question is raised as to the necessity or otherwise
of performing all those acts in connection with the substitute which
have been laid down in connection with the original; and the conclusion
is that the substitute has to be treated exactly in the same manner as
the original.

This verse is not meant to be prohibitive o? the examination of
Brāhmaṇas (to be invited) at the rite performed in honour of the gods;
what is meant by it is the permitting, at certain times, of the feeding,
at rites in honour of gods, of such persons as are one-eyed, suffering
from elephantiasis, and so forth.

‘*At the rite in honour of the Pitṛs*’—*i,e*., when the time for
*Śrāddha* has arrived, one should do the examination with great care;
not so at the rite performed in honour of the gods. At the latter, one
may sometimes even feed those going to be mentioned. Who are those that
are permitted to be fed, we shall show later on.

According to others, however, this verse has been introduced for the
purpose of enjoining the strict exclusion of those going to be
mentioned; and not for that of permitting the feeding of those at the
rites in honour of gods.—(149)

‘*Thieves*’—stealers.

‘*Outcast*’—one who commits any one of the five ‘great sins.’

‘*Eunuch*’— emasculate, having the marks of both man and woman,
unvirile, impotent.

‘*Atheists*’—Materialists and others; those whose firm conviction is
that ‘gifts are nothing, oblations are nothing, there is no other world
the behaviour of those is unbelief; ‘those whose behaviour is like the
behaviour of atheists’ are called ‘having the behaviour of
atheists,’—this being an instance of the compound that drops its last
term. The word ‘atheist’ by itself would be sufficient; the term
‘behaviour’ has been introduced for the purpose of filling up the metre.

Or, the term ‘*nāstikavṛttayaḥ*’ may be taken to mean ‘those who derive
their livelihood from atheists.’

These Manu has declared to be undeserving of the offerings made at the
rites performed in honour of gods and Pitṛs.

The name of ‘Manu’ has been added for the purpose of lending force to
the prohibition; as, in reality, all duties have been described by
Manu.—(150)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687) among others,
enumerating persons who should not be invited at *Śrāddhas*; it adds (on
688) the notes that—the ‘thief’ meant here is one who steals the
belongings of others than the Brāhmaṇas, the stealer of the latter’s
goods being included under ‘outcastes’,——‘*nāstikavṛtti*’ is one who
derives his livelihood from one who denies that there are any rewards
for acts in the other world;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 447), which explains
the ‘*nāstika*’ as ‘one who holds the opinion that there is nothing that
is *divine*,’ and the ‘*nāstikavṛtti*’ as ‘he who makes a living by
expounding and writing on the works of such unbelievers.’

**(verses 3.150-166)  
**

*Gautama* (15.15-18).—‘One shall not feed at Śrāddha one who is a thief,
an eunuch, an out-cast, a heretic, or who behaves like a heretic, the
murderer of the hero, one whose wife dallies with another person (or who
makes love to his brother’s widow, or who has married a girl before the
marriage of her elder sister), who officiates at sacrifices performed by
women or by village communities, who keeps goats, who commits arson, who
drinks wine, who is censorious, who has perjured himself, who is a
conjuror, who permits his wife’s paramour to live in the house, who eats
the food of an adulterer’s son, who sells Soma, who has burnt a house,
who is a poisoner, who has broken the vows of continence, who is the
servant of a company, who has intercourse with women with whom
intercourse is prohibited, who is cruel, who has been superseded, in
marriage, by his younger brother, who has superseded, in marriage, his
elder brother, who is a pledgee or a pledger, who is bald-headed, or
with deformed nails or black teeth, who suffers from leucoderma, who is
the son of a remarried woman, who keeps a gambling house, who does not
repeat mantras, who is the servant of the king, the Prātirūpika (whose
profession is the assuming of disguises), who has married a Śūdra woman,
who neglects the great sacrifices, who is leprous, who makes a living by
money-lending, who trades, who makes a living by arts and crafts, or who
is addicted to playing on musical instruments or to dancing and
singing;—also those who have separated from their father against his
wish.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.15).—‘Avoiding the emaciated, one who is suffering from
leucoderma, the eunuch, the blind, one who has black teeth, the leprous
and one who has deformed nails.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.222-224).—‘The following have been deprecated: the
invalid, one deficient in his limbs, one with superfluous limbs, the
one-eyed, the son of a re-married woman, one who has broken his vows of
continence, one born of his unwidowed mother’s paramour, one born of his
widowed mother’s paramour, who has deformed nails, or black teeth, who
teaches for a stipulated fee, the eunuch, the defiler of virgins, who is
accused of sins, who injures a friend, the traitor, the Soma-seller, who
has superseded his elder brother in marriage, who has abandoned the
mother or the father or the preceptor, one who eats the food of the
adulterer’s son, the son of a Śūdra, the husband of a girl who had
another husband, the thief, one whose conduct is wicked.’

*Viṣṇu* (82.4-29).—‘Those who offer sacrifices for many persons, or for
village-communities, those who have abandoned the mother, the father,
the preceptor, the Fires or Vedic Study, temple-attendants, healers,
servants of the king, professional teachers, those taught by
professional teachers, those associating with outcasts, those whose
behaviour is cat-like (hypocritical), those who quarrel with their
father, those in the habit of performing on other days those rites that
should he performed on fixed days, informers, astrologers, those
supported by food given by Śūdras, those engaged in evil professions.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.90, 6, etc.).—‘He who has married before his elder
brother, who is suffering from skin-diseases, who violates his
preceptor’s bed; the keeper of a gambling house, one who has helped in
abortions, the consumptive, who tends cattle, who neglects the great
sacrifices, who serves the village, the usurer, the singer, who sells
all things, who has burnt houses, the poisoner, who eats the adulterer’s
food, the seller of Soma, the palmist, the servant; of the king, who
deals in oils, the forgerer, who has separated from his father, he who
permits his wife’s paramour to live in the house, who is accused of
crimes, the thief, who makes his living by arts and crafts; one who
performs on stray days ceremonies laid down as to he performed on
specified days, the back-biter, who injures his friend, the adulterer,
who teaches persons not keeping the observances, one who makes a living
by arms, who wanders about with dogs, and one who has been bitten by a
dog.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.17.21).—‘Who is suffering from leucoderma,
bald-headed, adulterer, the son of one who makes a living by arms, one
born of a Brāhmaṇa mother and a Śūdra father;—if these are fed at the
Śrāddha, they defile the line.’

*Atri-Saṃhitā* (347-348).—‘The servant, the tawny, the one-eyed, one
suffering from leucoderma, the invalid, whose skin is diseased, one
whose hair has fallen off, one suffering from jaundice, one who wears
matted locks, who carries loads, who is cruel, who has two wives, who
has a Śūdra wife, who foments quarrels and one who causes much
suffering.’

*Bṛhad- Yama-Smṛti* (35, 38).—‘Possessed of evil features, the eunuch, a
heretic, decrier of the Veda, one ever hankering after gifts, who is
addicted to begging and is engrossed in objects of sense.’

*Prajāpati-Smṛti* (84, 90).—‘The husband of a girl who has had a husband
before, the thief, whoso conduct is reprehensible,—these are to be
avoided. One’s ancestors fly away if they see a buffalo-keeper at the
Śrāddha.’

*Devala* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 689).—‘The man who makes a living for
three years by worshipping gods, is called the *Devalaka*, despised at
all offerings to Gods and Pitṛs; he is to be regarded as unfit for
company at all functions.’

*Kaśyapa* (Aparārka, p. 118).—‘Enemies, those who betray trusts, who are
deficient in limbs, astrologers,—these Brāhmaṇas should be avoided at
all functions; the one-eyed, the leprous, the eunuch, the skin-less, the
hair-less,—these should never be mixed up at Śrāddha, with those versed
in the Veda.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 119).—‘Perjuror, impotent, wife-controlled,
dam-piercer, keeper of musical time, professional actor, teacher of
false religion, professional beggar, who has incurred the liability of
expiatory rites, roguish, foolhardy, fowler, gambler, atheist,
back-biter, wicked, etc., etc.’

‘*One with braided hair*’—*i.e*., the Student; this arrangement of the
hair has been laid down as an optional alternative for him—‘he should
either shave his head or wear his hair in braids’ (2-219); the ‘braided
hair’ is mentioned here only as an indicative of the Student; hence the
present verse includes also that student who may have shaved his head.
And the student whose feeding is prohibited here is only *one who is not
studying*.

“In view of what has been said above in regard to the propriety of
feeding one who is learned in the Veda (128), there can be no
possibility of anyone feeding a man *who is not studying* (why then
should his feeding be specially prohibited?)”

The prohibition is necessary, as otherwise one might feed the student
who began his study, but did not carry it on and did not learn the Veda.

“But it has been said above (145) that one should feed him who is
‘*thoroughly versed in the Veda*;’ where, then, could there be any
possibility of the admission of one who had only made a beginning of
study?”

In that case, we shall take the prohibition as applying to that student
who may have read through the Veda, without having made it all his own.

Or, the phrase ‘*who is not learned*’ may be taken as added to guard
against the contingency that, on the strength of what is said (in 3,
234) regarding the propriety of feeding the daughter’s son, even though
he he still in the state of studentship, some people might be led to
think the only necessary qualification consisted in the person invited
being the ‘daughter’s son,’ and ‘learning’ was not an essential
condition at all. And when the student¹ who is not studying’ becomes
precluded, it naturally follows that the student who is studying is
entitled to be fed.

‘*Durrāla*;’—this term may mean either one whose hair have fallen off,
or one who is red-haired, or one who is without hair in his private
parts. In this sense, they explain the etymology of the word as
follows:—‘mere grass suffices for his clothing, he is covered by mere
grass, having no clothing, ho hides his private parts with mere grass,’

^(‘)*Gambler*’— who is addicted to gambling.

^(‘)*Who* *sacrifice* *for hosts*’— for groups of men. The collective
performance of the I *Vrātyastoma* for a number of *Vrātyas* has been
prescribed: and officiating at such sacrifices has been prohibited under
II. 197.

Our explanation, however, is that the phrase applies to one who may
sacrifice, even by turns, for many persons:—*i.e*., who undertakes
service as priest very frequently:—such a person also shall not be fed.
Says Vaśiṣṭha—‘He who sacrifices for many men, and he who initiates many
persons.’

Some people hold that, since the present verse specifies
the^(‘)*Śrāddha*,’ the interdict herein contained pertains only to rites
in honour of the Pitṛs, not to those in honour of the gods.

This, however, is not right. Because the rites in honour of the gods
(*Viśvedevas*) are also a part of the ‘*Śrāddha*,’ which latter term
therefore can be used in connection with these also.—(151)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which adds
(on p. 688) the notes that—‘*Jaṭila*’ means the

Student, who is qualified by the adjective ‘*anadhīyānaḥ*’, so that the
person precluded is the Student *who is not reading*,—one who is reading
being regarded as fit to be invited, the unreading Student could not be
included under the term ‘not learned in the Veda,’ as there is every
likelihood of people falling into the mistake that even though not
reading, the Student deserves to be invited;—the ‘*Durvāla*’ is one who
is ‘bald’, or ‘tawny-haired’;—the ‘*Kitava*’ is ‘one addicted to
gambling’;—the ‘*Pūgayājaka*’ is ‘one who sacrifices for hosts.’—It goes
on to add that the addition of the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ indicates that the
persons here enumerated are to be excluded from invitation only at
Śrāddhas, and not from the rites performed in honour of the gods;
otherwise the addition would be superfluous.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 450), which explains ‘*jaṭilam*’ as ‘the
*Brahmacārī*,’ and ‘*durbāla*’ as ‘*khalatiḥ*;’—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 480);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a).

‘*Jaṭilam ca anadhīyānam*’—Medhātithi takes ‘*anadhīyānam*’ as
qualifying ‘*jaṭilam*’, explaining the two together as ‘the Student who
is not learned; *i.e*., who began the study, hut did not complete
it’;—Kullūka also takes the two together; but explains ‘*anadhīyānam*’
as ‘one who has only had his Upanayana performed, but has not been
taught the Veda’; and adds that ‘this implies that one may invite that
Student *who is still studying the Veda*, though he may not have
mastered it.’

‘*Healers* physicians.

^(‘)*Temple-attendants*’—those who attend upon idols.

These two are prohibited only as means of living. Healing and serving
idols, when done entirely with a righteous motive (and not as a means of
living), are not reprehensible.

‘*Meat-sellers*’—Butchers.

If we read these words with the Accusative ending, then they have to be
construed with the verb of the preceding verse.

‘*Those living by trade*’—*i.e*., by improper trade; improper
merchandise shall be described under Discourse 10,—those who live by
such trade.

‘*Should be avoided*’—at both kinds of rites.

Meat-selling is reprehensible, even when done with a *righteous* motive.
For instance, when one man has *got* meat and another man has need for
it;—the former man who has got the meat stands in need *of* butter for
oblations; *and he exchanges his* meat with the other man’s butter;
*this exchange is done* ‘with a righteous motive,’ and *exchange also is
called* ‘selling;’ *hence* those also *become* excluded who do such
meat-selling, even with a righteous motive.—(152)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which omits
the second half of this and the whole of the next verse, though
continuing with verse 154;—the whole verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 560);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 480).

*Parāśaramādhava* (on p. 689) adds the notes that the ‘*chikitsaka*’ is
‘one who administers medicine either gratuitously or by way of
living,’—this work being specially forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa,—the
‘*Devalaka*’ is ‘one who, for three years, worships the gods as a means
of making money,’ such being the definition provided by a text quoted
from Devala,—the ‘*Māṃsavikrayī*’ intended to be excluded is one who
sells meat, *even in abnormal times of distress*,—because as regards
*normal times*, living by any kind of trade is forbidden by the next
phrase, which prohibition does not apply to abnormal times, during which
the ‘livelihood of the Vaiśya’ has been permitted for the Brāhmaṇa.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 450), which explains that the
‘*Chikitsaka*’ means one who makes a living by administering medicines,
not one who does it by way of charity;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
40).

‘*Servant*’—one who carries out orders: one who is sent by the
village-people hither and thither, on business.

Similarly, ‘*the servant of the king*,’ ‘*one who hew deformed nail*,’
‘*one who has black teeth*.’

‘*Opposer of his teacher*’— he who, in conversation and other things,
remains against and in opposition to his superior.

‘*One who has forsaken the Fire*’—*i.e*., out of the Three Fires and the
Domestic Fire, one who has given up even one,

‘*Usurer*’—one who, even though he has other menus of living available,
lives upon interest. Though ‘Usury’ has been defined as ‘the
accumulating *of grains* by interest,’ yet this definition can be
accepted as authoritative only within the limited scope of the subject
dealt with by the Smṛti in which it occurs; in fact, grammarians apply
the term ‘usurer’ to persons making a living by interest, in connection
with things other than grains also: and, in the matter of words and
their meanings, grammarians are more authoritative than others; because
they make these the subject of careful study.—(153)

The term ‘*yakṣmī*’ stands here for the *invalid* in general. Some peope
take it as standing for *one suffering from consumption*.

‘*Cattle-tender*’— he who, stick in hand, tends cattle as a profession.

‘*Nirākṛti*,’ ‘*who neglects the Great Sacrifices*,’—one who, though
entitled to perform the Great Sacrifices, fails, to perform them. Even
now-a-days, one who fails to perform the Great Sacrifices, and is, on
that account, regarded as incapable of being served,’ is called
‘*Nirākṛti*.’ Thus we read in the *Śatapatha*—‘ one who worships neither
gods, nor ancestors nor men.’

Some people quote the definition that—‘the man devoid of Vedic study,
learning and wealth is called *Nirākṛti*;’ but these people are ignorant
of the right meaning of words; because the person mentioned in this
definition can have no connection with the present context, which deals
exclusively with ‘persons learned in the Veda.’ If the term ‘*Nirākṛti*’
is taken iii the sense of ‘the derider, *Nirākartā*, of gods, etc.,’
then there is. some compatibility with the literal signification of the
root; and even though the term ends with the abstract affix, ‘*ktin*,’
and as such is an abstract noun denoting a *quality*, yet its use in the
sense of the person having that quality may be justified on the
principle that there is no difference between the *quality* and *one
possessing the quality*.

Then again, the root in the term ‘*Nirākṛti*,’ when preceded by ‘*ni*,’
signifies *exclusion*: people who are excluded are said to be
‘*Nirākṛta*;’ as we find in such expressions as ‘*Nirākṛta*, excluded,
from dinner,’ ‘*Nirākṛta*, excluded, from title,’ and so forth. Thus
*non-exclusion* would be ‘*ākrti*,’ ‘invitation;’ and one from whom this
has been set aside, would be ‘*Nirākṛti*.’

Further, ‘*ākṛti*’ also means *configuration*; the prefix ‘*ni*’ having
the sense of *reprehensibilty*, the term may be taken as excluding the
ill-figured person. It has been declared that (one should feed) ‘one who
is endowed with speech, beauty, age and diameter:’ here ‘endowed with
speech’ means *eloquent, of powerful speech*; but the man who is
garrulous should not be fed; ‘*endowed with beauty*’ means *having a
beautiful body and limbs*; ‘endowed with age’ means what Gautama (15.10)
has said in regard to ‘the feeding of older men before youths,’

Lastly, the term ‘*Nirākṛti*’ may be taken as ending in ‘*ktich*,’ and
being a proper name,

‘*One who is inimical to Brahman*’—one who hates Brāhmaṇas, or the Veda;
the term ‘*Brahman*’ denoting both (Brāhmaṇa and Veda); when, for
instance, it is said that ‘the Brāhmaṇa also is called *Brahman*.’

‘*Company*’—corporation; those, who subsist conjointly upon one means of
livelihood, are spoken of by the name ‘com *pany*;’ and those Brāhmaṇas
who are members of such a company.

‘*One who has superseded his elder brother*’ and ‘*one who has been
superseded by his younger brother*’—these are going to be described
later on.—(154)

‘*Yakṣmī*’—‘Invalid in general, or (according to ‘others’) one suffering
from consumption’ (Medhātithi, who has favoured the latter explanation
on p. 159 of the text).

‘*Nirākṛtiḥ*’—‘One who omits the Great Sacrifices, even though entitled
to their performance’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘one who
forsakes the Vedas’ (Govindarāja);—‘one who does not recite the Veda, or
has forgotten it’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Gaṇābhyantaraḥ*’—‘A member of a corporation of men subsisting
conjointly upon one means of livelihood’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘the headman of a village, or leader of a caravan’ (added by
Nārāyaṇa);—‘one who misappropriates the money of a corporation’ (Kullūka
and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 560), which explains
‘*paśupālaḥ*’ as ‘one who tends cattle as a means of
living’,—‘*Nirākṛtiḥ*’ as ‘atheist,’—and ‘*gaṇābhyantaraḥ*’ as ‘a
Brāhmaṇa who is a member of a *Maṭha*, a religious corporation.’

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which adds (on p. 690) the following
notes:—The ‘*yakṣmī*’ is the ‘consumptive’;—the ‘cattle-tender’ meant to
be excluded is one who does the work even in normal times,—the
‘*parivettā*’ is the younger brother who takes a wife or sets up the
fire, before his elder brother; and ‘*Parivitti*’ is the elder brother
thus superseded,—the ‘elder brother’ here meant being the ‘uterine
brother’, as there is nothing wrong in the ‘superseding’ of other kinds
of brothers; though, under certain circumstances, the ‘superseding’ of
the elder uterine brother also is not considered wrong; *e*. *g*., when
the brother happens to be impotent, or away in foreign lands, or become
an outcaste, or turn an ascetic, or entirely given to yogic practices,
and as such has renounced the world, and so forth;—the ‘*nirākṛti*’ is
one who, having read the Veda, has forgotten it’;—and the
‘*gaṇābhyantara*’ is ‘one who is a member of a group of men belonging to
various castes and engaged in uncertain ways of living.’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains ‘*yakṣmī*’ as ‘one
suffering from consumption’ and ‘*nirākṛtiḥ*’ as ‘one who does not
perform the Five Daily Sacrifices,’—and ‘*gaṇābhyantaraḥ*’ as ‘one who
makes a living by a temple dedicated to the public.’

Bards, dramatic performers, dancers and singers are called ‘actors.’

‘*One who has broken the vows of continence*’—necessary for the student.

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ stands for the *śūdra* woman; her ‘*husband*.’
People think that this refers to a case where there is no other wife;
the meaning being ‘he who is the husband of the Śūdra woman alone, he
who has no wife of any twice-born caste.’

“Whence is this sense got at?”

In another connection, we find a recapitulation of reprehensible
practices, where we read—‘these are men addicted to reprehensible
practices’ (167); the mere marrying of a *Śūdra* woman, which is
sanctioned by all, is not ‘reprehensible;’ but it has been sanctioned
only for one who has already married a wife of the same caste as
himself. Hence, what is excluded here is that husband of the Śūdra woman
who has no wife of the same caste as himself.

‘*The son of a re-married woman*;’—‘*punarbhūḥ*’ is the remarried woman;
described under Discourse 9, in the verse ‘she who has been abandoned by
her husband, etc.’ (9.175).

‘*Who has only one eye*’—whose one eye is maimed.

‘*He in whose house lives the paramour*,’—*i.e*., the paramour of his
lawfully wedded wife. Such a man is despised by reason of his tolerating
such a thing. It is said below (8.317)—‘The abortionist transmits bis
guilt to him who feeds him, and the misbehaved wife transmits hers to
her husband.’—(155)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which (on p.
693) adds the following notes:—‘*Kuśīlava*’ stands for ‘singers and
others,’—‘*Vṛṣalīpati*’ is ‘the husband of a girl who attained puberty
before marriage;’—that person also is to be excluded in whose house a
paramour of his wife’s lives constantly;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
481);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains ‘*Kuśīlavaḥ*’
as ‘dancer’.

‘*One who teaches for a stipulated fee*’— one who teaches only while be
is engaged on a fee; one who undertakes the work of teaching after
having made the stipulation that ‘if you pay me so much, I shall teach
you the Veda,’ is called ‘one who teaches for a stipulated fee.’ Such is
the form of payment known among bearers and others. If, however, without
having verbally stipulated that one would receive a certain amount of
money, one does the work of teaching and receives payment afterwards,
then such a teacher is not ‘one who teaches for a stipulated fee.’ In
fact, teaching in return for payment of an amount not previously
stipulated, has been actually sanctioned.

Similarly, ‘*one who is taught by one who teaches for a stipulated
fee*;’ this is the name given to one who *himself*, like Satyakāma, pays
a stipulated fee and then reads with the teacher. The boy, however, who,
in the absence of any other teacher, is put by his father and others
under the tuition of one who is paid a stipulated fee, is not regarded
as ‘of reprehensible practice.’ Because it is for the father to save the
boy from all that is prohibited. It has been declared (in 8.317)—‘The
pupil and the sacrificer transmit their guilt to the Teacher.’

‘*The pupil of a Śūdra*’— in the learning of Grammar and other Sciences.

‘*Teacher*’—of the Śūdra, Though the term ‘*śūdra*,’ forms the
subordinate factor in the compound ‘*śūdraśiṣya*,’ yet it is construed
with the following word; such construction being permissible in works on
*Smṛti*. Then again, the condition of being ‘reprehensible practice’ is
a qualification that governs all that is said here, and it is only the
teaching of the Śūdra. that is reprehensible, not the teaching of any
other higher caste.

‘*Reprehensible in speech*’—*i.e*., rude and untruthful of speech.
Others explain this to mean ‘one who is accused of a serious offence.’

‘*The son of an adulteress and the son of a widow*’—to be described
later on (174),—(156).

He who, in the absence of any cause, forsakes his Mother, Father and
Preceptor. The term ‘*guru*,’ ‘superior’ here being used in its general
sense, includes the Teacher also.

Some people argue that—“in that case (if ‘guru ’ *stands* for the
*superior* in general), the Father and the Mother need not have been
mentioned, these also being included under the term ‘*guru*; for this
reason, this term ‘*guru*’ should be taken as standing for the Preceptor
only.”

This, however, is not right. If the ‘father’ and ‘mother’ wore not
specifically mentioned, then the term ‘superior’ would stand for the
father only, by the law of the ‘natural and artificial’ \[*i.e*., where
both are possible, the *natural* one is to be given the preference, and
the Father is the *natural* superior, while the Teacher is only an
*artificial* one\]. When, however, these two are mentioned separately,
then it becomes clear that the term ‘superior’ has been used in its most
general sense; specially in view of what other scriptures have said
regarding the Teacher being ‘the best of superiors.’

Reasons for forsaking these superiors are such as are mentioned in the
text—‘one should forsake one’s father, if one has injured the king,’ and
so forth.

The ‘forsaking’ of one’s parents means omitting to wash and shampoo
their feet and to do such other services, *i.e*., being inattentive to
their service. Similarly, with the Teacher, in whose case going for
study to another teacher, while one’s teacher is capable of teaching
one, also constitutes ‘forsaking.’

‘*Who has formed connection with outcasts’—i.e*., established
relationship with them.

‘*Through the Veda’—i.e*., by officiating at their sacrifices, by
teaching them, and so forth.

‘*Through marriage*,’—*i.e*., by giving his daughter in marriage to
them, and so forth.

“The man who forms such connection, would himself become an outcast; and
it would he as an outcast himself that he would be avoided at rites.”

In answer to this, some people say, in view of what is said below (290)
regarding a man becoming an¹ outcast’ by associating with outcasts *for
one gear*, that the present prohibition should be taken as pertaining to
the time before the lapse of the twelve months.

“What is this peculiar form of expression—*formed a connection through
relationship*?’”

As a matter of fact, the term ‘*samyoga*,’ ‘*connection*’ is not used
here in the sense of ‘conjunction,’ according to the usage of the
*Vaiśeṣikas*; it is the *act* itself that is called ‘connection,’ by
reason of its being the *cause* of connection. In connection with the
acts of ‘officiating at sacrifices’ and the like, the term ‘connection’
indicates and stands for mere relationship in general.—(157)

‘*Guroḥ*’—‘The *Upādhyāya*’, Sub-teacher (Medhātithi);—‘the *Ācārya*
Teacher (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which (on p.
693) adds that the person meant to be excluded by the second half of the
verse is the person who contracts the said alliances with one
*associating with a person who has committed a heinous crime*,—and not
with the latter person himself, as such a relation of the ‘heinous
criminal’ would be an ‘outcaste’ himself, and hence liable to be
excluded as such;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a).

The burner of houses.

‘*Garada*’—one who gives to others the *gara-poison*; the mention of
‘*gara*’ is merely indicative; it includes all kinds of poison.

He who eats the food of the adulteress’ son; similarly, he who eats the
food of the widow’s son; the former being meant to be purely indicative.

He who sells Soma; ‘Soma’ is a particular kind of *herb*; he who sells
this *herb*, for use either at sacrifices or for medicine.

Others have explained the term ‘Soma’ (in the expression ‘seller of
Soma’) to mean the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other sacrifices performed with the
Soma. Though the actual ‘selling’of these sacrifices is not
possible,—because an *act* is purely incorporeal,—yet, as a matter of
fact, the practice of ‘selling’ sacrifices is found to be current among
illiterate people; hence the present prohibition. Illiterate people are
found making such assertions in oath as—(*a*) ‘whatever good I have
done, may be yours’ (where they mean to transfer the merit acquired by
their good deeds), and (*b*) ‘that night in which you were born and that
in which you are dying, leaving these two, all your charities and
performances, all your good deeds, your life and offspring I might
destroy, if they injure me’ (An oath). And just as they make use of such
oaths, so also they practice the *Giving* and *Selling* (of acts) by
means of words; and he who does this, is avoided (at *Śrāddha*
-feedings). It is from this that we infer the impropriety of uttering
such oaths and the doing of such verbal givings and sellings.

‘*Sea-voyager*’—one who goes out to the sea.

He who quarrels with his father; *i.e*., talks rudely to him; and goes
to court against him as party to a suit instituted for partition. Says
Gautama (15-19)—‘Those who separate from their Father, without reason.’

Why should this be asserted here, which appears to be a repetition of
what has been mentioned above (153) as the ‘opposer of his Teacher’?”

*Opposing* is one thing, and *quarrelling* is something different. When
the superior wants a certain thing, if one were to say rudely, ‘How can
this be got!,’—this is ‘opposing;’ so that one is an ‘opposer, by
obstructing his acquisition of a thing that belongs to him. Further,
under 153 ‘*pratirāddhā*’ is another reading (for ‘*pratiroddhā*’),
which means ‘doing direct injury,’ *i.e*., striking the superior with
slaps, &c. And with this reading what has gone before (in 153) is
clearly different from the ‘quarrelling’ mentioned here.

‘*Keeper of a gambling house*’—the gamester who makes other people
gamble; he who is himself a gambler has been already excluded before (in
151),

Some people read ‘*Kekara*’ (for ‘*Kitava*’), reading the text as
‘*Kekaro madyapastathā*;’ and ‘*Kekara*’ is the man with a squint.

Others, again, read ‘*Kātara*,’ which means ‘one, the pupils in whose
eyes are like the parrot’s feather, green.’

‘*Drunkard*’—one who drinks wines of kinds other than the ‘*Surā*’ (wine
distilled from grains); such, for instance, as the ‘*Ariṣṭa*,’ and the
like;—the drinker of ‘*Surā*’ being already precluded as an ‘outcast.’

‘*One afflicted with a fold disease*’—*i.e*., the leper; he being very
much despised among people, it is only right that he should be spoken of
as ‘afflicted with a foul disease.’

It is on account of the present prohibition that the term *yakṣmi* (in
154) has been taken (by some people) not as the ‘invalid’ in general,
but one who is suffering from consumption; if the ‘invalid’ in general
were meant, then all invalids being included there, the author would not
have mentioned ‘one afflicted with a foul disease’ in this verse.

‘*Accused of sins*.’—one who is known among people as having committed
sins, great and small; even without its being known for a certain.

‘*Hypocrite*.’—one who deceitfully performs religious acts, with a view
to gaining popularity, not because he thinks it his duty to do so.

‘*Dealer in essence*.’—*i.e*., the seller of poison; it is poison that
is called ‘Essence.’ In several places, we find the *poisoner* spoken of
as ‘*rasadaḥ*’ ‘giver of *essence*—(159)

‘*Kitavaḥ*’—‘The keeper of a gambling house’ (Medhātithi);—‘one who
makes others play for himself’ (Govinda-

Medhātithi and Kullūka note the other reading ‘*Keka* *raḥ*’, explaining
it as ‘squint-eyed’, and connecting it with the ‘drunkard.’

*The translation on p. 183, ll. 1-3 should run as follows, and not as
printed*:—“*Some people read* ‘*Kekaraḥ*’ for ‘*kitavaḥ*’ *and make it
qualify* ‘*madyapaḥ*’; *the* ‘*kekara*’ *is* ‘*the man with a squint*’.

‘*Kātaraḥ*’ is yet another reading noted by Medhātithi, who explains it
as ‘one, the pupils in whose eyes are like the parrot’s feather, green’.

‘*Rasavikrayī*’—‘One who sells poison’ (Medhātithi);—‘one who sells
substances used for flavouring food, *e.g*., sugarcane-juice and the
like’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the seller of molasses’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 087), which reads
‘*Kekaraḥ*’ and explains it as ‘squint-eyed’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
481);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha p. 9);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*
(p. 40), which explains ‘*kitavaḥ*’ as ‘gambler’, and ‘*rasavikrayī*’ as
‘dealer in salt and such other articles’.

He who, as a professional artisan, makes bows and arrows.

‘*Agredidhiṣūpatiḥ*;’—the term ‘*didhiṣū*’ is connected both ways, like
the single eye-ball of the crow operating in both sockets. Such a
construction is permissible, because the text belongs to the category of
a ‘*snmṛti-śātra*.’ Even (meaningless) lines and clods of earth are made
to yield some meaning, in consideration of the requirements of *Smṛtis*;
and they come out useful too. For this reason, the objection need not be
raised as to how a single term occurring in the middle of a compound can
be construed with two different terms. In fact. Gautama (15.16) has
expressly prohibited both (The ‘*agredidhiṣū*’ and the ‘*didhiṣūpati*’),
and this indicates the plausibility of the above construction; and the
compound really contains two terms. Further, there is no such person as
‘*agredidhiṣūpati*.’ The definition of these two (‘*agredidhiṣū* and
*didhiṣūpatī*’) will he supplied later on.

‘*Who injures a friend*’—who puts obstacles in a friend’s business.

‘*Who subsists* *by gambling*’—The man for whom gambling is the means of
subsistence.

“Such a person has already been mentioned in the preceding verse.”

But the person who helps people to gamble (The ‘keeper of a gambling
house, mentioned before) is not necessarily one who makes a living by
it; in fact, it is one who himself does not know gambling, or who does
not do it through fear of his elders; hut, being addicted to it as an
amusement, he always makes others gamble; and it is for excluding this
kind of man that we had the second ‘*Kitava*’ (in the preceding verse;
the word ‘*Kitava*’ having been first included in verse 151).

Or, the term ‘*dyūtavṛtti*’ may stand for those who, without any money
themselves, are constant dummy visitors at gambling places.

He whose son is his *teacher*; it is not possible for the son to be his
father’s ‘*ācārya*’ in the real sense of this term.—(160)

‘*Agredidhiṣūpatiḥ*’—According to Medhātithi, this means (a) the
‘*Didhiṣūpati*’, *i.e*., one who makes love to his brother’s widow
(according to 173 below)—and also (b) the ‘*Agredidhisū*’, *i.e*., the
man whose wife dallies with another person (according to definition
quoted by Medhātithi on 173). This interpretation is supported by Manu
3.173 (read with Prajāpati, quoted by *Maskari Bhāṣya* on Gautama sūtra
15.16), which adds to Manu 173, the further assertion *saṃ caiva jīvato
bhrātuḥ sa cāgredidhiṣūḥ samṛtaḥ*, which would apply the name
*agredidhiṣū* to that man whose wife dallies with his younger brother,
during his own life-time. It may be remarked that Gautama (15.16)
contains the compound *agredidhiṣūpatididhiṣūpati*; and it has been
construed by the *Maskari-bhāṣya* to mean *agredidhiṣū* and
*didhiṣūpati* (thus supporting Medhātithi); or (1) *agredidhiṣūpati*
(husband of a girl who is married before her elder sister) and
*didhiṣūpati* (husband of a girl whose younger sister is married before
her).

Medhātithi does not resolve the compound, as Buhler puts it, into
‘*agredidhiṣūpati*’ and ‘*didhiṣūpati*’; in fact he actually denies that
there is any such person as ‘*agredidhiṣūpati*’;—though it is difficult
to see how this statement here by Medhātithi is to he reconciled with
what he says under verse 173 below, that ‘the definition of
*Agredidhiṣūpati* should be learnt from another *Smṛti*’,—and this
definition is quoted as ‘if the brother is alive, the man is to be known
as *Agredidhiṣūpati*; so that the *Didhiṣūpati* is the man making love
to his *dead* brother’s wife’ (according to Manu 3.173), while
*Agredidhiṣūpati* is one whose wife dallies with his younger brother
during his own life-time.

Kullūka quotes Laugākṣi to the effect that ‘when the younger sister is
married while the elder is still unmarried, the former is the
*Agredidhiṣū* and the latter the *didhiṣū*’; and on the strength of this
he would exclude ‘the husband of the younger sister marrying before her
elder sister. But as rightly remarked by Buhler, this definition of
Laugākṣi cannot be accepted in the interpretation of Manu who has
himself (in verse 173) provided a totally different definition. It is
interesting to note that the Maskaribhāṣya on Gautama (15.16) attributes
to Manu the definition quoted by Kullūka as Laugākṣi’s.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, which quotes this text of Manu on p. 688, and
explains it on p. 693) cites the verse quoted by Kullūka (from
Laugākṣi), but attributes it to Devala, and explains the term
‘*agredidhiṣūpati*’ in the same manner as Kullūka.

‘*Dyūtavṛttiḥ*’—‘He who makes a living by gambling’ (Medhātithi, who
does *not* explain the term to mean ‘one who makes others play for his
profit’; also Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘the keeper of a gambling-house’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

‘*Putrācāryaḥ*’ is explained in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 694) as
‘*akṣarapāṭhakaḥ*’ the teacher of alphabets. So the status of the
Primary School Teacher of ancient days was no better than that of their
representatives at the present day!

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481).

‘*Gaṇḍamāti*’—on whose cheeks and throat there appear swellings in the
form of a string.

‘*Śvitra*’—is white leprosy, leucoderma.

‘*Piśuna*,’ ‘*backbiter*,’ is one who betrays other people’s secrets,
and accuses them on the sly.

‘*Lunatic*’—whose mind is unsettled, either when there is derangement of
his humours or when he is obssessed by a ghost, and he says and does
things at random.

‘*Blind man*’—who is without eyes.

‘*Derider of the Veda*’—“The *derider of the Veda* has been already
mentioned before by the term ‘*brahmadviṭ*’ ‘who is inimical to
Brahman,’ where the term ‘*brahman*’ has been explained as having
several meanings (signifying the *Brāhmaṇa* as well as the *Veda*).”

Not so; *deriding* is something totally different from being *inimical*;
being *inimical* is a property of the mind, while *deriding* is speaking
ill, of one by words expressing disregard.—(161)

‘*Water-courses*’—the sources of water;—‘*he who diverts*’ these;
*i.e*., having cut the embankments, takes the water to irrigate his
field, &c.

‘He who is addicted to obstructing them’—*i.e*, the water-courses.

‘*Obstructing*’ means *covering up*; hence the meaning is that^(‘)he who
closes the source from which the water flows.’

The person who advises regarding the position of houses;—one who lives
by the science of architecture; *i.e*., the architect, the mason, and so
forth. One who plans his own houses is not meant here.

‘*Messenger*,’—the king’s servant; who is employed by him as a slave. He
is one who is employed in business relating to peace and war.

He who plants trees for payment. Planting them as a righteous act is not
reprehensible; because such an act would not be ‘reprehensible
practice;’ in fact, the planting of trees has been actually enjoined, as
we learn from such assertions as^(‘)he who has planted ten mango-trees
goes not to hell.’—(163)

‘*He who sports with dogs*’—*i.e*., keeps dogs for sporting purposes.

‘*Falconer*’—he who lives on falcons,—*i.e*, by baying and selling them.
The ‘*bird-keeper*’ mentioned before (162) is one who keeps them in
cages.

He who makes a virgin cease to be a virgin is called ‘the defiler of
virgins.’

The ‘*cruel man*’ is one who takes delight in killing animals.

He who derives subsistence from serving the Śūdras.

‘*Vṛṣalaputraḥ*’ is another reading (for ‘*vṛṣalavṛttiḥ*’), which means
‘he who has only *Śūdra* children;’ ‘having only Śūdra children’ being a
‘reprehensible act.’

He who sacrifices to the deities called ‘*gaṇas*.’ ‘*Gaṇayāgas*’ are
well known.—(164)

‘*Right* *conduct*’ stands here for the ordinary acts of courtesy, such
as offering worship to persons coming to one’s house, and so forth;—he
who is devoid of this.

^(‘)*Without vigour*’—*i.e*., with very little energy; who has lost all
enthusiasm for doing his duties.

‘*Constant beggar*’—one who is always begging, he who teases people by
his begging; it is in the very nature of things that begging should
displease the person bagged from. The term ‘*yācanakaḥ*’ is formed with
the ‘*yu*’ affix, according to Pāṇini 3.1.134, and then the reflexive
‘*ka’* added to it.

‘*He who lives by agriculture*’—by doing the cultivating himself; or
even by the cultivating done by others, if other means of living are
available.

‘*One suffering form elephantiasis*’—whose one leg is thicker than the
other,

‘*He who is spoken ill of by good men*’—the unfortunate man, who is
despised by good men, even without doing anything wrong.—(165)

‘*Urabhra*’ is *sheep*; one who ‘deals’ in these,—*i.e*., carries on the
business of buying and selling them; it may also mean ‘one whose chief
wealth consists in sheep.’

Similarly, the ‘*buffalo-keeper*.’

‘He who has had another man for her former husband;’—the husband of such
a one; *i.e*., one who marries again the woman who has been previously

(*bhavati*) the husband; such a husband is called ‘*paunarbhava*’ by the
scriptures.

These ‘*should be avoided with care*’— (166).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 688), which (on p.
694) explains ‘*Aurabhrikaḥ*’ as ‘one who keeps sheep as a means of
livelihood’,—and *māhiṣikaḥ*’ as meaning either (a) ‘one who keeps
buffaloes’, or (b) ‘the son of an unchaste woman’,—this latter
explanation being based upon a text quoted from Devala,—‘An unchaste
wife is called *Māhiṣī*; the son born of her is called *Māhiṣikaḥ*,’—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 484);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which
explains ‘*pretaniryātakaḥ*’ as ‘one who carries dead bodies on payment
of wages’.

This is re-iterated in the present verse, in order to indicate that,
just as the thief and the rest are ‘defilers of the company,’ so equally
blameworthy is the unlearned Brāhmaṇa also.

Others offer the following explanation:—The present verse is intended to
indicate the occasional admissibility, to the offerings for gods, of
such blind and other disabled, but learned, Brāhmaṇas as happen, at some
particular time, to be free from any reprehensible practice; the sense
of the text being—‘The unlearned Brāhmaṇa should be avoided, but why
should not the offering be not presented to one who is learned?’ It is
for this reason that the text mentions the ‘offering *for gods*’ So that
what is meant is that, at the offering to gods, it is only the
*unlearned* Brāhmaṇa that should be excluded, while those whose
practices are reprehensible, and are on that account distinctly debarred
by a direct prohibition, should be excluded from *both* the offering to
gods and that to pitṛs,—and only from that to ancestors. Vaśiṣṭha has
said: ‘If a person learned in the Veda happen to be stigmatised by such
bodily defects as are regarded as defiling the company, such a person
Yama declares to be unblameworthy; in fact, such a person is a
sanctifier of the company.’

‘*Becomes quenched in the same manner as the fire of dry grass*;’—The
fire of dry grass cannot cook the sacrificial offerings, and it becomes
quenched as soon as the offering is thrown into it, and also becomes
extinguished; anything offered into it does not become burnt to ashes;
and hence such an offering becomes futile; since it has been laid down
that ‘one should not pour libations into fire that is not burning
brightly, the fire embodies all deities;’—exactly of the same *nature*
as the fire of dry grass is the unlearned Brāhmaṇa. This is what the
text means by the words ‘*As no libations are poured on ashes*;’ just as
the fire of dry gross becomes turned into ash before (burning the
offerings), and people do not pour libations into such fire, similarly,
the unlearned Brahman is not fed.—(168)

Medhātithi is misrepresented by Buhler, who says that “according to
Medhātithi the object of this verse is to admit virtuous and learned
men, afflicted with bodily defects, as guests at rites in honour of the
gods.” As a matter of fact, this explanation is adduced by Medhātithi as
given by ‘others’; its meaning, given by himself being that ‘just as the
thief and the rest are defilers of company, so equally blameworthy is
the unlearned Brāhmaṇa also’,—exactly as Kullūka explains the verse.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 465);—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 41).

‘*Devoid of self-restraint*’—uncontrolled; whose practices are not
controlled by the scriptures.

‘*Those who have superseded their elder brother*,’ and the like, are, in
fact, outside the pale of the scriptures; yet they have been mentioned
here with a view to differentiate them from others, and also to indicate
the gravity of their offence.

‘*Others that are unworthy of company*’—such as the blind man, the man
affected with elephantiasis, and so forth.

The food that is eaten by those people, at a *Śrāddha*, is consumed by
‘demons’—the enemies of gods,—and not by one’s ancestors. That is to
say, the *Śrāddha* becomes entirely useless.

The mention of ‘*demons*’ is a purely deprecatory exaggeration.—(1 *7*

‘*Agraja*,’ ‘*elder brother*’—is the uterine brother born before one.
Thus has it been asserted—‘There is no harm in the superseding of the
uncle’s sons, the step-mother’s sons and the sons of other’s wives, by
marriage and the setting up of fire;’ hence, in the present context, the
term ‘elder brother’ stands for the uterine brother. While he
‘*remains*’—*i.e*., without marriage and without having set up the fire;
the root ‘*stkā*’ (in the term ‘*sthitê*’) has been used in the sense of
*the absence of the act mentioned*.

The term ‘*agnihotra*,’ though the name of the *act* of sacrifice,
stands for the *setting up of fire* for purposes of that act.

In another *smṛti*, we find an exception—‘the lunatic, the sinner, the
leper, the outcast, the eunuch and the consumptive need not be waited
for.’ What is mentioned here is meant to be indicative of the condition
in the form of the elder brother being in any way not entitled (to marry
and set up the fire). Hence the ‘defiler of company’ is also included.

A special period has also been specified during which one is to wait for
his elder brother to marry and set up the fire—‘one should wait for
eight years,’—‘some say for six years’ (*Gautama*, 18.19). This period
is to be reckoned from the time when the younger brother has reached the
age of marriage; and the age of marriage is the time when one has duly
fulfilled the injunction of Vedic Study.

“As a matter of fact, the period of time stated in the passage quoted
refers to the man who has gone out travelling. The passage quoted above
begins with the word ‘the elder brother being,’ which refers to the time
during which the elder brother is out on travel. \[So that it can have
no bearing upon *supersession* by marriage\].”

True; but the term ‘who has gone out on travel’ is distinctly found to
be connected with one sentence \[this sentence being ‘*pravrajite
nivṛttiḥ prasaṅgāt*, *Gautama*, 18.16\]; so that, for connecting the
same word with another sentence \[‘*bhrātari chaivam jyāyasi yavīyān*,
18.18\], some special reasons should be stated. There is, however, no
such reason; as there is in the case of such words as ‘there is
connection between this and the term *svarita*;’ no such words, however,
are found in the case of the sentences in question; nor is one sentence
incomplete without the connection of the word in question.

*Vaśiṣṭha* has used the generic term ‘fire and has, therefore, meant the
‘*Smārta*’ Fire.

Some people have held this definition of ‘superseder’ to apply also to
one whose father has not set up the Fire; the term ‘*agraja*,’ ‘elder,’
meaning simply ‘one born before one;’ so that the Father also is one’s
‘elder.’

In this manner, what is said here would apply to other ‘older’ persons
also; as a matter of fact, however, the terms ‘younger’ and ‘elder’ are
never used between father and son.

In another *Smṛti* we find—‘the elder *brother* being, etc., etc.’
(Gautama, 18.18. where the *Brother* is specifically mentioned).

The elder brother is called the ‘*superseded*’— (171)

*Medhātithi*—(P. 259, l.5)—‘*Bhrātarītyādi paṭhitam*’,—*i.e*., in
Gautama ‘*Pravrajite nivṛttiḥ prasaṅgāt*’ (18.16)... ‘*Bhrātari chaivam
jyāyasi yavīyān kanyāgnyupayameṣu*’ (18.18);—the latter *Sūtra* is
referred to again in 1.11.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.223) in the sense that—‘the
younger brother, who takes a wife or sets up the Fire, before his elder
brother has done so, is called *Parivettā*, and the elder brother is
called *Parivitti*.’

*Aparārka* deals with this subject in detail, under this same text of
Yājñavalkya.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 170) quotes this verse and explains that the ‘elder
brother’ meant here is the *uterine* brother, not the step-brother.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 760), which also explains
that the ‘elder brother’ meant is the *uterine brother*, as is clearly
declared in a text quoted from Garga. It quotes another verse from
‘Manu’, which is not found in our texts:—

&gt; agraje brahmacaryasthe yo'nujo dārasaṅgraham \|  
&gt; kurute parivettā sa paricitto'grejo bhavet \|\|

It has a curious note regarding the exact signification of the term
‘*ṣodarya*’ (generally understood to mean *uterine*): It
says—‘*sodaryatva*’ is of three kinds—(1) due to the father being the
same; (2) due to the mother being the same, and (3) due to both being
the same; the idea that ‘*sodaryatva*’ is based upon the sameness of the
Father is derived from the *Garbhopaniṣad* text that ‘at first the fetus
is born in the male’, as also from the *Mahābhārata* text—‘Having stayed
in the father’s stomach, he entered the Mother through his semen’; and
again in the same work, Kacha is representented as saying to Devayānī
that she was his ‘sister’ because she had lived in the same father’s
stomach as he himself had done.

The verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācara, p. 690), where also
‘elder brother’ is explained as the *uterine brother*;—also in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 723), where the construction of the phrase
‘*agraje sthite*’ is explained as ‘*agraje anūḍhe akṛtāgnihotre ca
sthite*’. The untraced verse from ‘Manu’ quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* is
quoted here also.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 233) as forbidding the
setting up of the Fire by the younger brother if it has been already set
up by his elder;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 445, and again on p. 1050) as
defining the *Parivitti*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 811), which notes that
this refers to *uterine* brothers only, and that also not in cases where
the elder brother is either an outcaste, or insane, or sexless, or
blind, or deaf, or dumb, or idiot, or dwarf, or leper, or suffering from
leucoderma, or consumptive, or suffering from dropsy, or from some
incurable disease, or heretic, or renunciate, or gone away for a long
time;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 371);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p.
514).

While he is dealing with the subject of ‘supersession,’ the author
proceeds to state its prohibition by showing the evil that befalls all
persons connected with it.

He who is passed over, insulted, by the marriage is the ‘*superseded
elder brother*;’ and he who does the passing over of the elder brother
is ‘*the superseding younger brother*;’—that girl through whom the
superseding is done;—‘*all these go to hell*.’

The ‘*giver*’ and the officiating priest form the fifth of those that go
to hell. The ‘*giver*’ meant here must be that of the girl, her father
and other guardians; that such is the meaning is clear from the context.

The ‘*officiating priest*’ is one who performs the *Homa* in marriage,
or he who guides the ceremony. Or, it may mean ‘one who officiates as
priest at the performance of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other sacrifices by
the aforesaid four persons—the superseded elder brother, the superseding
younger brother, the girl that is married, and he who gives her away.’

For this reason, the elder brother should act in such a manner that he
does not form an obstacle in the marriage of his younger brother; and
the younger brother also should wait for twelve, eight or six years; and
the girl also should not allow herself to be given away to such a
person;

The compound ‘*dātṛyājakapañcamāḥ*’ is to be expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*,
containing *Dvandva*: a ‘*Dātṛyājakau (Dvandva) pañcamau yeṣām*’
(Bahuvrīhi).—(172)

He who, acting in accordance with the law of ‘*Niyoga*,’ should happen
to make love to—take delight in intercourse with—the wife of his dead
brother;—‘*lasciviously*’—*i.e*., in transgression of the exact form of
‘*Niyoga*,’—*i.e*., renouncing the injunction that ‘one should have
intercourse with his brother’s wife only *once* during her periods,’—if
he should have recourse, at will, to such advances as cousist in firm
embrace, kissing, and so forth,—or if he should have intercourse with
her more than once,—or even allow his mind to be inclined that
way,—then, such a person, impressed with the mark of passion by such
signs, as casting longing glances upon the woman, and so forth, is to be
known as the ‘*didhiṣūpati*.’

The exact definition of the ‘*agredidhiṣūpati*’ is to be learnt from
another *Smṛti*, which says—‘when the brother is alive, the man is to be
known as the *agredidhiṣūpati*.’

Some people have held that the present verse does not form part of the
text at all; and as a reason for this, they urge the fact of its being
incomplete. It being necessary to provide definitions of both (the
*didhiṣūpati* and the *agredidhiṣūpati*), it is not possible for authors
who know their business to provide the definition of only one of them;
specially, as another *Smṛti* has provided the definitions of
both:—(*a*) ‘the wise men regard him as *didhiṣūpati*, who is the
husband of a woman who has had a previous husband; and (*b*) that
Brāhmaṇa is to be regarded as the *agredidhiṣūpati* of whom that woman
was the wife;’—and

these definitions are not applicable to the present context (which might
have justified the omission by our author); as (the husband of a woman
who has had a previous husband’ has been excluded already before (in
verse 160). Hence the ‘*didhiṣūpati*’ must be different from the one
defined as such in the passage just quoted (from another *Smṛti*).—(173)

It is interesting to note that Medhātithi states that “some people have

(*Trans*, p. 194).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 452) as providing a definition of
‘*didhiṣūpati*’ as distinct from that provided by *Devala*, according to
whom he is the husband of the girl whose younger sister is married
before her;—and it adds that the implication of the definition itself is
that such a person is to be excluded.

While the husband is alive, if a son is born to his wife living in his
house, from a paramour tolerated by the forgiving nature of the
husband,—this son born of a stranger is called ‘*Kuṇḍa*.’

That born after the husband has died, is ‘*Golaka*.’

Some people have held that these names are given to sons born to the
woman not ‘appointed’ by her husband (to bear children).

This, however, is not right; as in that case their exclusion would be
secured by the more fact of their being *non-Brāhmaṇas*. Hence we
conclude that the ‘*Kuṇḍa*’ and the ‘*Golaka*’ are sons born to the
woman ‘appointed’ by her husband.

“But how is it that the eons born to the *unappointed* woman are
*non-Brāhmaṇas*, while those born to the *appointed* woman are
*Brāhmaṇas?*”

This follows from the fact that, in the definition of castes, the term
‘wife’ is mentioned: ‘In the case of all castes, one born of the *wife*
of the same caste, etc., etc.’ (10.5). This term ‘*wife*,’ like the term
‘*husband*,’ is a relative one; the term ‘wife,’ ‘*patnī*,’ again, has
been explained (*etymologically*) as *associated with one at sacrificial
performances*; and no man is entitled to perform.sacrifices in
association with another man’s wife.

“If that be so, then no *Brāhmaṇa-hood* should belong to the sons born
to the *appointed woman*, in whose case also the same reason is
applicable.”

This question we shall determine under Discourse 10 (verse 5).

Or, both—the sons of the appointed as well as those of the unappointed
woman—may be regarded as ‘non-Brāhmaṇas;’ but the difficulty is that, as
has been already pointed out above, if these persons are not Brāhmaṇas,
then, there being no possibility of these being admitted to dinners, any
prohibition of them would be altogether uncalled for. Specially, as
their exclusion would be secured by the exclusion of the ‘out-cast.’
Being an ‘out-cast’ consists in falling off from the duties of the
Brāhmaṇa; and as *eating at śrāddhas* is a duty of the Brāhmaṇa, such
feeding may- not be possible for the out-cast. And yet we find his
exclusion asserted in verse 150 above,—(174)

The plural number in ‘*prāṇinaḥ*,’ ‘*creatures*,’ is according to Pāṇini
1.2,58.

These people do not deserve the names of ‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ and the rest; and
they only deserve to be called ‘creatures;’ they are not worthy of any
other name. For this reason, they ‘*cause the destruction of the

The terms ‘*parivettṛ*’ (superseder) and the rest are not sufficiently

‘*Pāṅktya*’ are those that deserve the *paṅkti, line*. One is called
‘*pāṅktya*’ when one is deserving of sitting on the same seat as, and
eating in the company of, good men. He who is not so deserving, is

satisfaction of his ancestors—fails to be accomplished.

For this reason, when one is performing *śrāddhas*, one should send away
from that place all thieves and others.

“How can there be any *looking* by the blind man;—by virtue of which the
text says ‘*the* blind man *by looking*, etc.’?”

True; what is meant is only his proximity to the place. The meaning is
that, in an uncovered place, the blind man should be removed away from
such distance from which the man with eyes could see.

‘*The one-eyed man of sixty*;’—this does not mean that if the number is
more than these, they may be fed (even in the presence of the blind,
etc.). All that the reducing of the number means is that the delinquency
would be less serious, and hence the expiatory rite to be performed
would be on a smaller scale.

It is the *leper* that is called ‘*śvitrī*.’

‘*The man suffering from a foul disease*’—is well known,—(177)

In connection with the present subject, the author points out the
impropriety of receiving gifts from one who officiates at sacrifices
performed by *Śūdras*.

‘*Though learned in the Veda*;’—if he accepts the gift of something
belonging to one who officiates at sacrifices performed by *Śūdras*,

‘*Through covetousness*’—is a mere reiterative reference.

He also *perishes quickly*—*i.e*., he is deprived of what he desires,—in
the shape of wealth, children, cattle, body, and the like.

When such is the fate of one learned in the Veda—what is to be said of
one who is ignorant of the Veda?

The author will point out later on that there is not much harm in the
learned man’s receiving gifts.

‘*Āma*’—unbaked—‘*pātra*’—vessels, such as saucer, and the like.

‘*In water*’—*i.e*., when thrown into water.—(179)

The sense is that the man becomes born in that species of creatures
where ordure is eaten.

Similarly, with the physician.

‘*Becomes lost*’—*i.e*., fruitless; or source of anxiety; anything that
is ‘lost’ becomes a source of anxiety.

That which has no place, no existence at all, is called ‘*apratiṣṭham*.’

Various forms of expression have been used here to show the
fruitlessness of the gift and also the evils attaching to the giver. The
terms ‘*lost*’ and ‘*without place*’ should not be regarded as
synonymous, as there is a distinct difference in their effects.—(180)

What is meant is that ‘the man will be born as an animal feeding upon
the things specified’ (according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—that ‘the food will be rejected by the Pitṛs and Gods, as
impure’ (according to Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Apratiṣṭham*’—‘Has no place’ (Medātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghvānanda);—‘secures no fame to the giver’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This also is to be explained as the preceding verse.

It is the *feeding* of the Trader that is prohibited, not his proximity
to the place; because there is no ground for taking the words of the
present verse as conveying this latter sense, as there was in the case
of a previous verse (177), where the term, ‘by looking,’ was taken as
indirectly indicating ‘visible place,’ and hence prohibiting the man’s
proximity to the place.

The man ‘*born of the a remarried woman*’ shall be described later on,

A few unfit persons,—such as the *blind*, and the rest—have been
specifically mentioned in the foregoing verses, describing the evil
results of giving food to those unworthy of company; apart from these,
there are others, the ‘*thief*,’ and the rest, mentioned in the several
contexts; when these are fed, the following things accrue to the giver:
*viz*., fat, blood, flesh, &c. That is, he becomes born as creatures who
feed on these things; *i.e*., such creatures us insects and such
carnivorous animals as vultures, and the like.

“*The wise*”—those learned in the Veda say this.

The upshot of the whole is as follows:—If one feeds such persons as are
unworthy of company, the duty of performing the *Śrāddha* is not
accomplished; and its nonperformance leads inevitably to the sin of
disobeying an injunction;—specially, as the injunction of *Śrāddha* is
absolutely obligatory.—(182)

that the ‘sanctifier of company,’ by reason of the excellence of his

them; just as the impure man, dining with others, makes even faultless
men defective.

This verse does not sanction the feeding of men unworthy of company. All
that it means is, that one should always seek for the ‘sanctifier of
company;’ and that if one such person has been found, one might
feed,—even though it he futile to do so,—those who have not been
carefully examined to three degrees of ancestors, if they are not found
to be marked by any perceptible disqualifications. It is with this end

“It is persons such as these that have been mentioned as fit for being
fed; what further excellence is here mentioned, by virtue of which these
men are described as ‘sanctifiers of company?’”

It has been laid down above that food should be given to one possessed
of even slight knowledge, only if he happens to be learned in the Veda.
In the present instance, however, mere learning is not mentioned as the
only condition of being a ‘Sanctifier of Company.’ In fact, this latter
character of being a ‘Sanctifier of Company’ is dependent upon the
presence of special qualifications; and hence it cannot be right to
accept it in cases of lower qualifications. Thus the present verse is
meant to sanction the giving of food to one who is simply learning the
Veda, in the absence of fully learned persons. So that, in the absence
of the fully learned man, the giving of food to one who is learning the
Veda is the first course to be adopted, and not merely a secondary one.

The plural number is used, in view of the individual men.

The particle ‘*ca*’ has the cumulative sense.—(184)

‘*Triṇāciketa*’ is the name of a portion of the Yajurveda, beginning
with the words ‘*pītodakā jagdhatṛṇā*; and the man is called
‘*triṇāciketa*’ by the circumstance of his having learnt that portion.
Others, however, explain that there are certain observances prescribed
for those who are learning the *Tṛṇāciketa* Mantras; and the person who
has kept these observances is called ‘*Triṇāciketa*.’ Here also the term
is applied to the man only figuratively.

It should not be thought that merely this (fact of having learnt a
certain portion of the Veda) makes one a ‘Sanctifier of Company;’ what
is meant is, that when the other qualifications of being learned in the
Veda and the like are present, the circumstance here mentioned forms an
additional qualification as indicating the character of being a
‘Sanctifier of Company.’

‘*Five fires*,’ ‘*Pañcāgnividyā*,’ is the name of a certain teaching
occurring in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* (5.10.9), the reward whereof has
been described in the words ‘*stenohiraṇyasya*, etc.’ The man is also so
called by the circumstance of his having learnt the said teaching, as in
the case of the previous word.

Others have explained the term ‘*Pañcāgni*’ as ‘one maintains the five
fires,’—*i.e*., the three sacrificial fires, the social fire and the
domestic fire. Of these, the ‘social fire’ is that which is lighted in
many countries with large quantities of fuel, for the purpose of
relieving cold.

‘*Trisuparṇa*’ is the name of a *mantra* occurring in the *Taittirīya
Veda*, and also in the *Ṛgveda*, beginning with the words ‘*ye brāhmaṇās
trisuparṇam paṭhanti*; etc.’

The ‘*six-limbed science*’ is the Veda; one who has learnt this.

One who is born of a woman who has been married in the “Brāhma”
form,—*i.e*., who has been given to a bridegroom brought home by
invitation.

‘*One who sings the Jyeṣṭha Sāmas*;’—The ‘*Jyeṣṭhadohas*’ are
*Sāman-mantras* found in the *Āraṇyaka*; one who sings these is called
‘*Jyeṣṭhasāmaga*.’ Here also the man is so called by reason of his
singing the *Sāman* and keeping the observances in relation to it.—(185)

(Medhātithi says it is a *mantra* found in the *Taittirīya* and the
*Ṛgveda*); and he who knows that text and its meaning is also called by
the same name;—‘*ṣaḍaṅgavit*’—‘one who knows the texts.and meanings of
the six subsidiary sciences, *Śikṣā, Kalpa* and the
rest’;—‘*Brāhmadeyānusantānaḥ*’—‘one who is born of a mother married in
the Brāhma form’;—‘*Jyeṣṭhasāmagaḥ*’—‘one who is constantly singing Sāma
hymns,’ or ‘he who keeps the observance known as *Jyeṣṭha-sāma*, and
knows the Sāma texts known under that name’.

‘*Triṇāciketaḥ*’—see Āpastamba, 2.17.22.

‘*Pañcāgniḥ*’—‘Knowing the Pañcāgnividyā, taught in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad 4.10 *et. seq*.’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘who keeps the five
Fires’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

‘*Trisuparṇa*’.—‘One who knows the text of Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 10.38-40’
(Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘one who knows Ṛgveda 10.114.3-5’

‘*He who understands the meaning of the Veda*.’

“The *knower of the ‘six-limbed science*’ has already been mentioned.”

True; but the man meant here is one who himself, even without the help
of the Subsidiary Sciences, finds out the meaning of the Veda, by his
own intelligence. Or, the same person spoken of before may be taken as
referred to again and again; the meaning being that in the absence of
the knowledge of the meaning of the Veda, people are not deserving of
being fed at *Śrāddhas*, even though they may have other qualifications.

‘*One who expounds it*’—*i.e*., the meaning of the Veda.

‘*The, Student*.’

‘*The giver of a thousand*;’—in the absence of mention of any particular
thing, this should be taken to mean ‘*one who has given away* a
*thousand cows*.’ But the right view appears to be that the term,
‘*thousand*,’ standing for *much*, the person meant is one who gives
much, *i.e*., the extremely generous person; specially, as there is
nothing definite to indicate that the number refers to *cows*. But the
Veda having asserted that^(‘)cows are the mothers of sacrifice,’—where
no particular thing is mentioned—*cows* should be understood to be
meant.

‘*The centenarian*’—*i.e*., one who is of advanced age; such a person,
having all his impurities cleared off, acquires the sanctifying
character. The ‘*centenarian*’ is one whose life extends over a hundred
years; the number being taken, on the basis of usage, as referring *to
years*. Or, the term ‘hundred’ may be taken as standing for *many*, so
that the word means ‘long-lived,’ ‘of advanced age.’

Gautama (15.10-11) has declared that ‘gifts should first be made to
young men;—others say it is like the Father;’ and people have taken the
term ‘*Student*’ of the present verse as conveying this same idea; the
student being the person of ‘early age.’—(186)

It has been explained what sort of Brāhmaṇas should be fed; now the
author proceeds to describe other details of procedure.

‘*On the preceding day*’—on the day preceding the one on which the
*śrāddha* is to be performed; *i.e*., if the performance falls on the
*Amāvāsyā* or the *Trayodaśī*, then on *Caturdaśī* or *Dvādaśī*,
respectively;—*i.e*., when one is going to perform the *Śrāddha*
to-morrow, one should invite the Brāhmaṇas to-day.

‘*On the next day*’—*i.e*., on the same day as the performance.

The option here laid down is in consideration of the rules: if one is
able to follow the rules closely, then one should do the inviting on the
previous day; but if one is unable to do so, then one may do it on the
same day. There is no doubt, however, that a strict observance of the
rules would bring great rewards.

When the invitation is made, the inviter is to be approached and urged
with entreaties.

Those of whom three is the least number,—this is what is meant by ‘*at
least three*.’ That is, the least number that should be fed is *three*;
in the event of his being able to feed more, ‘he should feed an odd
number, according to his enthusiasm,’—as has already been prescribed
above.

The rest of the words are meant only to fill up the verse.

‘*Approached*,’— arrived.

‘*Such as has been described*,’—*i.e*., mentioned above—(187)

This verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 83);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 697) as laying down certain details
regarding the inviting of Brāhmaṇas at *Śrāddhas*;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.225), as justifying the option of inviting the Brāhmaṇas on ‘the day
following’ (the ‘previous day’ *i.e*., on the day of the performance
itself);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 1133 and 1146), which adds the
following notes—‘*Pūrvedyuḥ*’, ‘on the previous day,’ *i.e*., on the
Caturdaśī day if the Śrāddha is to be performed on
Amāvasyā;—‘*aparedyuḥ*’, ‘on the same day as the Śrāddha itself is
performed.’ We have an option here; he who can observe the rules of the
invitation for two days may do the inviting on the preceding day, others
who are not able to do so should do it on the Śrāddha day; the former
would be more meritorious as involving greater amount of self-denial;
others hold that the invitation is to be made on the previous day, if
the performer remembers the Śrāddha to be performed on the coming day;
and if one does not remember it, then he may invite the Brāhmaṇas on the
same day as the Śrāddha; others again hold that the invitation is to be
made on the Śrāddha day only when, for some reason, it cannot be made on
the preceding day; another view is that Householders are to be invited
on the previous day and Renunciates and Students on the same day. It
explains ‘*tryavarān*’ as ‘at least three,’ *i.e*., three, five or
seven; and adds that ‘*samyak*’ qualifies ‘*nimantrayet*’.

*Baudhāyana* (2.8, 6).—‘Either on the previous day, or early in the
morning on the same day, he shall invite persons, whose number shall not
be an even one and which shall be at least three, who are well-versed
expounders of the Veda, who are not related to him either by birth or
*gotra* or *mantra*, who are pure and equipped with *mantras*; and shall
seat them on seats prepared of kuśa grass, facing either the east or the
north.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2, 17, 11-15).—‘The invitation shall be on the
previous day;—on the next day, the second one;—and the third is the
request;—some people teach that the Śrāddha should consist of about
three as the first, so the second and the third.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11, 14).—‘During the dark fortnight, after the fourth day,
he shall make an offering to the Pitṛs: having got them together on the
previous day, either Brāhmaṇas or renunciates or hermits,—such as are
advanced in age, have not deviated from their duties, are learned in the
Veda, are not the invitor’s own disciples or pupils; but he may feed
even his disciples, if they are possessed of special qualifications.’

*Viṣṇu* (73.1).—‘Going to perform the Śrāddha, he shall, on the previous
day, invite the Brāhmaṇas.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1, 225).—‘The man, himself pure and self-controlled,
shall, on the previous day, invite the Brāhmaṇas.’

*Hārīta* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 696).—‘Going to perform the Śrāddha the
next day, he should invite the Brāhmaṇas on the previous day.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 696).—‘He shall approach the Brāhmaṇa
saying—*I shall perform Śrāddha to-morrow*—on the previous day; if that
be not possible, then on the same day.’

*Devala* (Do.).—‘Having made up his mind that he shall perform Śrāddha
on the coming day, he shall invite the Brāhmaṇas;... if that be not
possible, then the next day.’

*Varāhapurāṇa* (Do., p. 697).—‘Knowing that he would be performing
Śrāddha on the next day, he shall clean the ground and invite the
Brāhmaṇas.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘On the previous day, at night, he shall
approach the Brāhmaṇas after they have taken their evening meal and
invite them, on behalf of his father.’

One invited ‘*at a rite in honour of Pitṛs*’—*i.e*., a t a
*śrāddha—‘shall remain self controlled*;’ *i.e*., with his mind under
control, he shall maintain continence and keep up also the other
restraints and observances—such as the observances of the ‘*Snātaka*,’
and so forth. The avoidance of dancing, music, etc., which are the
observances to be kept up by men, has been prescribed as part and parcel
of religions rites; hence the performer of the *śrāddha* shall so
arrange things that the invited Brāhamaṇa, from the moment he has been
invited, shall keep control over his sense-organs; otherwise the
*śrāddha* would become defective.

‘*He shall not recite the Veda*;’—what is prohibited is the *reciting*
of the texts of the Veda; the mere repeating of *mantras* during the
evening and morning prayers is not prohibited.

‘*Also the man who performs the Śrāddha*’—*i.e*., at the rite that one
performs in honour of the Pitṛs, one should, like the invitee, remain
self-controlled; the construction is—‘So the man also...... shall remain
self-controlled.’ The meaning is, that the rule regarding self-control
and avoiding of Veda-reciting applies alike to the inviter and the
invitee, from the moment of invitation onwards.—(188)

avoidance of dancing and music, &c. are all meant to be kept; the
meaning is that the inviter should see to it that the invited keeps
these restrictions:—‘*Chandāṃsi*’ Vedas;—‘*adhīyīta*’, ‘utter the words
of the Veda’; the *Japa* of texts is not prohibited:—the performer of
the *Śrāddha* himself also is to observe these restrictions; the role is
meant for both the inviter and the invited.

things: the second meal, journeying, carrying loads, study, sexual
intercourse, making and receiving gifts, and offering of oblations into

The present verse supplies a recommendation in support of the injunction
that the invited person should remain self-controlled.

Because ‘*the Pitṛs*,’—in their invisible forms —‘*attend upon*’—enter
into the body of—‘*the invited Brāhmaṇas*;’ just in the same manner in
which people are obsessed by evil spirits.

‘*Like the wind they follow him*;’—when a man moves along, the
‘*wind*’—in the form of his breath—follows him; and it does not leave
him while he is moving; and the Pitṛs also are in the form of air.

‘*So when they* ’—*the Brāhmaṇas*—‘*are seated*,’ “*they sit down*;’
*i.e*., they move when the Brāhmaṇas move and sit down when they are
seated. The meaning is that the invited Brāhmaṇas take the form of the
Pitṛs; hence those invited shall not be unrestrained in their
behaviour.—(189)

‘*Ketitaḥ*’ means *invited*.

‘*Havye kavye*’—at the rite in honour of Gods, and at the rite in honour
of the Pitṛs. Having accepted the invitation and promised to eat,—if
‘*somehow he neglects it*,’—*i.e*., does not present himself at the time
of eating, or, if he does not maintain continence,—then such a Brāhmaṇa
‘*becomes a hog*.’

‘*Somehow*’—*i.e*., either intentionally, or through lapse of memory.

‘*Duly*’—this has been added for the purpose of filling up the verse.

Others have held that the ‘*neglect*’ here stands for *non-acceptance of
the invitation*; according to what has been said in the
*Śrāddhakalpa*—‘one should not fail to accept the invitation of a man
free from all blame.’

This, however, is not right; it is through desire to eat that men become
prone to go to *śrāddhas*; and if a man happens to have no such desire,
and hence refuses the invitation, what sin could there be in
this?—(190.)

‘*Atikrāman*’—‘Does not present himself at the time of eating, and does
not maintain continence’ (Medhātithi, who is slightly misrepresented by
Buhler, who attributes to him only the latter part of the
explanation);—‘breaks the appointment’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who does not accept the invitation’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi, who rejects this explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 701) in support of
the view that the man ‘who having accepted the invitation, subsequently
refuses it, even though quite fit to respond to it, incurs a sin.’ It
explains ‘*ketitaḥ*’ as ‘being invited.’

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 565) quotes the verse;—also *Aparārka*, (p. 457),
which adds that this refers to the person who has accepted the
invitation;—and *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1002), which adds the following
notes;—‘*Ketitaḥ*,’ invited;—the meaning is that if, on an invitation,
the invited fails to keep the restrictions, he becomes a
pig;—‘*Kathañcit*,’ intentionally or through forgetfulness; others hold
that ‘*atikrāman*’ means ‘not accepting the invitation,’ but this view
has been criticised and rejected by Medhātithi.

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ here stands for *woman* in general; this is
indicated by the fact that the invitee has been advised to observe
strict *continence* (and not only avoidance of improper intercourse).
Hence, in the present context, the Brāhmaṇa woman also is a ‘*vṛṣalī*;’
the term (in this sense) being etymologically explained as ‘she who
tempts her husband’ (*bhartāram vṛṣasyati*). Tims, what the passage
means is as follows:—Having accepted invitation, if the man dallies with
a woman,—*i.e*., with a view to having sexual intercourse with her,
engages in such nets as conversation, embracing, and so forth,—then he
incurs the following evil: whatever sin there might be in the ‘giver,’
*i.e*., the performer of the *Śrāddha*—passes on to him. What this
indicates is the coming about of undesirable results; if this were not
what is meant, then it would mean that there is nothing wrong in doing
this, in a case where the giver is a sinless person.

‘*Dallying*’ stands for obtaining pleasure; hence it follows that one
should not do even such acts as conversation, embracing, and the
like.—(191)

‘*Vṛṣalī*’—‘Woman in general’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nandana and
Rāghavānanda);—‘a Śūdra woman’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 702), where it
apparently takes the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ as standing for the Śūdra
woman;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1006), which adds the following
notes—‘*vṛṣalī*’ stands here for *woman in general*,—the Brāhmaṇī also
is a ‘*vṛṣalī*’ in the sense that she ‘hankers after the male’
(*vṛṣasyati bhartāram*); hence the meaning is that ‘if after having
accepted the invitation, one enjoys the company of his wife he incurs
sin,’—‘*modate*’ means *enjoying*, hence conversing and embracing also
are to be avoided,—‘*dātuḥ*,’ of the performer of the
Śrāddha,—‘*duṣkṛtam*’ sin,—becomes transferred to the said transgressor,
*i.e*., some disagreeable results accrue to him. If the words were to be
taken in the literal sense then there could be nothing wrong in eases
where the inviter is a pure, sinless man.

‘*Free from anger*’—without wrath.

‘*Intent on purity*,’—‘purity’ standing either for external purity
obtained by means of clay and water, or internal purity obtained by
means of expiatory rites.

‘*Ever*’—qualifies ‘purity.’ Hence the meaning is that, whenever one
happens to spit or do any such unclean act, one should rinse one’s mouth
immediately.

‘*Chaste*’—avoiding all intercourse with women.

‘*Rid of all means of offence*—those by whom the means of offence have
been laid aside. ‘Offence’ stands for roughness and strife of all kinds.

‘*Supremely blessed*;’—‘blessedness’ consists in the presence of such
qualities as nobility, prosperity, and so forth.

Since it is in all this form that the Pitṛs enter into the body of the
Brāhmaṇas,—therefore, the Brāhmaṇas also should assume these same
forms;—this is what is enjoined by means of the commendatory description
contained in the verse.

‘*Foremost gods*.’—That in another time-cycle the ancestors were gods,
is an eulogium bestowed on the ancestors. They are called ‘*foremost*’
because they are worshipped *before* the gods.—(192)

water immediatly on sneezing or spitting,—‘*brahmacāriṇaḥ*,’ avoiding
intercourse with women,—‘*nyastaśastrāḥ*’, who have renounced
cruelty,—‘*mahābhāgāḥ*’, endowed with mercy, generosity and other such
qualities; ‘since Fathers are such the invited who take their form,

‘*Hiraṇyagarbha*’ is Prajāpati; his son is ‘*Manu, the son of
Hiraṇyagarbha*;’ as has been declared under Discourse I—‘Having created
all this and myself, &c., &c.’—of this Manu, the sons were ‘*Marīci and
the rest*’—*i.e*., Atri, Aṅgiras, and so forth; and these constitute the
‘Body of Pitṛs,’ ‘*Pitṛgaṇa*.’

An objection is raised—“For every person, his own Father, &c., are his
‘*Pitṛs*.’ The injunctions also are in the words—‘one should offer balls
to his father, grandfather and great-grandfather;’ ‘after this, the sons
should make offerings to three ancestors.’ What then is this that is
being said now—that ‘the sons oft he sages are the *Pitṛs*,’—or that
‘the *Somapās* are the Pitṛs of Brāhmaṇas?’ We cannot accept any such
option as that—‘one shall make an offering to the *Somapā*

Pitṛs,’ or ‘he shall make the offering to his father and grandfather;’
for the simple reason that in the original injunction we find the words
‘this should be done *by the son*;’ and ‘son’ is a relative term; and
later on (verse 221) we read—‘he whose father may be dead &c., &c.’ It
has, therefore, got to be explained what is the real meaning of the
present context,”

The answer to the above is as follows:—What the present verse contains
is merely a commendatory description supplementary to the foregoing
injunctions; and we never hear of the ‘*Somapa*’ and other Pitṛs spoken
as the recipients of offerings.

“But there is the injunction (in 193) that these *have to be
worshipped*.”

The root ‘*chara*’ (in ‘*upacaryāḥ*’) is denotative of mere *action* in
general; and as such, it cannot form the subject of any injunction. In
the Veda, we do not find any such action spoken of as ‘*upacāra*,’ in
the same manner as the acts of *sacrificing*, *giving* and the like. In
most cases, the root ‘*chara*’ is used, like the root ‘*kṛ*’ as
pertaining to some other *act* mentioned in close proximity to it; and
in the present case, the act mentioned in close proximity is that of
*offering the śrāddha*. This latter act having been already enjoined as
to be offered to a definite set of recipients, could not be again
enjoined as to be offered to other recipients. If it were again the
enjoined itself, then it would not be regarded as being in proximity to
another enjoined act; and the presence of the root ‘*chara*’ distinctly
precludes the possibility of any other act being understood, which is
not in proximity to another enjoined act. As for such usages in ordinary
parlance as ‘the Teacher should be worshipped,’ ‘*guravaḥ upacaryāh*’
(where we have the same term ‘*upacaryāḥ*’), there also the act that is
understood to be expressed is *service*, in the form of *washing the
feet*, and the like; and no such act as these is possible in connection
with the Pitṛs, And so long as a passage is capable of being construed
in a certain sense along with the context in which it occurs, there can
be no justification for assuming another meaning for it. If the
‘*Somapa*’ and the rest had been really intended as the recepients of
the *Śrāddha* offered by the several castes, then alone would there have
been any use for the description of their birth, &c. (as found in the
present verse). When, however, the verse is taken as a mere commendatory
description, then any description might come in useful.

Hence, the conclusion is, that the present verse proceeds with a view to
make those people undertake the performance of *Śrāddha* who may happen
to have no regard for their ancestors, and hence having no inclination
for doing any act on their behalf;—the purport being—‘do not you think
that the Pitṛs being dead men, what harm could they do if they were not
satisfied at the Śrāddha, or what good they could do by being
satisfied?—because they are, in reality, beings of tremendous power,
being the grandsons of Manu; who is the son of Hiraṇyagarbha, the lord
of the whole universe.’ It is for conveying this sense that the text has
used the term, ‘of the sages;’ which means that they are not ordinary
sons of Manu; it is those great sages, Marīci and the rest, who are
known as possessed of great powers; and it is of such sages that the
Pitṛs are the sons.

There are many people who would be led to the performance of *Śrāddhas*,
just by means of such laudatory descriptions.

Some people explain the verse to mean that “one should look upon the
Pitṛs as *Somapa* and the rest.

These, however, have to be disregarded; as there is no authority for any
such notion. We have no such assertion to this effect, as we have in
connection with the propriety of looking at the sun as *Brahman*.

Others, again, have offered the explanation that, what is meant is, that
the rule being that ‘offerings to the Pitṛs should be made after
pronouncing their *gotra* and name,’ and ‘*Somapā*,’ &c., are just the
names that have to be pronounced in connection with the several castes.

This also is not right; since the expression used is “*somapā nāma*,”
‘*by name* Somapā,’ these must be *names*, not *gotras*.

“But the term ‘name’ would be applicable also when these were *names* of
*gotras* only.”

If these were the names of *gotras*, then the two could not be in
apposition; the proper form would be, ‘*Somapā* is the *gotra* of the
Pitṛs,’ and not that ‘the Pitṛs are *Somapa*.’

“It is often found that the descendant is identified with his *gotra*,
and the name of the latter is applied to the former; *e.g*, in such
expressions as ‘Babhru is Mandu.’”

Our answer to this is as follows:—It has to be considered here what is
it that is called ‘gotra,’ As a matter of fact, the ‘*gotra*’ of a
family is its first progenitor who imparts his name to it, being the
most renowned person by virtue of his possessing such qualities as
learning, opulence, bravery, nobility and the like; and it is after him
that the family becomes named. Thus it is that among Brāhmaṇas and
others, there are sub-divisious of *gotras*. The personage whom his
descendants remember with such feelings as ‘we are the descendants of
such and such a person,’ would thus be the one after which that
particular family should be named. As a matter of fact, however, no men
are found to think of themselves as being ‘*Somapā*’ and thus regarding

‘*Somapā*’ as the name of their *gotra*;—in the manner in which people
regard the names of ‘Bhṛgu’, ‘Garga’ and

‘Gālaya.’ It is by these latter names that the *gotras* of Brāhmaṇas
should be known; as these are the principal *gotras*; the name ‘*gotra*’
applying to them by convention, and not by virtue of their fulfilling
the condition mentioned in the above-mentioned definition that ‘the
first progenitor, imparting his name to the family, is its *gotra*;’ in
fact, ‘*Bhṛgu*,’ &c., have been known as ‘*gotra*’ from beginningless
time, and their use in this sense is as much without beginning as the
use of the caste-names, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ and the rest. Prior to Parāśara’s
birth, no Brāhmaṇas could have been named after him; hence, if the
‘*gotra*’ consisted in the first progenitor, &c., then the Veda (which
makes mention of Parāśara as *gotra*) would have a beginning in time.
Thus, then, since the use of the name ‘*gotra*’ is beginningless, it is
this ‘*gotra*’ that is to be used in the pouring of water-libations. The
persons imparting their names to families are not beginningless; they
are modern; and at a Vedic rite, so long as one can make use of eternal
names, there can be no justification for pronouncing names that have had
a beginning in time. For these reasons, what the Brāhmaṇa should do when
offering the libation of water, &c„ is to pronounce the appropriate
‘*gotra-* name’—such as ‘may this offering go to the *Gargya*,’ or ‘to
one belonging to the *Garga-gotra*’—and then pronounce the name of the
person.

Among the *Kṣatriya* and the other castes, however, there is no such
usage regarding *gotra*. These latter do not retain the memory of their
‘*gotra*’ in the same manner as the Brāhmaṇas do. Hence, for them, the
‘*gotra*’ must be something pertaining to this world; and it is for
these that the ‘*gotra*’ consists of the ‘first progenitor, the most
renowned, who imparts his name to the family:’ hence it is that they are
referred to in *Śrāddha*, *etc*., by this *gotra-name*, even though it
is one that has had a beginning in time. These, *Kṣatriya, etc*., are
not worthy of being called by such titles as ‘*Havirbhuk*,’ and the
like.

Some people have held that—“the offerings enjoined as to be made with
such expressions as ‘I am inviting the Somapās,’ ‘may this reach the
Somapās,’ and the like, are by those persons, the names of whose father
and other ancestors are unknown.”

This also is not right; as it has been distinctly laid down that ‘one
not knowing the names of one’s ancestors should make the offerings
simply with the words *to the father, to the grandfather*, and so
forth.’

Further, there might be some justification for having recourse to the
several explanations of this verse, only if it were absolutely
impossible to construe it as serving the purposes of a commendatory
description supplementary to the foregoing injunction. But so long as it
is possible to construe the verse along with what has gone before, it
cannot be right to take it as an isolated assertion by itself.—(194)

All these verses are laudatory descriptions relating to *Śrāddhas*; as
they are all construable together. The ‘Pitṛs of the Sādhyas’ have not
been laid down as the recipients of *Śrāddhas*; specially because they
are gods, and also because the *Sādhyas* also, who are themselves gods,
are not entitled to the performance of *Śrāddhas*; for the simple reason
that they are not such as. can be directed to do an act. Gods cannot be
directed to do an act; for, if they were, this would deprive them of
their god-like character. If gods were entitled to the performance of an
act, they would be regarded as the ‘ *doer*;’ and the ‘doer’ or ‘agent’
could never be the ‘recipient;’ while, in reality, the very nature of
the gods consists in their being ‘recipients’ (of sacrifices).

The sous of Virāj are the *Somasads*; and these are the ‘Pitṛs of the
Sādhyas.’

\[The sense of all this laudatory description is as follows\]—This rite
in honour of the Pitṛs must always be performed; since, even the
*Sādhyas*, who are *gods*, and as such, have accomplished all that they
had to do, worship their Pitṛs.

The *Agniṣvāttas*, who are the Pitṛs of Agni and other Gods, relish the
cake and milk and rice cooked on fire.

‘*Mārīcāḥ*’—sons of Marīci.

‘*Lokaviśrutāḥ*’—famed in the world.—(195)

*Soma* (the Soma plant) is what is called ‘*anagnidagdha*’ (‘not burnt
by fire’); because it is not cooked on fire; and the gods to whom
sacrifices are offered with *Soma*, also come to be called
‘*Anagnidagdha*;’ which connotes the quality of *prosperity*.

Similarly, ‘*agnidagdha*’ (‘burnt by fire’) stands for such substances
as cooked rice, cake, and the like, which are all prepared on fire; and
the gods to whom sacrifices are offered with these are called
‘*Agnidagdha*.’

As before, we construe the verse to mean as follows:—‘Those that are
called *Agnidagdha* should be mentioned as *agnidagdha*, and those that
are called *Anagnidagdha* should be mentioned as *Somapā*.’

Similarly with ‘*Kāvyas*’ and ‘*Barhiṣuds* the ‘*Kāvyas*’ have been
described (in 198) as ‘Somapā;’ and ‘*Barhiṣads*’ as ‘the sons of Atri.’

The particle ‘*eva*’ is not to be construed where it occurs; as, in that
case, the meaning would be that all those mentioned are the Pitṛs of
*Brāhmaṇas only*, not of *Kṣatriyas* and others; and this would be
contrary to what has gone before. Nor have the beings in question been
mentioned as the Pitṛs of various castes, which alone could justify a
few of them being selected and marked as belonging specifically to
*Brāhmaṇas only*. Hence the ‘*eva*’ should be construed along with the
‘*Agniṣvāttas*,’ the ‘*Saumyas*,’ and the rest.

The mention of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ being purely reiterative, stands for the
Kṣatriya, &c. also.

The Pitṛs bearing the names here mentioned are found mentioned in the
Veda also:—‘The Pitṛs, named Agniṣvātta, Agnidagdha, Anagnidagdha.’ And
it is out of those mentioned in this *mantra* that our author has
selected some and described them here.

Or, the verse may be construed in the following manner:—‘The Pitṛs that
are spoken of by these names, all these one should mention as the
Brāhmaṇa’s Pitṛs:’ the mere difference in the names should not lead one
to think of the named beings being different.’ In this case, the term
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ would stand for ‘persons entitled to the performance of
Śrāddha;’ the Brāhmaṇa being so, above all others; and it is always the
predominant factor that serves as the indicative; as we find in the case
of such expressions as ‘the king is passing by.’

\[ *This latter interpretation, being much the simpler of the two, has
been adopted in the Text*.\]—(199)

The ‘*Somapā*,’ and the rest, are the ‘*principal bodies of Pitṛs*.’ Of
these there are endless sons and grandsons; and these latter also are
Pitṛs.

The mention;of this indefinite number indicates that the offerings are
not to be made in reference to the *Somapa* andothers; for, if the sons
and grandsons of these were ‘Pitṛs’ then, as Pitṛs, these sons and
grandsons also may have the offerings made in reference to them; and yet
no names of these have been mentioned; whence it is clear that all this
is merely laudatory description.

The singular number in ‘*putrapautrakam*’ is in accordance with Pāṇini
2.4.10.

‘*Endless*’—unlimited; the ‘*ka*’ having the reflexive sense.—(200)

The rite in honour of the Pitṛs should not be looked upon as inferior to
that in honour of the gods; in fact, the former is the more important of
the two; because by birth, the Pitṛs are elder than the gods. For, the
order of creation is that the Pitṛs were born from the sages, and the
gods were born from the Pitṛs, and from the gods, the whole of the rest
of the world—‘*moveable*’—animate—as well as ‘*immoveable*’—inanimate.

‘*In* *due order*’—the order having been already described under
Discourse I.

The entire series of purely laudatory descriptions has now come to an

‘*Vessels made of silver*’—those built entirely of silver. In the
absence of these ‘those, *connected with silver*’—*i.e*., vessels of
wood, or of copper, or of gold, should have one part touched with
silver. The vessels referred to here are those in which large quantities
of butter, honey and vegetables and other things are kept for being
offered; and in connection with these, it is enjoined that they should
be *of silver*. As for the actual offering of the *ball* and other
things, this has to be done with the hands; the libations of water—such
as those poured over the balls, etc.—these also should be offered, with
the hands; in view of the clear injunction that these offerings should
be made ‘with hand, the thread passing over the right shoulder.’ The
daily libations of water also are to be offered with the hands—the
thread passing over the left or the right shoulder.

“But all this has been laid down in connection with *śrāddhas*, and, as
such, cannot be connected with another act.”

Even such subsidiary details are admissible in an act as are not
mentioned in the same context with itself.

“But such details are already mentioned in connection with the act
itself.”

That may be so; and in that case, the present right may be only a
reiteration of the same.

‘*Even water*’—the term ‘*even*’ indicates high praise; the sense being
that—‘to say nothing of the offering of richly cooked food, even water
alone, if offered in a silver-vessel, becomes, by reason of its
connection with silver, ‘*conducive* *to imperishability*’—*i.e*., it
becomes the source of ever-lasting satisfaction (to the Pitṛs).

‘*With faith*;’—being already enjoined in connection with *all givings*,
its mention here is purely reiterative.—(202)

This only indicates the predominance of the rite in honour of the Pitṛs;

‘*Ārakṣa*’ is the same as ‘*rakṣā*;’ and that which has reached that is
called ‘*ārakṣabhūtam*;’ *i.e*., that which serves the purpose of
protecting.

Or, the term ‘*bhūtam*’ may be taken as connoting *similitude*; in which
case, the meaning is—‘which is, as it were, a protection.’

Because it is so, therefore ‘*one should first engage*’—invite—‘*the
Brāhmaṇa in honour of the gods*’— and make him sit upon a proper seat.

The rest of the verse is a purely laudatory description.

‘*Rākṣasas*;’—certain invisible beings, described in *Itihāsas*—‘*take
away*’—the Śrāddha—from the Pitṛs.

“Who are the gods, in honour of whom the Brāhmaṇa is to be invited?”

In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, we find the *mantra*—‘We invite the Viśvedevas,
&c.’—as the one to be used; from which it follows that the *Viśvedevas*
are the gods. In the *Purāṇas* also it is said—‘The *Śruti* says that it
is *Viśvedevas*.’—(204)

That in whose beginning and at whose end a rite in honour of the gods is
performed is said to ‘*begin and end with a rite in honour of the
gods*.’ The beginning of the *Śrāddha* rite should be made with a rite
performed in honour of the gods; it is for this reason that the
invitation of the Brāhmaṇas in honour of the gods should be done first.
‘*End*’ is *completion*. The meaning is that the Brāhmaṇas fed in honour
of the gods.should be dismissed after those fed in honour of the Pitṛs
have been sent away.

Some people hold that in the offering of sandal-paste, *&c*. also,
beginning should be made with what is done in honour of the gods.

But, in regard to these details, it is not possible to make either the
beginning or the end with what is done in honour of the gods; as this
would lead to repe???on (repetition?). Further, that *it should begin
and end with what is done in honour of the gods* has been laid down here
as pertaining to the entire procedure, and not to each of the
intervening details. That the performance of the details shall begin
with what is done in honour of the gods would follow from the natural
course of the action; it having been fixed that the inviting is to begin
with those invited in honour of the gods, it would be only natural that
the other details shall also start with the same with which that first
step had started; since one detail controls the starting of another
detail, as laid down in the assertion that—‘the starting of the details
is determined by the time fixed for them in connection with the Primary
Act.’

Such a *Śrāddha* -rite one shall ‘endeavour’ to perform.

The rest of the verse is a purely laudatory description.

‘*It should never be one beginning and ending with a rite in honour of
the Pitṛs*’—Inasmuch as it has been already enjoined that the act should
begin and end with what is done in honour of the gods, the further
prohibition of beginning and ending with what is done in honour. of the
Pitṛs has to be taken, in the manner of ordinary assertions, as a purely
descriptive reiteration. In ordinary parlance, having laid down one
thing, one often negatives its contrary, even though there be no
possibility of this latter being adopted. As a matter of fact, an action
controls the substance, not what is not a substance.

‘*Quickly perishes, along with his progeny*;’—this deprecatoy
description is meant to indicate that the man fails to obtain the reward
in the form of offsprings.

From this it follows that all the acts, of serving the food and the
like, should begin with what is done in honour of the gods. As for what
is done during the process—the serving of more rice, &c., at intervals,
the supplying of water to those that may happen to want water for
drinking, and so forth,—all this should be done first to one who may
happen to express his desire first. If one were to offer these things to
one who does not want them, simply because of his being invited in
honour of the gods, then one would be trans- greasing the principal
injunction that—‘one should make the Brāhmaṇas happy.’

Some one may happen to be fond of sweets, another may be one who finds
adds more wholesome; so that, having provided “various edibles and
fragrant drinks” (Manu, 3. 227), if, by other considerations, one were
to give to one what suits his taste and constitution, the invitee would
contract disease.

From all this it follows that in the feeding it is only the beginning
and end that should be done with those invited in honour of the
gods.—(205)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 456) as meaning that the Brāhmaṇa
to be fed in honour of the Viśvedevas should be invited before that to
be fed in honour of the Pitṛs; and concludes that the matter is purely
optional, in view of the contrary rule laid down by Pracetas;—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*, (p. 54);—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 526),
which explains ‘*daivādyantam*’ as ‘beginning and ending with the
offering to the Devas’, which means that the invitation is to be made
afresh in connection with the *Devakṛtya*, and the concluding rites
should be performed last of all for the Devas;—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1045), which says that the other rites shall begin with the
Devas, but the *Visarjana* is to be done last for the Devas.

‘*Secluded*’—large and unoccupied by many men.

‘*Sloping towards the south*’—that which is of lower level on the

one fails to find a spot that is not naturally so, one should make it
so, by one’s own effort.

This place he should smear with cowdung. This precludes the use of clay

This verse is quoted in ‘*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 652) in support of
the view that ‘even though it may not be possible for the performer to
find a spot sloping towards the south from himself, he should try and
make it slope southwards;’—in *Smṛtitattva* (page 107) in the sense that
the performer should sit on a place that has been previously smeared
with cowdung;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 483), which adds the following
explanations:—‘*shuchim*’—*i*.*e*., a sacred place, which is by itself
clean; or a place in his own house, which should be free from all
foreign sources of uncleanliness;—‘*viviktam*’ *i*.*e*., free from hairs
and other unclean things;—and the place should be beaten into a slope
towards the south—*i*.*e*., capable of allowing the performer to pour
offerings towards the south.

This is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 268);—in *Aparārka*, (p.
471), which explains ‘*vivikta*’ as ‘*vijana*,’ ‘not crowded by men;’
and adds that even though the place be clean, it should be smeared over

‘*Avakāśa*,’ is *place, spot*.

‘*Cokṣa*’—naturally clean and tending to mental calm; such as forests,
etc.

‘*Water-banks*’— sand-banks, near rivers.

‘*Secluded places*’—uncrowded sacred places.

This verse contains a totally different injunction. Hence, in the case
of such places, the rule regarding *smearing with cowdung* does not
apply; because the rule (in the preceding verse) distinctly says that
‘one should make it so;’ which means that the rule applies to a place
where *cleanness* has to be brought about. In regard to places that are
naturally clean, their fitness is secured by ‘being examined and
sprinkled with water.’

By the Śrāddha ‘*offered*’— performed—in such places, the Pitṛs become
greatly pleased.—(207)

After having seated them, he should worship them *with perfumes and
garlands*: ‘*Perfumes*’—in the form of saffron, camphor, and such
things—he should offer them; and so also ‘*garlands*’—strings of
flowers. The eptihet ‘*sweet-smelling*’ qualifies ‘*garlands*;’ the
sense being that one should not offer flowers devoid of sweet smell. The
epithet is proper as qualifying ‘perfumes’ also, as there are
evil-smelling perfumes also, which have to be excluded.

Or, the term may stand for ‘*surabhi*’ *incense*, in which case, this
term would stand by itself.

Having first given these things to the Brāhmaṇas invited in honour of
the gods, he should give them to those invited in honour of the Pitṛs.

This rule, that these things shall be given first to those invited in
honour of the gods, is meant to imply that before the Brāhmaṇas have
commenced eating, things should be given to them in that order. When
once they have begun to eat, there can be no restriction regarding the
serving of the several vegetables, etc. This is the explanation that is
offered; as otherwise, why should this have been laid down over and over
again.

‘*Unreproached*’—blameless—‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’ This is a mere reiteration; as
it is only such Brāhmaṇas as have been specified for being invited. Or,
the use of the past-participal affix nifty be taken as prohibiting the
act denoted by the verbal root; the sense being—that ‘he should not
reproach, or find fault with them, after (they have been invited and
seated).’ People who favour this explanation argue that it is better to
abandon the denotation of the affix than give up that of the entire
word; and if it is taken as a mere reiteration, the whole word becomes
redundaut and meaningless.—(209)

When the Brāhmaṇas have been smeared with perfumes, adorned with
garlands and have smelt the incense, the water-offering should be
presented; and, along with this, also sesamum along with
*Kuśa-blade*;—the term ‘*pavitra*’ being used in the sense of *Kuśa
grass*.

‘*Having presented*,’— offered—water to the Brāhmaṇas, and being
permitted by them, one should offer libations into fire. The
construction is—‘*brāhmaṇaiḥ anujñātaḥ kuryāt*.’

‘*Collectively*’—*i.e*., all the Brāhmaṇas should give the permission
together.

This necessity of obtaining permission implies also the use of some
words to be addressed in seeking the permission; they could not grant
the permission without being asked for it. From this it follows that the
words to be used should be such as—‘May I make the offering into fire,’
‘I shall make it,’ and so forth. The use of words for according the
permission is also hereby implied. All this should be done by means of
correct forms, of words; this has been shown by the authors of
*Gṛhyasūtras*—‘He should seek their permission with such words as, *May
I make the offering into fire*—*may I do it*; and they should say, *Yes
do it*.’— (210).

It is now described what is to be done in the Fire.

The Genitive in ‘*agneḥ*’ has the sense of the Dative;

Agni is one deity, and Soma-Yama conjointly form one conjunct deity;
just like Agni-Soma.

Of these two deities, ‘*having brought about at first, the
satisfaction*, *by the offering of sacrificial food, he should
afterwards satisfy the Pitṛs*.’ That is, he should offer balls of food
and feed the Brāhmaṇas.

In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, other deities have been prescribed; so that the
deities mentioned in the present text are for those who have no
*Gṛhyasūtra* of their own.

‘*Satisfaction*’ *stands* for *sustenance*. That gods are sustained by
sacrificial food, is a laudatory exaggertion.—(211).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1353), which adds the
following notes:—The meaning is that ‘after having made offerings to (1)
Agni, (2) Soma and (3) Yama, one should satisfy the Fathers who are
present in the person of the invited Brāhmaṇas’;—according to the
explanation given by Medhātithi and Harihara, we have only two deities
here—(1) Agni and (2) the joint deity Soma-Yama; and the genitive ending
in ‘*agneḥ*’ has the sense of the Dative, and this conjoint deity is to
be accepted only by those in whose *Gṛhya* such a joint deity is
mentioned. Our view is that the two, Soma and Yama, are to be treated
separately, not jointly, as is clear from the reading
‘*agnisomayamānāñca*’ adopted by some *Nibandhas*.

<details><summary><h4>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः ...{Loading}...</h4></summary>

The present text lays down an injunction in connection with those cases
where there is no fire, *i.e*., neither one set up according to
‘*smārta*’ rites, nor that kindled at marriage, nor that set up after
succession. As for the ordinary fire, since sacrificing to the Pitṛs in
such fire has been prohibited, there need be no consideration of the
presence or absence of such fire. It is going to be said later on (verse
282) that—‘oblations in connection with the offering to the Pitṛs should
not be offered in the ordinary fire.’

*Question*—“How can there be any possibility of the said Fire being
absent?”

*Answer*—It has been laid down that when a man is away from home and
without his Fire, if he happen to come by a desirable place, the proper
materials and the right type of Brāhmaṇas, he shall regard this as a
suitable opportunity for offering *Śrāddha*; and it is not that the
moonless day is the only one on which *Śrāddha* is to be performed.
Hence the present rule is meant for the man who, when out on a journey,
comes by a ‘sanctifier of company,’ or finds such suitable materials as
the ‘*Kālaśāka*,’ and the like.

“How can one away from home be entitled to the performance of
*Śrāddhas*? If the wife is also with him, away from home, then the Fire
also should be with them; since it is not considered desirable for the
Fire to be separated from both the sacrificer and his wife. It has been
declared that—‘for people away from home, the Fire shall not be
separated.’ If the Householder should happen to go out alone, then there
may be ‘absence of Fire;’ but the man is entitled to make offerings only
when associated with his wife; so that, when the wife is not near him,
her acquiescence being not available, how could there be any possibility
of the man making use of materials belonging to both? In the case of a
material belonging to both, there can be no giving away, in the absence
of the desire of either party. Against this it might be argued that—‘by
the line of reasoning just put forward, it would be impossible to
perform *Śrāddhas* in sacred places (during pilgrimages); and such
non-performance would be contrary to such declarations as—‘at Puṣkara
the Śrāddha is inexhaustible, austerity is highly meritorious; the same
is to be held regarding the Ocean and Prabhāsa.’ There is no force in
this; as such performance would be quite possible for the man who has
set up the Fire, when he goes out on pilgrimage along with his wife. In
the case in question, however, since the man would be journeying with
his wife, the Fire could not be absent. If, however, the man he
journeying alone, then, since he would be ignorant of his wife’s wishes
in the matter, he could not be entitled to the performance.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—When a man is proceeding on a
journey, he seeks his wife’s permission in the following words—‘I shall
be spending our belongings over religious performances;’ and having
obtained this permission, he could be entitled to the performance of
*Śrāddhas*.

Or, the rule laid down in the present text might pertain to boys before
their initiation, at which time the Fire has not been set up; and the
uninitiated boy also is entitled to the performance of *Śrāddha*, as has
been shown under the text where it has been declared that the boy is not
entitled to any rite, *except the offering of Śrāddhas*. Further, for
the Accomplished Student also, if his father happens to die before his
marriage, there would be ‘absence of fire.’

“In the Kāṭhaka, it is found stated that, on the death of the master of
the house, fire should be set up (by his successor),”

This should be taken as applying to one who has married, and not to one
who has merely just completed his studies. Two points of time have been
laid down for the setting up of the ‘*Smārta*’ Fire—on marriage and on
succession. So that, if one has not set up the Fire on marriage,—either
because he does not set up a separate household apart from his father,
or because he continues to live with his elder brother, according to the
law that ‘for brothers that have not separated there is a common
religious rite,’—for such a person, there is the other point of time, on
*succession*, according to the injunction—‘or, from the time of
succession;’ and the ‘time of succession’ is just the time when the
Father dies. And it is to such cases that the following declarations
apply,—‘having become pure, one should make offerings to the Pitṛs,’
‘one should bring fire from the fryer’s pan and then keep vigil,’ and so
forth. The setting up of the Fire mentioned in these texts (referring to
the Fire kindled for the day only) could not be regarded as an essential
factor in *Śrāddha*; for, if it were so, then, before the kindling of
this Fire, since the Fire would not be there, no *Śrāddha* could be
performed. Nor, again, is it possible that such a fire (set up for a
temporary purpose) should not be abandoned. It has been declared that
‘this is the Aupasada Fire, in which the culinary offerings have to be
made;’ and to the culinary offerings also a man without a wife is not
entitled; because of such injunctions as ‘the butter is examined by the
wife,’ ‘the wife should keep the observances,’ and so forth. It will not
be right to argue that—“this keeping of observances and the examining of
the butter are meant to apply to cases where the wife is
present;”—because both these acts have been enjoined as entirely
obligatory. Hence the meaning comes to be that libations are to be
poured into the ‘Aupasada’ fire.

“The father’s death is not the precise time of *succession*; since it
has been declared that the sons shall divide the property, after having
performed the *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa Śrāddha* (which is done one year after
death).”

The time herein mentioned is that for *division*, nut *succession*. In
fact, for division also there is no such absolute rule that it must be
done after the *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*; as it has been declared that ‘separation
among brothers is in view of religious rites;’ and the act of separation
becomes ‘religious,’ when the members separating severally perform
*Śrāddhas* and entertain guests, and so forth. Nor will it be right to
argue that such assertions as ‘the sons shall offer the nine *Śrāddhas*
conjointly’—refers to persons who have finished their studies. Because
it may be that a man, having acquired only a little learning, marries a
wife with a view to guard himself against transgressing the rule of
having intercourse with one’s own wife, to which he would be prone by
excess of sexual desire; but having married, be might devote greater
attention to the studies he had begun, and thus complete his studies
within a year, And it is with reference to such cases that we have the
rule regarding the sons dividing their property after having performed
the *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*.

Then again, when a man has lost a wife and is going to marry another,
till he has married again, there would be ‘absence of fire.’ Specially
because, in view of the general law that ‘one should make sacrificial
offerings in the company of his wife,’ which shows that there can be no
setting up of fire for one who has not married.

Such being the case, when Fire is absent, one should place the oblations
in the hands of the Brāhmaṇa—“Of which Brāhmaṇa?”—Of one of those that
have been invited; either of one who has been invited in honour of the
gods, or of some other invited Brāhmaṇa.

As a laudatory description, we have the words—‘*what the Fire is*, &c.’

This is the opinion of those ‘seers of mantras’ who know their
meanings.—(212).

*Medhātithi* (P. 274, l. 19)—‘*Dvau hi kālau etc*.’—See Gautama 5.
7—‘*Bhāryādiragnirdāyādirvā*.’

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 581) as
laying down the offering of *Homa* into the hand of the Brāhmaṇa. In
this connection it enters into a long discussion. The text speaks of the
‘absence of fire the ‘fire’ meant here must be the *Śrauta* and *Gṛhya*
fires. *Absence* again is of three kinds: ‘previous absence,’
‘destruction,’ and ‘absolute absence there is ‘previous absence’ of fire
prior to one’s entering the ‘Household’;—after the man has entered the
Household, if the fire goes out, either through carelessness, or through
the break up of the Household, there is ‘destruction’ of fire, which can
be resusciated by being set up again, or by the resumption of the
Household;—there is ‘absolute absence’ of fire in the case of the
Life-long Student, who never marries, and therefore never sets up either
the *Śrauta* (Sacrificial) or the *Gṛhya* (Domestic) fire. It is only in
the case of the first two kinds of ‘absence’ of the

Sacrificial and Domestic fires, that it being impossible to set up the
Fire at the time of offering the *Śrāddha*, the *Homa* should be offered
into the hands and such other receptacles as have been prescribed.—Some
people have held that *Homa* can be offered into the *ordinary* fire
also; but according to this view there could be no ‘absence of fire,’ as
the *ordinary fire* can always be set up without difficulty; so that
there would be no occasion for advantage being taken of the permission
to offer the *Homa* into the hand or other receptacles; and this would
render the present text, and others similar to it, entirely futile. All
this points to the conclusion that the Homa at Śrāddha should never be
offered into the *ordinary* fire.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 739) quotes this half of the verse, and
remarks that it refers only to the case of the *Homas* offered by a
Student

It is quoted also in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.237) in support of the view that
the offering of *Homa* into the hand is meant to apply only to the
Case—(1) of the *Śrāddhas* prescribed for the purpose of attaining a
definite end, such as the one laid down to be performed under such lunar
asterisms as *Kṛttikā* and the rest, for the purpose of attaining
heaven,—(2) of the *Ābhyudayika Śrāddha* laid down to be performed on
the occasion of the son’s marriage and such other ceremonies,—(3) of the
*Aṣṭakā Śrāddha*, laid down to be performed on the eighth day of the
month,—and (4) of the *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa Śrāddha*.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 316).

The whole verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1337), which has the
following ṅotes:—The second line is a *Hetuvannigada Arthavāda*, the
Brāhanaṇa being eulogised as serving the same purposes as the fire into
which libations are poured,—‘*mantradarśibhiḥ*’, ‘by those learned in
the Veda.’

*Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtra* (4.8.5-6).—‘If permitted, then, it may be

being the mouth of the Pitṛs,—so says the Brāhmaṇa-text.’

*Jātūkarṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 739).—‘In the absence of the fire, it

the fire shall offer oblations into the fire; and at the latter four, in
the hands of the Brāhmaṇas invited for the sake of the Pitṛs.’

This is a purely laudatory declaration; and it makes the Brāhmaṇas
attain the dignity of gods. \[The sense being\]—Agni (Fire) is a god,
and when a libation is poured into the Fire, the gods eat it, through
the Fire as their mouth; the *Brāhmaṇas* also have the same character;
and whatever is placed in their hands, that also the gods eat.

“What is that character of the gods, by virtue of which the Brāhmaṇas
are spoken of as having the same character?”

It is in answer to this that the text adds—‘*free* *from anger* &c.’ As
regards the question why they are so described, the explanation is that
what is meant is that the libations of butter should be offered into the
hands of such Brāhmaṇas as are endowed with the character here
described.

Others have explained that in a foregoing verse (192),

‘*freedom from anger*’ and the rest have been laid down as the qualities
to be sought for those invited in honour of the Pitṛs and who were meant
to be eulogised,—while the present text lays down these as to be sought
for in those, invited in honour of the gods. This is the difference
between the two texts. It is in this sense that they have been described
as ‘*the gods of śrāddha*.’

‘*Ancients*’—*i.e*., the sages.

Or, we may read the term ‘*purātana*’ with the accusative ending;
‘ancient’ (in this case) qualifying ‘*gods*;’—the ‘ancient gods’
standing for those deities born in this cycle who are called
‘*sādhyas*.’

‘*Intent upon sustaining the universe*,’—*i.e*., it is with a view to
gratifying people that they eat at *śrāddhas*; hence one should not
think that ‘these men are eating through greediness, and for the purpose
of obtaining the perceptible pleasure (of eating tasty food), and hence
why should any honour be rendered to them?’ Because these men sustain
the universe,—*i.e*., the Earth, the Sky and the Heaven; therefore, they
should not be treated with disrespect.—(213)

*Sādhyas*’ (Medhātithi, who adopts this reading only as an alternative,

construed as nominative to the verb ‘*vadanti*’);—‘Those whose
succession has been uninterrupted since immemorial times’ (Govindarāja,

What is done in fire, in the form of pouring the libation, with the
words, ‘*agnaye svadhā namaḥ*’ (‘this is an offering for Agni,’) should
be done in the ‘*apasavya*’ form.

Some people explain the term ‘*apasavya*’ to mean that the act should be
done with the right hand, not with the left, nor by both; in view of the
prohibition contained in verse 225 below. This, according to these
people, has been added, in view of it being thought possible to do the
act with both hands.

This, however, is not right. Because the ‘*apasavya form*’ here enjoined
is in reference to the ‘serial performance’ of those libations that are
poured into Fire; hence, what is meant is that the libations should be
poured in such a manner that they tend *towards the South, not towards
the North*;—this latter being what is right in the case of offerings to
the gods. That is to say, when the sacrificial material is being poured
with the ladle, one should be facing the South, and not the North—this
rule standing on the same footing as that which prescribes the pouring
of water-libations to the Pitṛs in such a manner that it flows between
the thumb and the index-finger.

The epithet ‘*entire*’ indicates that all such acts as the placing of
the material in the dish, and so forth, should be done in the
‘*apasavya*’ form.

‘*He should offer water with the hand in the apasavya position*,’

‘*Śanaiḥ*’ (for ‘*bhuvi*’) is another reading.

The purpose of this rule is that it has been emphasised with a view to
preclude the use of silver implements (according to 202).

‘*Āvṛt*’ stands for ‘*Āvṛtti*,’ ‘repetition.’—(214)

‘*Apasavyam*’—‘In such a manner that they tend towards the South’
(Medhātithi);—‘Passing the sacrificial thread over the right shoulder
under the left arm’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘with the right hand’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi, which he rejects).

‘*Āpasavyena hastena*’—‘With the right hand’ (Kullūka). This
explanation, which Buhler wrongly attributes to ‘others’ (in
Medhātithi), is really put forth by Medhātithi in connection with the
former term ‘*Apasavyam*’, and not the second expression ‘*Āpasavyena
hastena*.’ Nor is it right to say that according to Medhātithi this
second expression means ‘out of the Tīrtha of the right hand which is
sacred to the Manes’; because, as a matter of fact, Medhātithi has given
no explanation of this expression at all. Buhler seems to have got an
imperfect copy of Medhātithi; or did he not pay careful attention to
reading it?

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601) without any
comment;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1321) as distinctly laying down
the ‘*Prācīnāvīta*’.

From out of the material that had been held in the vessel, and out of
which the fire-oblations have been offered,—‘*having made three bails*,’
turning bis face towards the South, he should ‘*offer them*’—*i.e*.,
throw them on the *kuśa-grass*, with reference to the Pitṛs.

The term ‘*piṇḍa*,’ ‘ball,’ stands for something *solid*; hence, one
should not, in this connection, offer disintegrated articles of food.

‘*In the manner of the water-libations*’—*i.e*., the manner of offering
water-libations, which has been just pointed out (in the preceding
verse).

In this connection, the following question arises:—“Should the
purificatory rites necessary for the sacrificial material be performed
over the substance taken out of the food that has been cooked for
feeding the Brāhmaṇas?—or, should separate rice be cooked?—and also what
should be the quantity of that sacrificial material? The rule laying
down ‘four handfulls’ cannot apply to this case.”

This question has been already discussed; in the absence of any specific
rules on the subject, one is free to do what one likes; and the quantity
should be just what may be necessary for the purpose in view.

Inasmuch as ‘the manner of the water-libations’ is laid down as
applicable to the offering of balls, it follows that this latter
offering is to be done with ‘hands in the *apasavya* position,’ and not
with silver implements.

‘*With collected mind*’—this has been added for the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(215)

‘*Nyupya*’—‘having offered,’—‘*on kuśa-blades*’—he should wipe that hand
*on those* same kuśa-blades,—those same on which the balls have been
offered.

In accordance with the opinion of other *Smṛtis*, the wiping is to be
done on the root-end of the kuśa-blades.

Others have held that this rule does not mean simply that the food and
water attaching to the hand should be so wiped; in fact, even though
nothing may be attached to the hand, yet even the hand itself should be
wiped on the blades. The reason for this is that the act here prescribed
is not in the nature of the ‘disposal of remnants,’ in which case alone
it could he held to be done only when the stated conditions would be
present. Specially as what is prescribed is, not that ‘one should wipe
*what is attaching to the hand*,’ but that ‘he should wipe the *hand*.’

Against this it might be argued that—“we find it stated that the act is
‘for the sake of the Partakers of Smearings,’ which shows that it cannot
be done when there is no ‘smearing’ at all. Why, then, should it be said
that, even when there is nothing sticking to the hand, the act should be
done?”

The answer to this is as follows:—It is possible that solid food may not
stick to the hand; but when the ball of food is being rolled up, the
juices of the food are sure to stick to the hand, by reason of the
contact with heat; and it is this that is called the ‘*smearing*.’

The genitive ending in ‘*lepabhāginām*’ connotes the connection of the
act of *wiping* with the particular class of Pitṛs. Any such beings as
‘Partakers of Smearings’ are not visible to the eye; hence it is not
possible to bring about their ‘possession’ in connection with the
‘smearing.’ Hence, all that is meant is that ‘one should think in his
mind that the smearing is meant to be the share of the ‘Partakers of
Smearings;’ or, he may even say this in so many words.

Others have held that ancestors above the great grandfather are spoken
of as ‘Partakers of Smearings.’ According to this view, if the names of
those ancestors are not pronounced, they may be referred to by means of
such expressions as ‘this to the father of my great-grandfather,’ ‘this
to the grandfather of my great-grandfather,’ and so forth.

The singular number in ‘*hand*’ shows that the ball is to be offered
with a single hand in the ‘*apasavya*’ form.

‘*Self-controlled*’—this is a mere reiteration: such control having been
already prescribed above.

‘*According to rule*’—refers to the rules of procedure laid down in
other scriptures; *e.g*., Śaṅkha says—‘One should offer the ball along
with sandal-paint, garlands, incense, doth and dressings.’ The ‘rule’
that has been prescribed in the text by Manu himself has been stated in
his own words; hence the phrase, ‘according to rule,’ would be
meaningless (if it referred to that rule itself). It is for this reason
that this phrase should be taken as summing up the details prescribed in
other scriptures.—(216).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601), without comment;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 754) as laying down what should be done
after the offering of the Balls has been made;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
177), which explains that the ‘*Lepabhāginaḥ*,’ ‘Partakers of smearings’
are the ancestors, the great-great-grandfather, his father and his
grandfather;—one’s own father, grandfather and great-grandfather being
called ‘*pīṇḍabhāginaḥ*’;—the same explanation is repeated by the same
work on p. 239.

It is evidently a misprint in Buhler’s note where he includes the
‘great-grandfather’ under the ‘*lepabhāginaḥ*’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 507);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1449), which has the following notes:—‘*Nyupya*’, having deposited on
the kuśa-grass,—‘*prayataḥ*’ with proper care,—such care as implies
concentration of mind, freedom from forgetfulness and so forth; in fact
it stands for the entire procedure,—‘*vidhipūrvakam*’ refers to rules
prescribed in ordinances other than those of Manu himself,—‘*teṣu
darbheṣu*’, those kuśa-blades upon which the Balls have been
deposited,—‘*tam*’, that hand by which the Ball has been
offered—‘*lepabhāginaḥ*’ *i.e*., intended for those Pitṛs who are
entitled to the ‘smearings’ *i*. *e*., the four ancestors, above the
great-grandfather;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 190).

Having placed the balls on the kuśa-grass, he should turn towards the
North, leftwards; since we read in another *Smṛti*—‘turning to the left,
towards the north.’

Seated with his face towards the North, he should sip water. ‘*Having
sipped water*’— he should perform ‘breath-suppression’ three times;
*e.g*., simply supressing the breath three times—only this much;—the
rule relating to the repeating of the *Gāyatrī* verse along with the
‘*Śiras*’ formula (Yājña. *Ācāra* 23) not applying to the present case.

‘*Gently*’—so that there may not he much pain. This is what has been
asserted (elsewhere) in the words—‘having suppressed the breathing as
much as one can.’

Still facing the North, he should salute, &c., &c.—saying, ‘Salutation
to the spring!’ and so forth.

He should also salute the Pitṛs; ‘*with proper formulas* with the
*mantra*, ‘*Na* *mo vaḥ pitaraḥ*, &c., &c.’ This saluting of the Pitṛs
should be done with face turned towards the Balls; for another *Smṛti*
says that this is to be done by ‘turning round.’—(217).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 241), which explains the word
‘*mantravat*’ (the reading adopted by it, along with Medhātithi, in
place of ‘*mantravit*’), as referring to the *Yajurveda-text*—‘*namo vaḥ
pitaro rasāya—namo vaḥ pitaraḥ śoṣāya—namo vaḥ pitaro jīvāya—namo vaḥ
pitaraḥ svadhāyai—namo vaḥ pitaro ghorāya—namo vaḥ pitaro manyave*,’
where, according to Halāyudha, the six
names—‘Rasa—Śoṣa—Jīva—Svadhā—Ghora—and Manyu’—stand respectively for the
six seasons—Spring, Summer, Rains, Autumn, Pre-winter and Mid-winter;
and what is meant is that these should be thought of as ‘Pitṛs’ and then
saluted.—It further adds that as no such ‘salutation to the Seasons’ is
spoken of in Gobhila’s *Gṛhyasūtra*, what Manu says should be taken as
applying to Brāhmaṇas other than those who belong to the Sāmaveda.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 601) also quotes this verse, and adds that the
salutation to the Seasons is to be made with the *mantra*—‘*namo vaḥ
pitaraḥ &c*., *&c*.’

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 328) quotes this verse, and adds that Medhātithi has
explained the phrase ‘*trirāyamya asūn*’ as ‘*triḥ prāṇāyāmam kṛtvā*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 507);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1451) to
the effect that the sipping of water should be done after the washing of
the hand;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 193), which adds that the
mantra for bowing to the seasons begins with ‘*vasantāya*’ and that for
saluting the Pitṛs, with ‘*amīmadanta*.’

Water should be poured again near the balls, out of the same vessel from
which it had been poured upon the kuśa-blades, before the offering or
the balls.

‘*Remaining*’;—this is meant to show that, the net mentioned is to be
regarded as the ‘disposal of remnants;’ it is only in this sense that
the term ‘*remaining*’ becomes justifiable. From this it follows that,
in the event of there being no ‘remnant,’ there shall be no ‘pouring.’
But in the *Gṛhyasūtra*, it has been declared that this ‘pouring of
water’ is obligatory.

‘*He should smell these balls*;’—‘*smelling*,’ consists of *eeling the
odour*; but in the *Gṛhyasūtra* it is said that ‘he should *eat* it with
his breath.’

‘*in the order in which they were offered*,’—the order in which they
were offered being, *first* to the father, *second* to the grandfather,
and *third* to the great-grandfather;—‘*with collected mind*’—this is
for filling up the metre.—(218.)

Extremely small portions—parts of the ball offered to the Father should
be made to be eaten by the Brāhmaṇa who has been previously seated in
honour of the Father.

‘*In due order of sequence*’;—the meaning of this has been already
explained.

The pronoun ‘those’ refers to those mentiond in the present context;
and, it is in view of this that, in 212, our author has not thought it
necessary to specify the Brāhmaṇa as the one thus mentioned.

It has been said that ‘one shall offer balls to the Pitṛs.’ Now the
question arises—Who are these ‘*Pitṛs?*’ The term ‘*pitṛ*’ has several
meanings, and denotes ‘progenitor’; (A) it is used in the sense of the
relative term, ‘father’; (B) it is also used in the sense of one’s
father and other relations that have died before. It is in this latter
sense that we have the term used in the *plural* in all such
*Nigada-mantras* as ‘*namo vaḥ pitaraḥ*, &c.’. It is for the same
reason, again, that at the Śrāddha offered to females, these mantras do
not undergo transmutation into the form ‘*namo vo mātaraḥ*, &c.’ on the
same grounds, again, at the the *Śrāddha* offered to a single person, it
is only the *number* that is changed, not the *basic noun* (pitṛ). Says
the author of the *Sutra* also—‘Mantras should be transformed only in
regard to the singular number;’ the transformed words being—‘*namaste
pitaḥ*.’ Similarly, he who performs the unitary Śrāddha of his brother
or grandfather, uses the *mantra* in the form ‘*namaste bhrātaḥ*,’
‘*namaste pitāmaha*,’ ‘*namaste pitṛvya*,’ and so forth. The offering of
*Śrāddha* to one’s childless uncle has been enjoined as necessary, in
such passages as—‘what one receives from another that he shall give unto
him.’ (C) Further, the term ‘*pitṛ*’ also denotes a particular Deity;
and in this sense, it would stand for an unchanging eternal being. In
fact, the author of the *Nirukta*, in the Daivata Section of the work,
gives the name ‘*Pitṛ*,’ to the divine Beings occupying the Middle
Regions, describing them as ‘*Pitṛs*, the Maruts bearing the rosary of
beads.’

The term ‘*pitṛ*,’ thus having several meanings, the Text proceeds to
specify what is meant by it in the present context.

‘*While his father holds*,’—is alive—‘*one should make the offering to
the previous ancestors*,’—‘*i.e*., to the three, the grandfather, the
great-grandfather and the father of the latter; that these three are
meant is indicated by the plural number. Says the *Gṛhyasūtra*—‘The son
should offer to those to whom the father offers, if both father and son
are persons who have set up the fire.’

“But they say that the ball does not reach the fourth ancestor.”

True; but, in the case in question, no *fourth* ball is offered.

The text provides another alternative course to be adopted—‘*As a
Brāhmaṇa*, etc.’ That is, Brāhmaṇas, Religious Students and Ascetics are
invited and honoured and worship-pod and fed; and exactly in the same
manner should the father be honoured and fed by one whose father is
still alive ‘*at the Śrāddha*,’—*i.e*., the food cooked for the
*Śrāddha* offerings.

In this case, the fact of the man being his father, is the sole ground
for his being fed; hence it is not necessary to look into his caste and
qualifications. To this end they declare thus:—‘The *Śrāddha* is for the
purpose of giving pleasure to one’s ancestors’;—hence the bringing about
of the pleasure of the dead father being necessary, what harm would
there be in feeding the living father, in view of which he could not be
fed?

‘*Own*’—Is merely reiterative; what is denoted by this being already
connoted by the relative term, ‘father,’ itself.

What is laid down here is the actual *feeding* of the Father; but the
Balls are placed for the Pitṛs on *Kuśa* blades; as otherwise, there
would be an incompatibility with the formula ‘this ball is for you.’ If
the Kusba-blades be regarded as substitutes for the Dish, then, in the
event of the living Father’s possession being brought about (by the act
of offering), it would not be right to make him eat ‘a very small
portion;’ because, for the living person, the eating is to be in
accordance with the eater’s desire. Further, in this case, there would
be no need of pouring water and other things over the ball offered; as
such a process would lead to the undesirable contingency of a ‘hybrid
performance;’ any effect produced by the pouring of water, in this case,
would serve no useful purpose, cither for the man himself or for his
father; so that it could only serve an imperceptible transcendental
purpose; on the other hand, if water were not poured over the ball, it
might be fit for being eaten either by the father, or by the offerer
himself, or by some one else. It is in this way that the act may turn
out to be of a ‘hybrid’ character.

For these reasons, it follows that, in this alternative, the *ball* is
to be offered to only two persons, the grandfather and the
great-grandfather.

The authors of the Gṛhyasūtras, however, declare that—‘for one whose
father is alive there is neiher *Piṇḍapitṛyajña*, nor *Śrāddha*;—there
is either non-performance of these rites, or their performance only up
to the stage of pouring libations into fire.’—(220)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 542), which explains
‘*pūrveṣām*’ as ‘the three beginning with the grandfather’. Hopkins is
not right when he says that “in this case he offers of course only two
Balls.”

The first half is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 361), in support of the
view that the Ball should be offered to the Father’s father, grandfather
and great-grandfather.

The verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 553), which has the
following notes;—‘*Pūrveṣām*,’ the *father’s* forefathers; another
alternative is that the living Father should be respectfully fed and
then Śrāddha offered to the next two ancestors, *i.e*., the grandfather
and the greatgrandfather.

It has been said above (219) that—‘he shall make them eat very small
portions of the balls;’ and the present text lays down the time for this
feeding—and the place (from which the portion is to be drawn). The
portion is to be taken from the top of the ball; and this portion of the
ball should be offered after the Kuśa-blades and water and sesamum have
been offered.

‘*Saying—May this be svadhā to these*.’ The pronoun ‘these’ stands for
the individual names; the construction being—‘having pronounced the
names of the particular ancestor, he should say, *May this be svadhā to
him*.’ In this sense, the Dative should be used in connection with the
term ‘*svadhā*,’—the right form being—‘*svadhā Devadattaya astu*,’
‘*svadhā Yajñadattāya astu*,’ ‘may this be *svadhā to* Devadatta,’ ‘may
this be *svadhā* to Yajñadatta,’ and so forth.

By explaining our text thus, we do not run counter to other scriptural
injunctions.—(223)

With both hands he should himself take up ‘*the supply of
food*,’—*i.e*., the dish supplied with food,—from the kitchen-house, to
the place where the Brāhmaṇas are being fed, and—‘*place it near the
Brāhmaṇas*.’

Others explain the verse as follows:—The term ‘*vardhitam*,’ ‘*supply*,’
stands for the *massed food*; this he should place before the Brāhmaṇas,
‘thinking of his *Pitṛs*’—*i.e*., in his mind saying, ‘this is for
you’—he should scatter the food.

This is not right. Later on (228), our author is going to declare that
‘having brought up the food, he should serve it all;’ hence the
‘*placing*’ mentioned in the present verse must simply mean the bringing
of the food from another place and depositing it near the
Brāhmaṇas.—(224)

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1368), which has the
following notes:—‘*Annasya vardhitam*’, ‘pot filled with food’, should
be brought from the kitchen, with both hands, and placed before the
Brāhmaṇa, in a clean place,—‘*śanakaiḥ*’ gently, so that the pot does
not break or make any sound,—‘*Svayam*’, himself,—this is the best
course; other Smṛti texts permit of the cooking etc. being done by the
wife;—in ‘*Śrādhakriyākaumudī* (p. 158), which explains ‘*vardhitam*’ a
s ‘filled’;—it adds that the man should himself place the vessel near
the Brāhmaṇa on the square platform made for that purpose and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 545), which explains ‘*annasya*’ as
‘*annena*’ and ‘*vardhitam*’ as ‘filled’.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 229), which adds the following
notes:—The genitive ending in ‘*annasya*’ has the sense of the
instrumental;—‘*vardhitam*’ means ‘filled’, which qualifies the
‘*pātra*, receptacle’ understood;—‘*upanikṣipet*’—keep near, for
serving; *i*. *e*., the food should not be served into the dish directly
from the cooking-pot; the cooking pot should be brought near the dish,
and placed on the ground; the food should be served on the dish with the
two hands, with which another vessel is held.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 492), which adds the explanation that
‘the man should carry with his own hands the vessel which has been
filled with food in a place other than the one where the Brāhmaṇas are
to be fed, to a place near the Brāhmaṇas and keep it there gently, all
the time thinking of his Pitṛs’;—‘*annasya vardhitam*’ meaning that
quantity of food which has been set aside as the share of one feeder.

The food should be *fetched* and *served* with both hands, not with one
hand, *serving* also being a kind of *fetching*; hence, the rule laid
down in connection with the latter is applicable to the former also. In
support of this, the present verse supplies a commendatory supplement.

That which is ‘*abandoned*’—not held—‘*by both hands*,’ such food, when
brought up for serving,—the ‘*demons destroy*’
‘*forcibly*,’—‘*wicked-minded*’—of malevolent nature;—‘*demons*’ *i.e*.,
the enemies of gods.

In ‘*ubhayoḥ*,’ ‘*both*,’ the Locative ending denotes location; and
‘*abandoned*’ means *not held*. As a matter of fact, case-endings are
used even when what is spoken of is the *negation* of what is denoted by
the ending; *e.g*., we have such expressions as ‘he does *not come from
the village*,’ ‘he does *not sit on the seat*,’ ‘he does *not fast for
three dags*.’ \[Similarly, in the text though *negation of holding* is
mentioned, yet we have the Locative ending denoting location\].—(225)

wicked-minded Asuras keep in waiting for the interval between the two
hands.’

*Maṭysapurāṇa* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 2370).—‘He
shall bring up the food, with both hands, then serve it, with a calm
mind, keeping in his hand water and kuśa.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p.

of iron, nor by one who is without the Pavitra and the kuśa, nor with

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 229), which explains ‘*guṇān*’
as ‘accessories’,—and ‘*bhūmāveva*’ as meaning that the dish containing
the curries should be put on the ground, and the curries should not be
served on the dish out of which the food is eaten; but the curry may be
served on this latter in the absence of a second dish.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 493), which explains ‘*guṇān*’ as
‘vegetable and other accessories,’ which are further specified as
‘*sūpa-śāka*’ and the rest; these should be served in vessels placed on
the ground, and in those placed in another vessel;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1372), which adds the following notes—‘*Bhūmau*’, in
vessels placed on the ground,—‘*guṇān*’, things called ‘*guṇa*’,
‘accessory’,—viz., ‘*sūpa-śāka* &c.’; ‘*sūpa*’ is a special preparation
of *Mudga* and other grains cooked with rice, and culled ‘*barānna*’,
and ‘*śāka*’ for cooked roots, fruits, leaves etc.; the particle ‘*ca*’
includes other rich kinds of food, milk-rice, cakes, and so forth;—in
*Śrāddhakaumudī* (p. 158), which explains ‘*guṇān*’ as subsidiary
articles of food,—‘*bhūmau*’ as ‘not on the feeding-dish itself *i*.
*e*., in other dishes placed near the feeding dish;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhali* (Kāla, p. 545).

‘*Having brought* *up*’—having presented before the Brāhmaṇas,—‘*he
shall serve it*’—which means the placing of it in the dish in which the
person eats. Though all that is meant by ‘serving’ is the placing of the
food within reach of the diner,—yet this placing should be done in such
a way that among the several persons dining, the articles of food shall
not flow from one man’s dish into another’s.

‘*Qualities*,’—*i.e*., those qualities of the Hard and Soft food, which
consist of acidity, etc.,—these he should describe, saying—‘this is
acid—this is sweet,—this is a pastry’ and so forth. When they have been
thus apprised, ‘he should give them whatever they relish most’—this has
to be construed from what follows later on (in verse 231).

‘*Gently*’—this is a reiteration for filling up the metre.—(228)

‘*Asra*’ is tear; this he should not ‘*shed*’—drop. As a rule, during
the performance of *Śrāddha* in honour of the dead, one is apt to recall
the grief caused by the loss of the loved person, which leads to the
shedding of tears; and this is what is prohibited here; there is no harm
in the sudden dropping of the tears of joy.

‘*Never*’—on no account—shall he shed tears.

‘*He should not become angry*,’—should not take up an angry attitude.

The telling of a lie having been already prohibited with a view to the
fulfilment of man’s purpose in general, it is again prohibited here,
with a view to the due fulfilment of the act of *śrāddha*.

‘*He should not touch the food with his foot*’—any food, either in the
form of leavings or otherwise.

‘*He should not shake* *it*’—*i.e*., he shall not throw it by hand and
then again take it in.

Others have explained this verse to mean that he shall not shake a piece
of cloth over the food, as is often done for the removing of dust, etc.,
from it.—(229)

‘*Avadhūnayet*’—‘Shake; *i.e*., throw it by the hand and then take it
in’ (Medhātithi);—‘Shake a piece of cloth over the food, as is often
done for the removing of dust etc.’ (‘Others’ mentioned in Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1029), which explains the
meaning to be that ‘there should be no weeping’, and goes on to add—what
is forbidden is not the tear of joy (at the offering), but the tears
that may come to the eyes by reason of the death of the beloved
relative,—the telling of lies which has already been prohibited
elsewhere from moral considerations, is here forbidden as affecting the
performance of the offering;—one should not touch with his feet any kind
of food, whether, clean or unclean,—nor should cloth be shaken over the
food;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 161), which explains ‘*asram*’ as
tears of grief, and in regard to the ‘shaking of cloth’, it says that
some people explain it as *dusting the doth over the food*, while
according to others, what is forbidden is the fanning of the food with a
piece of cloth;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 549).

not hear ill-will towards those eating nor be jealous of them.’

*Devala* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1029).—‘At the Śrāddha,
people should not shed tears, nor converse, nor laugh among themselves,
nor wander about, nor be angry, nor be worried; even though there be
sufficient cause, one shall not utter words of anger; near the Pitṛs one
shall not sit either supported or perspiring.’

This verse is supplementary to what has gone before in the preceding
verse.

The shedding of tears, when done, makes the Śrāddha-offering go—*i.e*.,
sends it—to ‘*ghosts*’; and it does not become helpful to the Pitṛs. The
term ‘*preta*,’ ‘ghost,’ here stands for a particular class of beings,
of the same kind as *Piśācas*; and not. for persons recently dead and
not yet joined to their ancestors.

‘*Demons*’—also should be understood in the same manner as ‘ghosts.’

‘*Enemies*’—well-known.

‘*Sinners*’—People addicted to sinful deeds.—(230)

*Devala* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1030).—‘If there is some flaw
in cleanliness, Rākṣasas take away all that is sacrificed or offered or
given away or eaten, all *japa*, all austerities and all
learning;—similarly also what is given in anger, or what is eaten in
hurry, the Rākṣasas take away both these;—having invited the Pitṛs, one
shall do nothing that may be improper; therefore one shall perform the
Śrāddha with speech and anger under control;—one shall not be angry with
any one, even though there be cause for it; what pleases the Pitṛs is
the Śrāddha that is free from anger.’

Whatever food, vegetable or drink they may ask for,—all this he shall
give ‘*ungrudgingly*’—without the least hesitation or covetousness. The
term ‘*matsara*’ stands here for *avarice*.

‘*Be agreeable to*’—*i.e*., cause pleasure to.

‘*Told in the Veda*’—those that are related in the Veda; such, *e.g*.,
as the story of the war between the gods and demons, that of the death
of Vṛttra, the doings of Saramā, and so forth. Or, it may stand for such
stories as ‘*Kaḥ svidekākī charati*,’ etc. (Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, 23.9).

Another reading is ‘*brahmādyāśca kathāḥ*’—*i.e*., discourses, in
ordinary language, upon the meaning of mantras bearing upon Brahman.

‘*This is liked by the Pitṛs*;’—this is a commendatory supplement.—(231)

‘*Brahmodyāḥ kathāḥ*’—Buhler does not represent Medhātithi quite
rightly: The explanation that he attributes to him, ‘riddles from the
Veda’, is not found in Medhātithi at all. Medhātithi’s *first*
explanation is—‘stories related in the Veda’;—the *second* alternative
proposed is ‘such Vedic texts as the one contained in 23.9 of the
Vājasaneya Saṃhitā’;—and the third explanation, ‘discourses, inordinary
language, on the meaning of Mantras bearing upon Brāhmaṇ’, is offered as
that of the reading ‘*Brahmodyāḥ kathāḥ*’. It will thus be seen that
‘riddles from the Veda’ are not found in Medhātithi at all. It is the
third explanation apparently that has misled Buhler. Hopkins has quoted
Medhātithi correctly.

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 546);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 158);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1027),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Brahmodyāḥ*’, stories that are related
by the Brāhmaṇa, such as accounts of the war between the Gods and the
Asuras, of the killing of Vṛttra, of Saramā and so forth,—or it may
refer to such texts as ‘*Kaścidekāki charati* etc.’; ‘*Brahmādyāḥ*’ is
another reading, which means—‘Those mantras and Arthavāda texts which
deal with Brahman’; ‘*Kathāḥ*’, conversations in the ordinary language
should be carried on, in connection with the said subjects;—‘*this is
liked by the Pitṛs*’—this is *Arthavāda*.

*Yājñavalkya* (1.240).—‘Free from anger and without hurry, one shall
offer such food as may be desired and *pure*—reciting the *Pavitra*
mantras till complete satisfaction.’

*Laghu-Āśvalāyana* (23.68).—‘After the Brāhmaṇas have eaten to their
heart’s content, he shall pronounce the Gāyatrī.’

*Varūha-purāṇa* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1388).—‘The offerer
having offered food, clean, profuse and carefully prepared,—he should
politely say —*please fall* *to*.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 423).—‘So long as the food is pure, so long
as what is desired is offered, and so long as the offerer does not say
*I give*,—so long do the Pitṛs partake of the food.’

*Sumantu* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 424).—‘Without anger, he shall offer to
each such dishes as he may relish; they should be fed till they are
fully satisfied; and he shall not selfishly keep back any food.’

Even if he has cause for grief, he should not show it, by heaving a
sigh, or in any other way; in fact, he should show himself quite happy.

‘*He should bring delight to the Brāhmaṇas*’—by means of songs and such
things sung by other persons; or, by means of such jokes as may be not
improper and be in keeping with the occasion. If the reciting of Vedic
texts were continued unceasingly, the Brāhmaṇas might begin to feel
bored; hence, now and again, he should cease and amuse the guests by
means of music, etc.

‘*He should feed them gently*;’—he should make them eat by addressing to
them such agreeable words as ‘Do take a few morsels, this dish is nice;’
and this should be done ‘*gently*’—not in a hurried or pressing
tone;—‘*with dishes*’—such as milk-rice, and the like.

‘*By means of seasonings*,’—when the seasonings are taken up for being
served, he should describe them as very tasty and thereby tempt the
guests to eat; saying such words as—‘these cakes are delicious, this
preparation of milk is highly flavoured;’ and taking the things in hand
and standing before each guest, he shall say such words again and again.
This is what constitutes ‘urging.’—(233)

The propriety of feeding the daughter’s son is put forward here as a
substitute (for what has been enjoined in the preceding verses).

The ‘*Kutapa*’ is a piece of cloth of the shape of a blanket, and made
of the goat-wool; it is known among the Northerners as ‘*Kambala*’
(Blanket). This he should give as sent.

This does not apply to the case of the daughter’s son only, but to that
of all guests; that this is so, is shown by what is going to be said
regarding ‘three things being sacred at śrāddhas’ (next verse); which
shows that this is meant to apply to every kind of *śrāddha*.

‘*Scatter sesamum*’—on the ground.—(234)

‘*Kutapam*’—The commentators are agreed in explaining this as ‘blanket,’
The word also means ‘the hour of the day after half-past eleven, the
best suited for the offering of Śrāddhas.’ This meaning, however, is not
applicable to the present verse.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 475), which explains ‘*kutapa*’

‘*Atyuṣṇa*,’ ‘very hot,’ stands for ‘hot;’ the term being expounded as
‘*atigatam uṣṇam*,’ ‘with heat developed;’ just as ‘*praparṇa*’ stands
for ‘*prapatitaparṇa*,’ ‘that of which the leaves have fallen.’

‘*All*’—*i.e*., the food as well as the seasonings.

This injunction regarding ‘being hot’ applies to only those things which
ought to be eaten hot, and not to rice cooked in curd and such things,
which, when eaten hot, are disagreeable and harmful; and this would be
contrary to what has been said before regarding ‘bringing delight to the
Brāhmaṇas.’

In view of the injunction of eating hot food, the entire quantity should
not be served at once; as, in that case, for persons who eat much, it
would become cold. Hence, as the food is eaten little by little, more
should be given. It will not be right to argue that “the food out of
which a part has been served becomes a ‘remnant,’ and it would not be
right to serve it as such;” because the rule regarding feeding is that
the action of the eater extends till his complete satisfaction. Further,
the Rice and other things do not come in, in the act of feeding, as
‘gifts to be received;’ that is why there is no reciting of mantras
connected with the receiving of gifts, over the Rice and other articles
of food.

‘*With controlled speech*’—*i.e*., having their speech under full
control; the reversed order of the two terms of the compound is an
archaism. Or, the compound ‘*vāgyatāḥ*’ may be expounded as ‘*vacā
yatāḥ*,’ ‘controlled of speech;’ the compound in this case being in
accordance with Pāṇini’s aphorism, ‘*Sādhanam kṛtā*’; and, in this
sense, the term ‘*yataḥ*’ would have the sense of the active
past-participle. ‘Control’ means *stopping of operation*; and the
‘operation’ of ‘speech’ is *uttering of words*; and it is this latter
that is prohibited; the meaning being that no words, distinct or
indistinct, shall be uttered.

Nor are the qualities of the food to be described. It has been declared
that ‘excellent and well-behaved people, while taking food, shall not
speak to the giver.’

“This injunction is already implied by that relating to the control of
speech.”

True; what is meant by the second injunction is that it should not be
done by gestures even; the root ‘*brū*’ denotes *describing*; so that
the word ‘*brūyuḥ*’ does not necessarily mean *articulate
utterance*.—(236)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 748), which
explains that the addition of the particle ‘*eva*’ is meant to emphasise
that ‘they should not give up eating, even though they may happen to
touch one another.’

The second half of the verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 497);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 170), which says that this verse forbids the
praising of the food even by means of gestures;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 553), which adds the same note.

praise or decry the food. They should say nothing except by the gesture
of the hand. The Pitṛs partake of the food only so long as it is on the
ground, until it is praised, and so long as it is hot, except in the

‘*Wound up*’—with turban and such other things. The Northerners cover
their heads with cloth.

Some people explain that this refers also to persons who cover their
heads with their hairs Arranged in the form of a top-knot. Rut what they
say is not reasonable; as, in this case, it is the *hair* that is ‘wound
up,’ not the *head*; and the *hairs* do not form the *head*; in fact,
they are *on the head*. The prohibition does not apply to threads and
such things; as such things are not regarded as ‘covering’ the head.

What is meant by indicating the facing of the south as defective is
that, when there is want of space, eating with face towards all
directions *except the south* is permissible. If this were not meant,
where would there be any possibility of anyone eating with face to the
south, when it has been distinctly enjoined that one should eat facing
the north?

‘*Shoes*’—foot-guards made of leather. Some people explain this as
sandals of leather.

‘*The demons eat*,’—and not the Pitṛs.

This is deprecatory of the conditions described.—(238)

etc.;—the specific prohibition of facing the south implies that when
there is scarcity of room one may eat facing any other quarter but the
south,—‘*upānahau*’ are foot-covers of leather (shoes).

‘*Pig*’—the village-hog.

Though it has been declared that ‘these shall not *look* at dose
quarters,’ yet what the cultured people avoid is these being near the
place. In verse 241 below also, the mention of an act (other than
*seeing*) in the passage ‘the pig spoils the food by *smelling*’ is a
purely deprecatory supplement. Certainly, there can be no *smelling* by
one who does not *see*.

In fact, the verse merely describes the things that may happen to be
near by; what is meant is the Injunction that, since, as a rule, the pig
is prone to sniff at the food, and the cock is prone to flapping its
wings, and so forth,—therefore, one should feed the Brāhmaṇas in a
sheltered place; and the purpose served by the present verse is that it
implies that, where there is no danger of such untoward happenings, the
feeding may be done in an unsheltered place also.

‘*Eunuch*’—One without the signs of masculinity.—(239)

*Gautama* (15, 24).—‘What is seen by the dog, the Caṇḍāla and the
outcast becomes defiled.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.17, 20).—‘They forbid the seeing of the
Śrāddha by dogs and unqualified persons.’

*Viṣṇu* (82.6-9).—‘One should not look at a woman in her courses, nor a
dog, nor the village-hog, nor the village-cock.’

*Viṣṇu* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 516).—‘No persons of
deficient limbs, nor those with superfluous limbs, nor Śūdras, nor
outcasts, nor persons suffering from serious diseases, shall look at the
Śrāddha.’

*Uśanas* (Do.).—‘The village hog, the cat, the cock, the mungoose, the
woman in her courses, the Śūdra woman or her husband should be removed
to a distance.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘The cock, village-hog, crow, oat, the husband of a girl
married after puberty, impotent man, woman in her courses,—all these
should be always kept away at the time of the Śrāddha;—the cock defiles
by the flapping of its wings, the hog by smelling and the crow by
crowing; the dog by looking at it and the cat by hearing it, the husband
of the girl married after puberty defiles it by receiving gifts, and the
Śūdra by his eyes; the impotent man defiles by Ms shadow and the woman
in her courses by her touch.’

*Bṛhad- Yama* (38).—‘All these should be carefully kept away; otherwise
the Pitṛs go away disappointed and the man remains indebted.’

*Devala* (Aparāka, p. 472).—‘All that is disgusting or unclean, naked
man, a rogue, a woman in her courses, a man dressed in blue or ruddy
clothes, one with ears lopped off, weapons, iron, lead, man clothed in
dirty clothes, food kept overnight,—these shall be avoided at Śrāddhas.
If wine happen even to touch the house, the Śrāddha goes to the
Rākṣasas.’

*Vyāsa* (Do.).—‘The Caṇḍāla, the man clothed in ruddy clothes, the
leper, the outcast, the embryo-killer, one of doubtful birth, relatives
of outcasts,—all these should be avoided when one is performing a
Śrāddha.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘The naked man and others should not see the
Śrāddha, those who renounce the Veda are called *naked*; the thief, the
cruel man should not he seen, all other wicked men should he avoided.’

The cock defiles by the wind raised by its wings.

The meaning of this verse has already been explained above (under 239);
the sense is that the proximity of these should be avoided up to such
distance that they may not be able to see the performance.

‘*The man born of the low caste*’—here meant is the *Cāṇḍāla*; as it is
this that has been spoken of above.

It has been already explained above that the actions of *touching* and
the rest stand here for the action that has been mentioned above (in
239), and not for these actions themselves. For this reason, there is no
room for the following criticism.—“The touch of the *Cāṇḍāla* being
already prohibited generally, there could be no possibility of such
touching, and hence the prohibition here contained becomes superfluous;
hence the ‘man born of the low caste’ must be taken as the *Śūdra*; and
what is prohibited is the Śūdra touching the *Śrāddha*, etc., offered by
twice-born men, but not those performed by himself.”

Even if the actions of *touching*, etc., stand for themselves,—what is
meant is not that evil results from the Cāṇḍāla touching the articles of
food and drink, but that he should not touch the unsheltered spot on the
river-bank and such other places that has been selected for the
performance; as the impurity caused by such contact has been described
as removed by wind and fire. And thus, inasmuch as the touch of such
persons would be quite possible (under the circumstances just
described), it is only right that it should be prohibited.—(241)

In connection with infants who have not completed their third year, it
is going to be said that ‘cremation shall not be performed for him;’ it
is these that are spoken of here as ‘*those who have died without
sacraments*.’

‘*The remnant*’—contained in the dishes; as also ‘*what is scattered on
the Kuśa*’ forms their ‘*share*’ The term ‘*bhāgadheya*’ is the same as
‘*bhāga*.’

This does not mean that these persons are not helped by the *śrāddha*.

^(‘)*Those who* *hare* *abandoned*’—their elders. Or, ‘those who have
abandoned the ladies of their family, without finding any fault in
them.’ According to the former explanation, the term ‘*Kulayoṣitām*’ is
to be construed by itself, and taken to mean ‘unmarried maidens.’

For the reason stated, the remnant should be offered to the persons
mentioned.

It would not be right to raise the question—“Since the remnant would be
unclean, how could it be offered as the said share?”—because, in view of
this very text, there is no uncleanliness attaching to the remnant; just
as there is none in the case of the remnant of Soma-juice (at the
Soma-sacrifices).—(245)

This verse is quoted in *Varṣakriyākaumudī*, (p. 359), as enumerating
those entitled to the scattered food;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
562), which explains ‘*kulayoṣitām tyāginām*’ as ‘those who abandon the
ladies of their family without cause’, and adds that the food scattered
in the dish is for those who have died without sacraments, while that on
the ground is for the slaves;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 275);—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1512), which adds the following
notes:—‘*asaṃskṛta*’ stands for those whose Upanayana has not been done,
and also the unmarried girls,—‘*tyāginaḥ*’ are
suicides,—‘*kulayoṣitām*’, those ladies to whom water-offerings have not
been made;—or ‘*kulayoṣitām tyāginām*’ may be taken together, meaning
‘those who have abandoned their wives and ladies without cause.’

‘*Tyāginām kulayoṣitām*’—‘For those who abandon their elders *and* for
unmarried maidens; or to those who have abandoned the ladies of their
family, without fault’ (Medhātithi);—‘For women who have forsaken their
families’ (Govindarāja);—‘suicides and childless women’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘For
ascetics and...’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 376) without
any comment;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 504), which explains ‘*bhāgadheyam*’
as ‘share’; and adds that what is meant is that ‘for those persons of
his family who have died without Upanayana, and for those who have
forsaken the ladies of his family or such others as should not be
forsaken,—one should assign the food left in the dish in which the
Brāhmaṇas have eaten, as also that which has been scattered on the

The preceding verse has described the disposal of the remnant in the

the ground is for servants.

‘*Ajihma*’ means ‘*not dishonest*,’ ‘straightforward.’

‘*Aśaṭha*’ is ‘not idle,’ ‘dutiful.’

Of such servants the said remnant is the share.

For this reason, large quantities of food shall be served, so that, when

‘*For the twice-born person, just dead*’— one should perform the rite up
to ‘Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa;’ *i.e*., the offering of balls conjointly with the
two preceding ancestors, which constitutes the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa, the
‘Amalgamating Rite,’ shall not be made once—what, then, shall be
offered?—‘*He should offer one ball*;’ the particle ‘*ca*’ having the
sense of ‘*only*;’ the sense is that ‘one ball shall be offered, only to
the person just dead.’ The Brāhmaṇa also shall be fed in honour of that
person only.

In another *Smṛti*, there is declared another specific procedure—‘It
shall be without invitation and doing in fire’ (*Yājñavalkya*, *ācāra*
251); where ‘doing in fire’ stands for the seeking of permission with
the words, ‘I shall do this in fire;’ and the pouring of libations into
fire is not prohibited. In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, libations into fire have
been laid down in connection with the *Śrāddha* offered to the recent
dead.

At what time and how long is the rite to be performed—information on
these points should be sought for from another *Smṛti*; where it is said
that—(A) ‘The first *Śrāddha* is on the eleventh day,’—(B) ‘on the date
of death, for one year, the Śrāddha should be done every month, and
every year it shall be performed, like the monthly performance,’—and in
the *Kathaka* it is said, ‘This should be done every year.’

\(A\) The term ‘eleventh’ is only indicative of the day on which the
period of impurity ceases; since it has been declared that ‘having
become pure, one should make offerings to the Pitṛs.’

\(B\) The author of *Gṛhyasūtras* declares that the ‘Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa’
shall be performed at the end of the year.

The *Śrāddha* mentioned in the text is called ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’ (‘offered to
one person’); and the ‘offering’ (of the ball) is part of it.

It has been held that, on account of the declaration of the *Śruti*‘ one
should make offerings to the Pitṛs’ (quoted above),—the offering should
be made to the Father, Grand-father and Great-grandfather. But it cannot
be right to make this offering (to all three) until the
‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*’ has been performed. Because the *Smṛti* (regarding the
*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*) cannot be entirely set aside by the said Vedic
declaration.—(247)

This verse, as quoted by Medhātithi on p. 290, l. 1, reads
‘*Asapiṇḍa*’.—But the same sense may be got out of the reading
‘*Āsapiṇḍa*’.—See *Translation*.

“The *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*, the solemn reception of a dead person among the
partakers of oblations, is performed either on the thirteenth day, or a
year after death,”—says Buhler. But the rite is performed on the
*twelfth*, not the *thirteenth* day.

Hopkins has misunderstood the signification of the *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa* rite.
He calls it ‘ceremony on making a Sapiṇḍa (relative) for him’ and adds
that ‘it implies that the deceased died without any family to offer the
Śrāddha for him.’

As a matter of fact, this rite is performed for every one; and its
meaning is as explained by Buhler (see above).

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 802) in
support of the view that the ‘Śrāddha’ and ‘offering of the Ball’ are
two distinct acts.

After the *Sapṇḍīkaraṇa* or the Amalgamating Rite has been performed,
offering should be made to all the three ancestors, by ‘*that same
method*;’ *i.e*., in accordance with the procedure of the
“*Pārvaṇa-śrāddha*,” The term ‘*āvṛt*’ means *procedure*, *method*;
which is thus prescribed—‘The *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa Śrāddha* should be
performed, as preceded by the rite in honour of the gods;—the Pitṛs
should be fed,—and among them the person just dead.’ By the term ‘Pitṛs’
here are meant the three ancestors beginning with the Grandfather, who
have already entered the category of the ‘Pitṛs,’ by having been
‘united;’ these should be fed;—and ‘among them’—*i.e*., among those same
Brāhmaṇas that are fed for the united Pitṛs, the ‘person just dead’
should be invited; as it is thus that he becomes united with the
ancestors; and this rite is meant to bring about this union Though Viṣṇu
reads—‘One should feed Brāhmaṇas in honour of the dead person, also in
that of the father, grandfather, and greatgrandfather of the dead
person,’—yet here also it is not stated that they shall be fed
separately. So that, just as a sacrificial material intended for several
deities is offered to them all in a single oblation, similarly, the
Brāhmaṇa also may be fed in honour of several ancestors; and there would
be no incongruity in this. In fact, it is only thus that the use of the
term ‘*saha*’ (in our text) becomes justified; and thus also it is that
one avoids the feeding of an even number of Brāhmaṇas at the rite in
honour of the Pitṛs \[as there would be, if the Brāhmaṇa fed in honour
of the dead person were distinct from the three fed in honour of the
three higher *united* ancestors.\] Further, according to those persons
who accept the second alternative mentioned in verse 125, and feed one
Brāhmaṇa each at the rite, in honour of the gods and that in honour of
the Pitṛs, only one man is fed in honour of the three ancestors;
similarly, here also (the same Brāhmaṇa shall be fed for four).

“The same line of argument would apply also to the rule that ‘three
persons should be fed at the rite, in honour of the Pitṛs;’ and there
also each of these three men might he fed in honour of all the. Pitṛs;
as there also there is no mention of their being distinct.”

How do you say that there is no such mention? We read in the
*Gṛhyasūtra*—‘One ball alone shall not be offered to all,—this has been
made clear by the term *balls* itself.’ Then again, it is said that ‘the
cup dedicated to the deceased shall be poured into the cups dedicated to
the Pitṛs;’ and if the cup of the deceased person were not distinct,
from which cup could the water-offering be poured? If it be said that it
would be poured out of the cup dedicated to all in common,—this would be
highly improper; for that cup will have been dedicated to the three
ancestors beginning with the grandfather, and not to the father (just
dead); and it would not be proper to offer the water to the latter out
of that which has been dedicated to others. It might be argued that the
*mixing up* (laid down in the text just quoted) might be done after the
water-offering has been made. But in that case, the said mixing would be
done for the purposes of an entirely different offering; and this would
be contrary to the injunction regarding the ‘pouring out,’ On the other
hand, there is no incongruity in the method described by us above.

The next question that arises is—Who is it that is called ‘*Preta*,’
‘departed,’ ‘deceased’ (mentioned by Viṣṇu above as one in whose honour
Brāhmaṇas should be fed)? \[The word meaning ‘dead’ should apply to all
ancestors.\]. As a matter of fact, however, no ball is offered to the
great-grandfather after the Amalgamating Bite has been performed, since
he has become united with the previous ancestors. Says the *Smṛti*,—

‘One who offers a separate hall to the *united* deceased, becomes by
that act, the murderer of injunctions, as also of his father.’ And yet
the ball is offered to the ‘deceased’ separately; and one and the same
ball is not offered in common to all. In fact, the mantras that are
recited at the rite also express the same idea —‘*ye samānāḥ*, *&c*.’

Our answer to the above is as follows¹The term ‘*preta*,’ ‘departed,’
does not denote the act connoted by the root ‘*iṇ*,’ ‘to go;’ in fact,
it is used, not in its etymological, but conventional, sense of ‘one
*recently* dead;’ certainly, one who has gone out on a long journey is
not called a ‘*preta*’ (as he should he, if the term were used in its
etymological sense). Further, the action of ‘going’ is present in the
person who died long ago, as well as in one only just dead. It is for
this reason that we have such expressions in the *Śruti* as—(*a*)
‘*Prayannevāsmallokād-yesamānāḥ*, etc.,’ and (*b*)
‘*pretāyāmandinatrayam*’—where the term ‘*preta*’ is applied to one
recently dead. As for the text quoted above—‘he who would offer a
separate ball to the deceased, etc.,’—the meaning of it is as follows:
After the ‘Amalgamating Rite,’ the ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’ the ‘Unitary Rite,’
should not be performed,—whenever *śrāddha* is performed, it should he
offered to all the three ancestors,—and on the date of death also, it
should be offered to the three ancestors, and not to the Father only. It
is thus that the method of the ‘*Pārvaṇa-śrāddha*’ has been mentioned in
the present text,—by the words, ‘by this same method’—as to be adopted,
in the *Śrāddha* in question also.

“The pronoun ‘this’ appears to stand for what forms the subject-matter
of the present context; as pronouns, by their very nature, denote what
is nearest to them; and in the present instance, what is nearest is the
injunction regarding the ‘Unitary Rite.’”

Not so. If, even after the performance of the ‘Amalgamating Rite,’ the
offering were made to one person only, then there would be no point in
mentioning the two cases separately (as is done in 247 and 248).
Further, the particle ‘*tu*,’ ‘but,’ clearly indicates deviation from
the method of what forms the subject-matter of the context; the sense
being—‘the rule that has been laid down pertains to the case where the
Amalgamating Rite has not been performed; but this should not be applied
to the case where the said Rite has been performed.’ From all this it
follows that, even though the mention of the method of the ‘*Pārvaṇa*’
is more remote, yet it is that which is meant to be adopted, in the
present connection. Further, if after the performance of the
‘Amalgamating Rite,’ whenever it would be necessary to perforin the
‘Unitary Rite,’ the offering to all three ancestors would be made on the
Amāvasyā day,—then what would be the difference? For, in this case also,
would not there be present the condition mentioned in the present
text—‘after the Amalgamating Rite has been performed, etc., etc.’ Nor in
the Institutes of Manu do we find any other time prescribed, such as
‘every year on the date of death etc.,’ to which the present text could
be held to apply. So that (by the reasoning of the opponent), in all
cases, it would be the ‘Unitary Rite’ that would have to be performed.
And this would be contrary to the declaration of the Mahābhārata, where,
in reference to the places of pilgrimage, it is said—

‘He satisfied his forefathers by means of *śrāddha*.’

As regards the text of the other *Smṛti*—‘livery year, the śrāddha shall
be performed like the monthly performance,’—here also the ‘*monthly
śrāddha*’ refers to the *śrāddha* on the *Amāvasyā*; as this latter is
the archetype of all *śrāddhas*; and it is in connection with this that
all the details have been prescribed. And it will not be right to take
the term, ‘monthly performance,’ as standing for the *Śrāddha* performed
every month during the year; because no specific details have been
prescribed in connection with this latter, whereby it could be
differentiated. As for the ‘Unitary Rite,’ the first of its kind is
performed on the eleventh day (after death, (or the *Brāhmaṇa*), and on
the thirteenth day (for the *Kṣatriya*), and so forth. Hence it cannot
be right to refer to the ‘Unitary Rite’ by the term ‘monthly
performance;’ the monthly performance is so called because of its
connection with the ‘month’ as the time; but there is no connection
between the Unitary Rite and any such time as the ‘month;’ it having
been shown that it is connected with other points of time also. For
instance, it having been declared that—‘becoming pure, one should make
offerings to the Pitṛs,’ it follows that such offerings could be made
before the end of the month, as well as after it; so that there is no
reason for speaking of it by the name ‘monthly performance.’ As for the
‘*Amāvasyā Śrāddha*,’ on the other hand, its originative injunction
containing the term ‘*Pūrṇamāsa*’ (the Full Moon Day, which literally
means *Full-Month*),—the time being fixed by such texts as ‘the offering
should be made *monthly*’—and no other time being mentioned in this
connection,—and all the details of the *Amāvasyā Śrāddha* being found
present in the *Śrāddha* in question also,—it is only right that this
latter should be declared as having the details of the ‘*Amāvasyā*’
applicable to it.

The Śrāddha-offering with uncooked substances also has its archetype in
the ‘*Pārvaṇa-Śrāddha*;’ and having this for its archetype, it would
follow that the offering is to be made to three ancestors; and hence (in
view of the possibility of this being accepted), the text enjoins the
propriety of the ‘Unitary Offering’ only.

As for Yājñavalkya’s declaration (*Ācāra*, 256)—‘For one year, every
month, on the date of death, the Śrāddha should be performed; similarly,
at the end of each year; the first Śrāddha being performed on the
eleventh day (after death);’—here also it is the same method that is
prescribed. There also it is the ‘*Amāvasyā Śrāddha*,’ that has been
recognised as the archetype. Even if the ‘Unitary

Rite’ were connected with the ‘month’ as the time, it would not be right
to make it borrow its details from the Rite here mentioned; as a beggar
does not beg from another beggar; so that, since this also would be as
much of an ‘Ectypal Rite’ as the ‘Unitary Rite’ itself (there could be
no borrowing between them).

Further, there is only one *Śrāddha*; and the term ‘monthly’ being a
generic one, there is nothing to indicate that it stands for the
‘Unitary Rite’ only.

In Yājñavalkya also we find the same thing. If Yājñavalkya’s text were
taken as referring to what has gone immediately before it, then the
method of the ‘Amalgamating Rite’ should be applicable to it; as the
*Śrāddha* in question is found mentioned after this latter. Having
said—‘this is the Amalgamating Rite,’ and ‘before the Amalgamating
Rite,’—it is said immediately after this ‘on the date of death, &c.’

From all this it follows that not taking any account of mere proximity,
the details that are indicated as belonging to it are those of the
‘*Amāvasyā Śrāddha*.’

The Mantras also support our view. It says—‘Become united with the
previous ancestors, &c., &c.’ and it is the person recently dead who is
thus addressed; the plural number in ‘*Saṃsṛjyadhvam*; being purely
honorific: as says the author of the *Nirukta*—‘In the expression *etā
utyā uṣasaḥ* &c., the single *Uṣas*, Dawn, is spoken of in the plural,
for the purpose of showing respect to it.”

“The term ‘*Saṃsṛjyadhvam*,’ ‘become united,’ should refer to those
balls into which the ball offered to the deceased is thrown in; and this
latter ball also should be referred to by words in the plural,
‘*pūrvebhiḥ pitṛbhiḥ* etc.’ For in this case it is only this latter
plural number that will have to be regarded as figurative. Otherwise, if
the plural verb ‘*Saṃsṛjyadhvam*’ also were taken as referring to the
ball that is thrown in, the plural number in both would have to be
regarded as figurative and unreal.”

There is no force in this also. Because as a matter of fact, what
becomes united with each one of the balls is only a portion of the ball
that is thrown in; as is clear from the direction—‘having offered the
fourth ball, one should divide it into three parts and put it into the
balls so that the three balls do not all become the *container*, at one
and the same time; and it is only if this were the case that the plural
number in ‘*Saṃsṛjyadhvam*’ could be applicable literally.

“If each of the three is referred to separately, even so, why could not
the plural in ‘*Saṃsṛjyadhvam*’ and the indirect address be taken as
referring to the balls into which the one ball is thrown in? Specially
as the word ‘*pitrvebhiḥ*’ referring to the ball that is thrown in, it
would not be right to refer to it by the pronoun ‘*ebhiḥ*,’ ‘these.”’

Well, the Mantra in question—‘*Saṃsṛjyaḍhvam* etc.’ not being an
injunctive one, we need not trouble ourselves over its interpretation;
it is, as a matter of fact, purely descriptive; and the description
applies to what is enjoined; and in the present connection what has been
enjoined is the *uniting* of the balls; so that this *uniting* is all
that is indicated by the *Mantra*. As for the *number* (singular or
plural), this is not directly enjoined (by any text), and hence also not
obtained by implication; it becomes connected with the passage by mere
probability, and this *probability* is recognised prior to the *Mantra*
(which therefore could have no bearing upon it).

Some people have said that—“the term ‘fourth’ (in the text just quoted)
may mean simply *predecessor*; so that the deceased (father) being the
first, in relation to him the great-grandfather would be the ‘fourth’
predecessor.”

This also is not right. In fact, it is the ball offered to the deceased
which is called the *fourth*,—this being the one which completes the
number *four*, after the balls to his ancestors have been deposited.
Further, the *Śrāddha* in question begins with the *Pitṛs*, and not with
the deceased; since it has been declared that—‘one shall invite the
Pitṛs, not mentioning the deceased.’ So that the order to be adopted
would be that the first ball offered is to the father (of the deceased);
and in regard to this also the following rule has been laid down; *The
dividing into three parts* and the placing upon the balls to the Pitṛs
are to be done of that same ball which is the fourth. All that is meant
there is that ‘one should giveaway the fourth ball after having divided
it into three parts;’ the connection of the ‘ball’ with the act of
‘giving away’ being clearly implied. When the question arises as to what
is that which is to be divided into three parts,—it is *the ball* that
is mentioned in close proximity which becomes connected with it. All
doubts being set at rest by this, there is apparently no ground for
connecting the term ‘fourth’ also with it.

Then again, when there is a doubt as to which ball is it that is to be
divided, the answer is supplied by another Smṛti—‘Having offered four
balls to each individual name, the offerer of the ball should divide the
*first* with the two mantras beginning with *ye samānāḥ*.’ The one
particular ball is called ‘*first*’ only in view of its being the first
to be offered, and not because of its being related to the first
ancestor. Because the great-grandfather would be the ‘predecessor’ of
the grandfather, who, in his turn, would be the ‘predecessor’ of the
Father; so that there being no definiteness, the exact meaning of the
verse would remain uncertain. The order of the *offering*, however, is
fixed by rule; hence in that there is no indefiniteness.

Thus then, the act of *dividing into three parts* having been connected
with the fourth ball, this dividing should be done, on the strength of
another *Smṛti*, in the order of the *offering*. Consequently, it is
said in the *Kāṭhaka* that—‘it is clear that the dividing is of the
previously dead,’;—we ask now—whence does it follow that this is clear?

It has been held that—“the offering is not made to the deceased because
he has become included among the Pitṛs.”

This also is nothing. Because it is in accordance with a direct
injunction that the offering is not made: ‘The ball does not go to the
fourth;’ again ‘the ball proceeds to three only.’ As for the reading
invented by the writer himself—‘he shall not mention the deceased,’ and
the explanation of this as that ‘the deceased having become united with
the Pitṛs, this text prohibits a further offering to him,’—the fact of
the matter is that the reading of the text is not thus; in reality no
prohibitive term is found in the text at all; what is found is the
cumulative particle (‘*ca*’ instead of ‘*na*’). Even if the reading
contained the negative particle, the same explanation would apply to
this case which we have pointed out in connection with the prohibition
of a separate ball for the deceased contained in the verse—‘*yaḥ
sapiṇḍīkṛtam* etc. etc’.

As regards such assertions as—‘after the Amalgamating Rite the son shall
perform for his parents, every year, the Unitary Rite, and for the rest
the *Pārvaṇa* rite’,—and so forth, if there are really such passages (in
authoritative works) then what is the use of the proclaiming of the name
‘*Amāvasyā*?’ In fact, these passages are not found in any of the
well-known Smṛti texts recognised by cultured people.

For these reasons, we conclude that there is nothing to indicate any
differentiation, from which we could deduce the fact that the balls
offered to the ancestors are placed upon that offered to the deceased.
For this same reason the established practice should not be abandoned.
It has also been shown that this same view is in accordance with reason;
Thus it is clear that some people have been led to accept the view that
the balls of the ancestors are to be deposited, by construing the words
of the text in a different manner.

In verse 247 here—where it is said that ‘For the twice-born person just
dead, there should be performed the rite upto Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa, one should
do the feeding at his *Śrāddha* without any in honour of the gods, and
he shall offer one ball;’—The ‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*’ or ‘Amalgamating Rite’
should be regarded only as partially binding in a case where the Father
has died, while the Grandfather is still alive; *i.e*., it is to be
performed only when no regard is paid to the prohibition contained in
the words ‘one shall not make an offering that involves the ignoring of
a living person.’ When, however, one accepts the view that ‘there should
be precedence etc. etc.’ then, the Grandfather should be left out and
the dead father should be united to the higher ancestors. Similarly, the
rite is only partially binding when the Father is offering the *Śrāddha*
to his dead son. Similarly, too, when one’s wife dies without issue, the
performance is only partially binding upon the step-son whose mother may
be living.

Says the text—‘For those that die childless, others shall perform the
rite, and those ladies again for those.’

The term ‘*sutaiḥ*,’ ‘sons’ in the text stands for *children*; though
the presence of the term ‘*suta*’ might be taken to indicate the
inclusion of the son’s substitutes also, if the particle ‘*sva*,’ ‘own,’
were not taken as precluding those others.—(248)

Burnell is wrong in saying that ‘verse 248 is apparently omitted by
Medhātithi’ It is strange that scholars of the ‘Critical School’ should
be making such statements on the strength of Mss. which they know to be
imperfect and incomplete.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 802) as likely to be
interpreted as indicating the ‘offering of the Ball’ to be the principal
factor. It combats this view and adds that in the compound
‘*piṇḍanirvapaṇam*’ the term ‘*piṇḍa*’ is to be understood as synonymous
with ‘*pitṛ*’, so that what the compound means is ‘offering to the
Pitṛs.’

*Medhātithi* (P. 286, l. 14)—‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇaśrāddham* *&c*.’ This
appears to be a paraphrase of the verse, which is quoted also in
*Mitākṣarā* (on ll. 253-254), where, however, the reading is ‘*pretānna
nirdishet*.’ See below Bhāṣya, p. 289, ll. 15-20.

Though the text mentions the evil accruing to the diner, yet the advice
intended is conveyed to the performer of the *śrāddha*; the sense being
that ‘he should manage it so that the diner does not offer the leavings
to a *Śūdra*.’ This form of the rule is analogous to that pertaining to
the Priests (where also what is meant is that the master of the
sacrifice so arranges things that the Priests do not commit any breaches
of law).

They say that the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ in this verse stands for *woman*
generally; and in this sense they explain the etymology of the term to
mean—‘*vṛṣasyati’—chālayati*, ‘moves’—‘*bhartāram*.’ ‘her husband,’ Be
this woman a *Brāhmaṇī* or any other caste—all are prohibited. Says
another *Smṛti* (Gautama, 15.23)—‘On that day he shall remain firmly
continent.’

‘*Bed*’ denotes *sexual intercourse*; the prohibition does not apply to
merely *entering the bed*.

‘*Day*’ stands for day and night; hence the prohibition applies to the
night also.

‘*Ordure*’—this is a deprecatory exaggeration, intended to dissuade men.

‘*His ancestors*’—*i.e*., the ancestors of the man eating at the
*śrāddha*.

This also has to be explained as before; that is, the rule applies to
both (the feeder and the eater). As regards the eater, what is here laid
down is only ‘circumstantial;’ that is, it is enjoined as to be observed
by him only when the circumstance of eating at *śrāddhas* is present.
From the context, however, it is clear that it pertains to the Rite (and
hence to the Performer) also.—(250)

‘*Vṛṣalī*’—Neither Medhātithi nor Kullūka takes this in the sense of a
‘Śūdra female.’ Buhler is not right in attributing this explanation to
them. Both of them explain it as ‘any woman’; and they derive this
meaning etymologically, by using the term ‘*vṛṣasyati*,’ ‘one who
attracts to herself the male.’ Nor is Buhler right in attributing to
Nārāyaṇa the explanation that the word ‘*vṛṣalī*’ means ‘a seducing
woman’; as Nārāyaṇa also uses the term ‘*vṛṣasyanti*’ only by way of
pointing out the etymological signification of the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’.

After food, drink and water for sipping have been offered, the guests
should be questioned—with the words ‘have you eaten well?’

According to another *Smṛti*, the question should be put by the host,
food in hand. It is the nature of some people that if the food is not
near at hand, they do not ask for it, even though they may have desire
for it, fearing the trouble they would cause; but if the food is close
by, they take it.

‘*After they have been fully satisfied, he shall make them wash*.’

Others have explained this to mean that the guests should be put the
question—‘Are you fully satisfied?’ And when they have ascertained the
fact of their having been fully satisfied, they should be further
propitiated by the question—‘Have you dined well?’ It is going to be
declared (under 254) that ‘at the rite in honour of the Pitṛs one should
say *Have you dined well?*’

‘*When they ham washed, he shall say &c*.’—‘*Where you choose*’—*i.e*.,
at either of the two places,—here or at your own house, you may take
your rest, in any manner you choose.—(251)

*Viṣṇu* (73. 25-26).—‘After the Brāhmaṇas have eaten and become fully
satisfied, he shall sprinkle water with grass on the food, with mantra
‘*Māmekṣeṣṭha*,’—scatter the food near the leavings,—ask the Brāhmaṇas,
*Are you fully satisfied*—and having made them sit facing the north, he
shall offer them water for rinsing the mouth; after that he shall

Other persons also, happening to be present on the occasion, should
offer words of encouragement; and the terms to be used are here
mentioned.

Another commentator explains as follows:—The permission to take food
should be sought by means of these terms; hence these words have got to
be uttered by the performer of the *Śrāddha*. But he should say,
‘*Svadadhvam*,’ ‘please eat well,’ and not ‘*Svaditam*,’ ‘well eaten;’
or, the reading may be ‘*Svadatu*’ (‘do eat please’).

This explanation is based upon another *Smṛti* and upon custom; and,
according to this, when the Brāhmaṇas have begun to eat, they should be
enlivened by the performer of the *Śrāddha* with these words.

‘*At the goṣṭha*’—*i.e*., when several cows are sitting at the same
place;—the word to be pronounced is ‘*Suśṛtam*,’ ‘well-cooked.’

The word ‘*Astu*,’ ‘may it be,’ is understood everywhere.

At the rite in honour of the gods, the term used should be ‘*rucitam*’
or ‘*rocitam*—(254)

The *Śrāddha* should be performed in the afternoon.

‘*These are the essentials* *of* *Śrāddha rites*,’—*i.e*., attempt
should be made to bring about all these things.

Though the present text mentions the ‘afternoon’ without reference to
any particular *Śrāddha*, yet it is not to be observed in connection
with *all* Śrāddhas: for we have another Smṛti-text to the effect
that—‘rites in honour of the gods shall he performed in the forenoon;
that in honour of the Pitṛs in the afternoon; the Śrāddha offered to a
single person shall be performed at mid-day, while that in connection
with auspicious rites shall be performed in the morning.’

‘*Dwelling*’—house; the ‘*setting* *up*’ ‘of this consists in the
white-washing of the walls with lime etc., the smearing of the floor
with cowdung; having its slope to wards the south.

‘*Liberality*’—charity; *i.e*., unstinted giving away of food and
vegetables.

‘*Cleaning*’—washing; *i.e*., a particular maimer of preparing the food.

Others have explained this verse to mean that these things constitute
the ‘excellence’—the superiority—of the rites,—and not that they shall
not be performed without these.—(255)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 474), which explains ‘*Sṛṣṭi*’ as
connoting ‘plenty’, and ‘*Mṛṣṭi*’ as connoting ‘deliciousness’;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 111 and 72), which adds the following
notes:—‘*V* *āstu*’, the house built for the Śrāddha-performance,—its
‘*Sampādana*’ means ‘building or acquiring by purchase, making it slope
towards the South, levelling, washing and besmearing with
cow-dung’—‘*Sṛṣṭi*’ means ‘giving away’ *i.e*., freely giving away
vegetables and other things,—‘*Mṛṣṭi*’, cleanliness or
sweetness,—‘*agryāḥ*’, those equipped with *Vedic* learning,—these are
‘*Śrāddhasampadaḥ*’ *i.e*., excellences of things used at the Śrāddha;
this implies that all these should be got together.

*Prajāpati* (70.71).—‘The following Brāhmaṇas are conducive to the
accomplishment of the Śrāddha:—Those that are devoted to the Vedic
duties, those that are of calm disposition, sinless, devoted to the
fires, firm in their duties, firm in their austerities, conversant with
the meaning of the Veda, born of noble families, devoted to their
parents, living by the methods prescribed for Brāhmaṇas, teachers, those
conversant with Brahman.’

‘*Kuśa-grass*’—is well-known.

‘*Sanctificatory texts*’—Mantras.

‘*Sacrificial food*’— articles of food fit for sacrifices; these are

‘*Purity*’—cleanliness of conduct.

term ‘*havya*,’ ‘sacrifice,’ standing for what is done in honour of the
gods.—(256)

‘*Hermit*’—*i.e*., the Vānaprastha; his ‘*food*’ consists of the
*Nīvāra* and other wild-growing grains; this is mentioned only by way of
illustration; it indicates the *Vrīhi* and other similar grains; and it
is in view of this that in the preceding verse we have the phrase ‘of
all kinds,’ and also in the verse 266, the expression, ‘sacrificial food
which serves for a long time,’ which introduces the enumeration of
artificially grown grains also, such as ‘*tila, vrīhi*, *yava, māṣa*,’
and so forth.

‘*Milk*’—which includes its preparations, such as curds and the like;
such being the sense of *Smṛtis* and also sanctioned by usage.

‘*Unforbidden*’—sanctioned, not prohibited. Meat obtained from
slaughter-houses is regarded as ‘forbidden.’

‘*Akṣāralavaṇa*’—A doubt arises here as to whether this is a negative
compound containing a copulative one, or a purely negative compound.
Does it mean merely ‘absence of salts and alkalines’ (as it would, if it
were a negative compound with a copulative one), or is ‘*kṣāra-kavaṇa*’
(alkaline salt) the name of a particular kind of salt, and the text
permits the use of salts other than that kind *?* It appears better to
take it as standing for a particular kind of salt. If it meant the mere
negation of a copulative compound, there would be two compounds, and the
negative particle would have to be construed with each of the two
members of the copulative compound; and all this would involve a great
deal of complication.

‘*Sacrificial food, by nature*;’—that is, all this is to be regarded as
‘sacrificial food,’ without any qualifications; this is what is to be
understood to be the meaning in all such general injunctions as ‘he
lives upon *sacrificial food*,’ breakfasts on *sacrificial food*,’ and
so forth—(257).

(Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘not dressed as usual’ (Nandana);—‘not
tainted by bad smell’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 225), which explains
‘*anupaskṛtam*’ as ‘of such seasonings as are brought about by cooking
&c.’ It rejects the explanation of Kullūka (‘free from bad smell’) on
the ground that the word can have no such meaning;—and in *Aparārka* (p.
500), which explains it as ‘what has not been cooked for some other
purpose’—and again on p. 551, as enumerating what is *haviṣya*;—also in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 541 and 573);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
4220), which explains ‘*anupaskṛtam*’ as ‘not rotten’, ‘not foul
smelling’,—*Soma* as the juice of the Soma-creeper;—and in

thread of the context.

‘*Dismissed*’—having permitted them to go wherever they please.

‘*Those Brāhmaṇas*’—who have dined.

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 183), which
adds the following notes:—Vācaspati Miśra has explained this to mean
that ‘though actually facing the East, the man should, *in thought* face
the South’; but this is not right; as Gobhila has distinctly laid down
that the man should be actually facing the South.—Nor is there any
reason for taking the words of Manu in that sense; it is for this reason
that the commentators have explained the phrase ‘*dakṣiṇām
diśamākāṅkṣan*’ as ‘looking towards the South’.

The verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 207), which has the
following notes:—‘facing the East but looking sideways towards the
South’; Kullūka has explained ‘*ākāṅkṣan*’ as *looking towards*; but
such is not the meaning of the word;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1483), which explains the meaning as—‘Dismissing them, to go their way,
rising and following them and bringing them to the place for washing the
feet, and then looking towards the South, should ask for the desired
boons.’

Some people make the offering *after* the Brāhmaṇas have been fed.

‘*They cause them to be eaten by birds*.’—This mode of disposal is in
addition to those mentioned above.

‘*Fire*—this is only a reiteration of what has been said above.

This offering of balls, after the feeding of Brāhmaṇas, is meant to be
done near the place where the leavings of the dinner lie.—(261)

‘*Parastāt*’—This is the right reading, and not ‘*purastāt*’; as it is
clear that the offering is to be made *after* the feeding of the
Brāhmaṇas.

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 599),
which, accepting the reading ‘*purastāt*’, explains the line to mean
that ‘the offering is made *before* the Brāhmaṇas begin to eat, just
after they have been worshipped, or after the offering has been made
into the fire.’—The whole verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla,
p. 563), which says that ‘*prakṣipanti etc*.’ is only reiterative of
what has been prescribed in the preceding verse.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 752) also quotes the first half, reading
‘*purastāt*’; and adds the following explanation:—Some people hold that
the offering of the Ball is to be done *before* the Brāhmaṇas have
eaten, just after they have been worshipped, or after the offerings have
been made into the fire;—but from the use of the term ‘*kechit*’ in the
text, it seems that according to others the Ball is to be offered after
the Brāhmaṇas have eaten, but before they have washed, or after they
have washed, but either before or after they have been dismissed. The
conclusion on this point is that the offering of the Ball is to be done
*before* the feeding of the Brāhmaṇas only at inferior *Śrāddhas* that
are performed before the Amalgamating Rite, while at this Rite itself as
well as at those that follow it, it is to be done *after* the feeding.
The difference in this practice is due to the custom obtaining among the
followers of the different Vedic Schools.

The modes of disposal mentioned above apply to the first and the last
balls; but the middlemost of the balls the lawful wife, desiring a son,
should eat; *i.e*., the wife who has not been married merely for the
sake of pleasure.

‘*Devoted to her husband*;’—one who makes it her vow that—‘I shall serve
my husband alone, even in my mind I shall never entertain even a thought
of faithlessness to him.’

‘*Intent upon*’—with full faith in—‘*the worshipping*’—the *śrāddha* and
other rites—‘*of the Pitṛs*.’ That is, she betakes herself with great
care to the performance of these.

‘*Should eat in the proper manner*—*i.e*., fully observing the rules
regarding the rinsing of the mouth and sipping of.water etc., etc.—(262)

follow the rules regarding sipping of water.

‘*Jñatiprāyam*’—is to be explained as ‘that which goes to (*praiti*) to
the paternal relations (*jñātiṣu*);’ this he should make; *i.e*., he
should offer food to them.

‘*Having treated than well*, *he should feed other relations*.’ Those
belonging to the same ‘*gotra*’ are called ‘*jñati*,’ ‘paternal
relations,’ while those related on the mother’s and the wife’s side are
called ‘*bāṇḍhava*,’ ‘releations.’

The following question is here raised:—

“It has been said above (in verse 253) that ‘he should do us they tell
him;’ now if they were to tell him, ‘Send all this food to our home,’
then, what would become of the *Vaiśvadeva* and other oblations?”

In that case, the man will have to cook food again. Or, the offering of
the remnant to the Brāhmaṇas may be regarded as being prescribed only
with a view to some transcendental result,—and not with a view to their
actually taking it all away. For instance, it has been laid down that —‘
When informed of food having been left, they should say *it is for your
friends*;’ and this direction would have to be regarded as only
optional, if, in certain cases, the Brāhmaṇas were to take away the
food.—(264)

There is nothing in Medhātithi to show that he reads ‘*pūjayet*’ for
‘*bhojayet*’, as stated by Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 512), which explains ‘*Jñāti*’ as
‘relations on the father’s side’, and ‘*bāndhava*’ as ‘relations on the
mother’s side’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1515), which has the
following notes:—‘*Jñāti*’ are relations on the father’s side, *i.e*.,
Sapiṇḍas;—the remnant of the food cooked for the *Śrāddha* should be
made to reach those; *i.e*., they should be fed with it with due
respect; after which one should honour the ‘*Bāndhavas*,’ *i.e*.,
relations on the mother’s and the wife’s side; if, however, on being
asked ‘what shall be done with the remnant?’—the Brāhmaṇas should say
‘give it to us’—then other food should be cooked for the relations; and
these are to be fed with the remnant, only if so permitted by the
Brāhmaṇas. It may be regarded as incumbent on the Brāhmaṇas to give this
permission.

Until the Brāhmaṇas have departed, the food that may be contained in the
dishes out of which they have eaten, or which may have fallen on the
ground, shall not be removed.

‘*After that, he should make the domestic offering*.’ The *Śrāddha* rite
having been finished, he should offer the oblation to the Viśvedevas and
attend to the daily routine of feeding the guests, &c. The term
‘*offering*’ is merely indicative.

Others offer the following explanation:—“The term ‘offering’ here stands
for the offering made to the elementals; and in this way the pouring of
libations into fire before the feeding of *Brāhmaṇas*, does not become
improper. It will not be right to argue that—‘when the rite in honour of
the Pitṛs has been begun, it cannot be right to thrust into it other
rites;’—for, according to the rule by which the *Śrāddha* extends over
two days, though the inviting of the Brāhmaṇas (which is part of the
*Śrāddha*) is done on the preceding day, yet there is nothing wrong in
the morning and evening libations being offered into fire; and the same
may be the case with the *Vaiśvadeva* libation, which also is poured
into the ‘Upasad’ fire. So that what are postponed (till after the
completion of the *Śrāddha*) are only those details that come
*after*—and not those that come *before*—the offering to the
elementals.”

Our reply to the above is as follows:—If the *Vaiśvadeva* oblation is
offered into the fire beforehand, then the *ball-offering* would come
after the *Śrāddha*; and in that case the ‘sacrifice to the gods’ and
the ‘offering to the elementals’ would become separated; and this would
militate against the prescribed order of sequence. Further, the time
being taken up by the *Śrāddha* offered to the Pitṛs, this does not
quite interfere with the time of the *Vaiśvadeva* oblation. From all
this it follows that all the ‘Great Sacrifices’ should be performed
after the *Śrāddha*.

and Karka the term ‘*bali*’ here stands for the Vaiśvadeva offering; but
for the Kākabali, according to Divodāsa;—in *Hemādri* (*Kāla*, p. 606),

As between direct and indirect connection, the former being more
authoritative, we construe ‘*gavyena’—‘cow’s*’—with ‘*payasā*,’ ‘milk
and not with ‘*māṃsa*,’ ‘meat,’ which forms the subject-matter of the
context.

Others, however, explain the particle ‘*ca*’ as having a cumulative
force, and then explain the passage to mean, ‘meat of the cow, and milk
or milk-rice.’

‘*Pāyasa*,’ ‘*milk-preparations*,’ stands for curds and such things, as
also rice cooked in milk.

‘*Vārdhrīṇasa*’—is *old goat*. The scriptures describe it as follows
s—‘Drinking with three, devoid of sense-virility and white,—such a goat
has been called *Vārdhriṇasa* by persons learned in sacrifices, in
connection with sacrificial rituals.’ That goat is called ‘drinking with
three’ who wets his tongue and two ears, while drinking water.

The Expiatory Rite that Śaṅkha has prescribed in connection with the
eating of beef, should be understood to apply to eating apart from the
‘*Madhuparka*’ offering and from the ‘*Aṣṭakā’ Śrāddhas*.—(271)

‘*Vārdhrīṇasa*’—‘An old goat, white and with long ears reaching the
water at the time of drinking’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘a black-necked, red-headed, white-winged crane’
(Nārāyaṇa).

Both these explanations are noted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 706),
where, however, the colour of the goat is mentioned as *red*, not
*white*. The definition of the goat quoted by Medhātithi is here
attributed to *Viṣṇudharmottara*, and that of the crane to the
‘*Nigama*’.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 295), which adds the
definition of *Vārdhrīṇasa* as *white*;—and the first half in *Aparārka*
(p. 551), which explains ‘*pāyasa*’ as ‘rice cooked in milk’, and adds
that this milk should be such as is not forbidden.

It is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 536), which supplies the
description of the *Vārdhrīṇasa* as given in the *Nigama*—‘(a) The old
goat whose ears and mouth touch the water, who has lost his virility;
(b) the bird which has black neck, red head and white wings’.

‘*Kālaśāka*’—is a well-known variety of vegetable; applying to the
darker variety of the ‘*Vāstūka*.’

‘*Mahāśalka*’ stands for the porcupine. Others have explained it as
standing for a special kind of fish.

‘*Khaḍga*’—Rhinoceros.

‘*Loha*’—the black goat, or one whiçh is *red* all over. Says the
*Purāṇa*—‘the red goat, and the black one, serve for endless time.’
Though the term ‘*loha*’ denotes the *colour*, it indirectly indicates
the goat having that colour. The term ‘*loha*’ is used in the sense of
‘black’ as well as ‘red’—being applied to iron, which is black, as also
to *copper* which is red. Though this variety of colour is found in
sheep and other animals also, yet, on the strength of other *Smṛtis*, it
has been explained here as standing for the *goat* only.

Others, however, have explained the term ‘*loha*’ as standing for the
bird, called ‘*lohapṛṣṭha*,’ the Heron; which is mentioned by means of a
part of the name only. Just as Devadatta is often spoken of as simply
‘Datta.’

It is necessary to find the support of usage in the case of both these
explanations.

‘*Honey*’—that collected by bees.

In the case of all the things mentioned in the present contest, all that
is meant is the *great satisfaction* produced by the offerings; and
stress is not meant to be laid upon the exact period of time mentioned
in each case. If this were really meant, then one might be justified in
omitting the performance of *Śrāddhas* for twelve years; and this would
be contrary to what has been declared, to the effect that ‘Rites in
honour of the Pitṛs should be performed till death.’ (Verse 279).—(272)

‘*Kālaśāka*’—Buhler has misread Medhātithi; there is no such expression
in Medhātithi as ‘*Kṛṣṇavāsudeva*’; the word used is *Kṛṣṇe
vāstukabhede*, which means ‘the darker variety of the *vāstuka* herb’.
According to Nandana, it stands for the ‘Black
*neem*’.—*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 706) quoting the verse, explains
it as ‘well known in the northern country’.

‘*Mahāśalka*’—Medhātithi explains this as ‘*śalyakā*’, ‘the porcupine’,
or (according to ‘others’, a *kind of fish*). \[Medhātithi says nothing
as to ‘others’ *reading ‘saśalkhān*’\].—*Parāśaramādhava* explains it as
‘a particular kind of fish’;—‘*loha*’ as ‘the red-coloured goat’—and
‘*munyanna*’ as ‘*Nīvāra* and the like’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 541 and 586);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 14), which says that according to the
‘ancients’, ‘*mahāśalka*’ stands for the *Rohita* fish;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 536).

‘*Whatever*’—*food*—‘*mixed with honey*;’—‘*on the thirteenth day,
during the rains*, *and under the asterism of Maghā*,’—‘*that is
imperishable*,’ The season, the asterism and the date are to be taken
together as the desired qualification.

According to the declaration of Āpastamba, the same holds good regarding
offerings made during the rains, on the thirteenth, eighth and tenth
days of the month also. As regards the asterism of Maghā, however, there
is no option; as he says—‘there is abundance under the asterism of
Maghā,’ (Āpastamba, 2.8.19-20).—(273)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 117) without comment;—in

‘*trayodaśīm*’ has the force of the Locative;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.

‘whatever mixed with Honey is offered on the thirteenth of the month,

What is said here is with reference to the thirteenth day of the month
spoken of above, as accompanied by the rainy season and the asterism of
*Maghā*.

What is described in the text is the wish expressed by the Pitṛs.

‘*May there be*’—born—‘*in our famity*’—one such person, endowed with
excellent qualities, who may offer to us, on the said thirteenth day,
‘*milk-rice mixed with honey and butter*;’—also ‘*when the shadow of the
elephant falls towards the east*;’ *i.e*., during the afternoon; towards
the close of day, the shadow cast by the elephant is long and falls
towards the East.

Another reading for ‘*prākchāyā*’ is ‘*prākchāyām*;’ it is in a shady
place that Brāhmaṇas are fed; as for the rest of the rite, if the shade
is not enough to permit of its being done there, then it should be done
in a place close to the shadow. Since the details form part of the rite,
the whole of it should, as far as possible, be performed in the shadow
of the elephant.

Some people have explained the term ‘shadow of the elephant’ to mean
‘eclipse,’ adding that Rāhu takes the shape of the elephant and pierces
the sun with darkness.

But this is not right; as in that case, the term ‘elephant’ will have to
ba regarded as figurative. Further, in another *Smṛti* the ‘elephant’s
shadow’ has been described as something entirely different from
eclipse:—‘the elephant’s shadow, the eclipse of the Sun, and the eclipse
of the Moon’ \[where the three are mentioned as distinct from one
another\].—(274)

‘*Prākchāye kuñjarasya*’—‘In the afternoon, when the shadow cast by the
elephant falls towards the East’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda);—‘daring an eclipse’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi, who rejects
it).—*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.218) quotes a definition by which the name
applies to a particular day—

&gt; yadenduḥ pitṛdaivatye haṃsaścaiva kare sthitaḥ \|  
&gt; yāmyāṃ tithirbhavetsāhi gajacchāyā prakīrtitā \|\|

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 109), which quotes from
*Vāyupurāṇa* a definition of ‘*Gajacchāyā*’ as the 13th day of the month
during which the sun lies in the asterism of Hastā, and the moon in that
of Maghā;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 245);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
271), which explains ‘*dadyāt*’ as ‘*dadāti*’ and ‘*prākchāye etc*.’ as
‘when the shadow of the elephant is cast towards the East,’ and notes
that this is mere *Arthavāda*;—and in *Vaṛṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 355).

‘*Whatever*.’—This term sanctions the offering of everything, not
actually prohibited.

‘*According to rule*’ is a reiteration of what has been said by means of
the term, ‘*in the right manner*.’

‘*Endowed with faith*’— This is what is actually prescribed in the
present verse:—‘one should make the offering with due faith.’

What is given in this manner ‘*becomes endless and inexhaustible for the
Pitṛs in the other world*.’ ‘Endless’ may be taken as denying all
limitation of time;—‘*Inexhaustible*’ denies non-diminishing of
quantity; the sense being ‘it lasts for all time and becomes large in
quantity.’—(275)

*Baudhāyana* (2.62-65).—‘The gods desirous of purity do not accept the
offerings of the faithless. The gods discussed the relative merits of
the person who is pure but faithless and he who is not pure but full of
faith, and came to the conclusion that both were equal; hut Prajāpati
said to them: “They are not equal; there is great difference; as the
Śrāddha offered by the faithless is damned; what is sanctified by faith
is distinctly superior.” In this connection, they have the following
saying—Want of faith is a great sin; faith is the highest austerity;
therefore, what is offered without faith, the gods never accept.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.188.72, 79).—‘Those men who offer Śrāddhas with due
faith save their forefathers from the most terrible hell; he who
performs the Śrāddha with faith becomes freed from the debt owing to the
Pitṛs.’

what one should do in the event of his being unable to perform the
*Śrāddha* throughout the dark fortnight;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 524),

the *Śrāddha* on the *fifth* and going on daily till the *fifteenth*;—in
*Smṛtitattva* (on p. 173, again on p. 252) as forbidding the performance
of *Śrāddha* on the fourteenth,—and again on p. 845 as forbidding the
performance of the *Śrāddha* on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight
of all months;—in *Aparārka* (p. 422), which adds that the alternative
here laid down is that of beginning the performance of the *Śrāddha* on
the tenth day of the fortnight;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 467),
which says that it refers to the *Mahālayā-śrāddha*;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p, 187) in support of the view that only five, *not
ten*, days of the *kṛṣṇapakṣa* are specially commended, these being the
10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 15th days;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.

not to be excluded entirely, it is to be avoided only for the Śrāddha to
three ‘deities’ with the exception of that offered to those killed with
weapons;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 194).

*Gautama* (15.2-3).—‘Commencing from the fifth day of the Aparapakṣa,
Śrāddha should bo performed;—or on all days.’

*Āpastamba* (2.16.6).—‘So also during the later days of the Aparapakṣa.’

*Kātyāyana and Gautama* (quoted in Caturvargacintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p.
293).—‘One should make the offering to the Pitṛs on the moonless day; or
on the days commencing from the fifth of the *Aparapakṣa*; or according
as he may have faith, on all days, whenever the right substance, place
and Brāhmaṇas may be available.’

*Āpastamba* (quoted in Caturvargacintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 194).—‘It should
be offered every month; the afternoon of the Aparapakṣa is highly
commendable, as also the latter days of the Aparapakṣa.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.264).—‘Commencing from the first day, excepting the
fourteenth day; on this latter day it is offered to those who may have
been killed by weapons.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 663).—‘When the sun is in the sign of
Virgo, there are fifteen days, on which the performance of Śrāddha has
been prescribed;—on the first day, for obtaining wealth; on the second,
for obtaining progeny; on the third, for obtaining good things; on the
fourth for destruction of enemies; on the fifth, for obtaining
prosperity; on the sixth, the man obtains honour; on the seventh, the
man becomes leader of his clan; on the eighth, excellent intelligence;
on the ninth he obtains excellent wives; on the tenth, he fulfils all
his desires; on the eleventh, he acquires all the Vedas; on the twelfth,
he obtains gold; by offering it on the thirteenth day, he obtains
children, memory, cattle, sound body, freedom, excellent prosperity,
long-life, power and riches. Those who seek the welfare of those
ancestors who were killed in youth by weapons should offer the Śrāddha
on the fourteenth day. The man offering Śrāddha with food on the
moonless day obtains all that he desires and goes to heaven.’

*Vṛddha-Manu* (Do.).—‘When the sun enters the sign of Virgo, the dark
fortnight is called the *Mahālaya*, as also the *Gajacchāyā*.’

*Śāṭyāyani* (Do., p. 664.).—‘The sixteen days during the month of
Nabhasya, when the sun is in the sign of Virgo, constitute the time for
the performance of Śrāddha.’

*Śāṭyāyani* (Do., p. 665).—‘The sun in Virgo is very sacred; so also is
the fifth fortnight (after Āṣāḍhī).’

*Devala* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 665.).—‘Sixteen days, formed by the first
day of the bright fortnight, which follow the moonless day.’

*Jābāli* (Do., p. 665).—‘During the fifth fortnight following the
full-moon day of Āṣāḍha,—even though the sun may have not entered the
sign of Virgo, one should offer Śrāddha; that fortnight is the most
commended for the performance of Śrāddha.’

*Bṛhat-Manu* (Do.).—‘During the fifth fortnight after the fullmoon day
of the month of Āṣāḍha, the Pitṛs desire food and water every day; hence
Śrāddha should be offered at that time... even though the sun may or may
not have entered the sign of Virgo.’

*Ādityapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘Śrāddha is commended even when performed during
other fortnights during the time that the sun is in the sign of Virgo;
if this happens to ho the fifth fortnight (after the full-moon day of
Āṣāḍha), it is all the more commendable.’

*Shloka-Gautama* (Do.).—‘During the time when the sun is in the sign of
Virgo, there are sixteen days that are as good as sacrificial sessions.’

*Kārṣṇājini* (Do.).—‘Whether in the beginning or the middle or the end,
whenever the sun enters the sign of Virgo, the whole of that fortnight
is to be honoured as regards the performance of Śrāddha. During the dark
fortnight of Nabhasya, Śrāddha should he performed every day, not
excepting the Nandā or even the fourteenth day.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 666).—‘During the dark fortnight
of the month of Nabhasya, one should perform Śrāddha every day, or
during two-thirds, or during one-half, or during one-third of the
fortnight.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 667).—‘During the rains, when the sun is in the sign of
Virgo,—the man shall offer Śrāddha between the fifth day of one
fortnight and the fifth day of another.’

*Sumantu* (Do.).—‘So long as the sun remains in the sign of Virgo and
until he enters the sign of Scorpio, it is time for the offering of
Śrāddha.’

*Purāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 667).—‘When the sun enters the sign of
Virgo, Pitṛs come to their descendants; till the entering of the sun
into the sign of Scorpio, the region of Pitṛs becomes empty; and on the
entrance of the sun into Scorpio, they go away disappointed after having
cursed their offspring.’

*Ādipurāṇa* (Do.).—‘During the rainy season the Pitṛs empty their
abodes, and oppressed by hunger, describe their own sins and desire
milk-rice mixed with honey; and hence one should satisfy the Pitṛs with
offerings of milk-rice, mixed with honey, butter and sesamum.’

*Gārgya* (Do., 668).—‘On the *Nandā* days (1st, 6th and 11th of the
month), on Friday and on the thirteenth day, the householder should not
perform Śrāddha.’

*Aṅgiras* (Do.).—‘On the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight, if one
offers Śrāddha, the death of his eldest son is certain. If one offers
Śrāddha during the asterism of Maghā, his eldest son dies.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Do., p. 669).—‘If one offers Śrāddha on the thirteenth,
he should offer it not to one Pitṛ; he shall offer the Pārvaṇa Śrāddha.’

*Śaṅkha* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 669).—‘On the expiry of the month of
Bhādra, or the thirteenth day in conjunction with the asterism of Maghā,
one should offer Śrāddha with honey and milk-rice; his forefathers
reward him with desirable progeny, fame, heaven, health, and wealth.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do.).—‘If a man performs Śrāddha on the thirteenth, no
one in his family ever dies young.’

*Marīci* (Do., p. 670).—‘On the fourteenth, Śrāddha should be offered
only to those who have died through poison, weapons or wild animals, or
those who have killed a Brāhmaṇa; for others that day has been
condemned.’

*Pracetas* (Do.).—‘The fourteenth has been recommended only for those
who died through tree-climbing or iron weapons, or lightning or water or
poison and such things.’

*Sumanta* (Parāśaramadhava, p. 670).—‘Even the Unitary Śrāddha for one
who has died through weapons should be performed on the fourteenth day
of the Mahālaya.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.16.8-22).—‘If one performs the Śrāddha on the
first day, he obtains children most of whom are female; if on the second
day, he obtains children who become thieves; if on the third day, he
obtains children endowed with Brāhmic glory; if on the fourth day, he
obtains cattle of poor quality; if on the fifth day, he obtains male
children, many in number and he does not die childless; if on the sixth

and lead; if on ṭhe twelfth, he obtains much cattle; if on the
thirteenth, he obtains many sons, many friends, beautiful children; if
on the fourteenth, he prospers in weapons; if on the fifteenth, he

*Viṣṇu* (78.36-49).—‘On the first he obtains house and beautiful wives;
on the second, a girl bestowing benefits; on the third, all desirable
things; on the fourth, cattle; on the fifth, beautiful sons; on the
sixth, success in gambling; on the seventh, success in agriculture; on

‘*Fortner* *halt of the month*’ is the brighter fortnight; and ‘*latter
half*’ is the darker fortnight;—months being counted from the brighter
fortnight of *Caitra* onwards.

Just as, for purposes of Śrāddha, the darker fortnight is preferable
to—is productive of better results than -the brighter fortnight, so is
the afternoon preferable to the forenoon. From the declaration of this
‘preference,’ it follows that in some cases one might perform a
*śrāddha* during the forenoon also.

“As a rule, the illustration should be well known; as a matter of fact,
however, nowhere has the text declared the superiority of the darker
fortnight to the brighter fortnight, for purposes of *Śrāddha*. \[Hence
the illustration is not apt\].”

Some people explain that the said superiority is understood from what
has been said under 276, regarding the ‘darker fortnight’ and ‘days
beginning with the tenth.’ Our explanation, however, is as
follows:—According to the principle laid down in *Mīmāṃsāsūtra* 3. 5.
21, even an unknown fact can serve as an illustration; so that, in the
case in question, from the citation of the illustration itself we may
even deduce the necessary injunction (regarding the performance of
*Sharddhas* ( *Śrāddhas*?) during the darker fortnight).—(278)

*Medhātithi* (P. 297, l. 16)—‘*Vacanāni tvapūrvatvāt*.’—This is Mīmāṃsā
sūtra 3.5.21. The question arising as to whether or not there should be
an ‘eating of remnants’ in the case of the *Soma juice*,—the conclusion
is that there should be the eating of it; and this conclusion is based
upon a passage referring to a totally different subject; which shows
that even an unknown fact can serve as an illustration in support of a
definite conclusion.

This verse is quoted in *Kālaviveka* (p. 366), which explains that the
precise meaning of the verse is that ‘from the three parts into which
the day is divided, forenoon, mid-day and afternoon, the afternoon is
superior to the other two.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 465), which adds that the term
‘*aparāhṇa*’ stands here, not for the fourth part of the day divided
into five parts, but simply for ‘the latter half of the day,’ which is
its etymological meaning;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 373);—in
*Śrāddhakriyakaumudī* (p. 314);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 236);—in

‘*Ānidhanāt*’—‘Until death’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘up at to the
end of the ceremony’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 725) in support of
the view that ‘all the detailed Śrāddha rites beginning with the pouring
of water round the dish to the end should be done while one has his
thread hanging on his right, shoulder’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
345), which explains ‘*atandriṇā*’ as ‘without laziness,’—‘*ānidhanāt*’
as ‘*beginning* with death,’ adding that the Maithilas explain this to
mean ‘till the end of the ceremony’;—in *Śrāddho* *kriyākaumudi* (p.
44), which explains ‘*apasavyam*’ as

‘*vāmāvartakrameṇa*,’ and ‘*ānidhanāt*’ as ‘to the end of the Śrāddha.’

*Smṛtitattva* quotes this verse on p. 185, in support of the view that
the *Ulkā-bhramaṇa*, ‘Brandishing of the Firebrand,’ which is done on
the fifteenth day of *Kārtika*, being an act done in honour of the
Pitṛs, should be done with the sacred thread passing over the right,
shoulder;—again on p. 231, in support of the view that the reciting of
certain hymns that is laid down as to be done during the *Śrāddha*,
should be done with the sacred thread passing over the right
shoulder;—again on p. 236, where it is explained that ‘*apasavya*’ means
‘*pitṛ-tīrtha,’ i.e*., the part of the palm between the thumb and the
index-finger;—and again in vol. II, p. 303, in support of the view that
all the rites that are performed ‘*after death*’ (*ānidhanāt*) should be
done with the sacred thread passing over the right shoulder.

It is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 527), which reads
‘*atantriṇā*’ and explains it as ‘*anolasena*,’ and ‘*apasavyam*’ as ‘on
the left side,’ ‘*ānidhanāt*’ as ‘till the end of the performance’;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 24b);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1107),
which has the following notes:—‘*Prācīnāvītinā*,’ with the sacred thread
hanging over the right shoulder and under the left
arm-pit,—‘*ānidhanāt*,’ ‘till the end,’—‘*darbhapāṇinā*,’ is added with
a view to show that everything that is done for the sake of the *Pitṛs*
should be done kuśa in hand.

*Objection*—“Inasmuch as it has been laid down that *Śrāddhas* shall be
performed in the afternoon, where was there any possibility of
performance *at night* (that it should have been considered necessary to
prohibit it)? It might be argued that the specification of the time
itself implies the possibility of performance at other times also. This
may be true; but the specification contained in the words, ‘the
afternoon is preferable to the forenoon,’ (278) clearly indicates that
the performance is possible only at that time, in comparison with which
the prescribed time has been declared to be ‘preferable;’ so that the
only other time at which the *Śrāddha* might be performed is the
*forenoon* (and never the *night*).”

In answer to this, some people offer the following explanation:—The
present text serves to prohibit the performance at night, which might be
possible under the direction that Śrāddhas shall be performed during
lunar and solar eclipses. So that there being *prohibition* regarding
the twilights and the night, and *sanction* regarding lunar and solar
eclipses, there is option between the. two twilights and the two
eclipses, as also between the lunar eclipse and night.

Others, however, have explained that ‘midday’ is a time different from
both ‘afternoon’ and ‘forenoon;’ and the present prohibition implies
that there should be no performance at that time also.

‘*When the sun has just risen*,’—the time being the forenoon, the
prohibition applies to the first rising of the sun.

‘*Fit for demons*’—this is a purely reiterative exaggeration.—(280).

In accordance with the rules laid down here—*i.e*., following the
procedure, beginning with inviting the Brāhmaṇas on the previous day,
and ending with performing the *Śrāddha* thrice in the year—one should
offer the *Śrāddha*—in what months *?*—‘*during winter, summer and the
rains*.’

What is said here regarding the *Śrāddha* to be offered ‘thrice in the
year’ is to be regarded as optional with what has been said above (122)
regarding its being offered ‘month after month.’

‘*That which forms part of the Five Sacrifices*’—that which has been
prescribed among the ‘Five Sacrifices’—should be performed every day.

In connection with this last, the only procedure to be adopted consists
in—(*a*) wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder, (*b*) making
offerings from left to right, and (*c*) feeding the Brāhmaṇas with face
towards the north. That is why it has been re-mentioned here.

It is in view of this text that older people have explained that the
rule regarding the offering of *Śrāddha* thrice in the year is meant for
one who has not set up the fire. But what authority they have for this,
they alone know.—(281)

The ‘Homa,’ ‘oblation into fire,’ offered in connection with the Rite in
honour of the Pitṛs is called ‘*Paitṛyajñikahoma*;’—this ‘*has not been
prescribed as to be offered into the common*’—*i.e*., the
*Smārta*—‘*fire*.’ That is, the Scriptures do not enjoin it as to be
done in that manner. Hence it follows that the offering of *Śrāddha*
‘three times during the year’ is to be made by one who has not set up
the Fire. Though this offering three times would be ‘offering into the
common Fire,’ yet it would be as good as ‘*not done*,’ in comparison
with what is done throughout the year. For instance, when a man who can
eat a seer has eaten less, people are found to say, ‘he has not eaten.’

Older commentators have explained this as a reiterative supplement to
what has gone in the preceding verse.

The right view to take, however, appears to be that what is said in the
text is that the oblation into Fire, in connection with *Śrāddhas*,
should not be offered into the ‘common Fire,’—*i.e*., such fire as has
not been set up at marriage or other prescribed times. And this
prohibition of the ‘oblation into Fire’ implies that details other than
that may be done in the common fire. If such were not the meaning, then,
in view of the fact that the ‘oblation into fire,’ offered by the person
who has set up the fire, has been prescribed as part of the
*Pārvaṇa-Śrāddha*, the person who has not set up the Fire would not be
entitled to the performance of *Śrāddhas* at all; just as, in view of
the fact that the blind person cannot do the ‘looking into the butter,’
he is not entitled to the performance of the *Darśa Pūrṇamāsa*
sacrifi-ces. If it be, as we have explained it, then it comes to this
that the *Śrāddha* performed by the man who has set up the fire would be
accompanied by oblations into fire, while that performed by one. who has
not set up the fire would be without such oblations. And in this, case,
what is said here falls within what has been said in verse 212 above.

Some people have offered the following explanation:—“What is meant here
is the *Piṇḍapitṛyajña*; and the oblation into fire that is offered at
this is never offered into the Common Fire.”

Others have said that this is not right, for even so the person who has
not set up the Fire might cook the oblation day by day and then offer
it.

Others, again, assert that, in view of the phrase, ‘*apart from the
Moonless Day*,’ it follows that by the person who has set up the Fire
the *Śrāddha* should be offered every month; and that the rule regarding
‘three times in the year’ does not apply to him.

Others, again, have declared that such is not the reading.

What then is the meaning?

The meaning is that, apart from the *Śrāddha* performed on the Moonless
Day, no other *Śrāddha*—such as the ‘*Maghā-Śrāddha*,’ and the like—is
binding upon him; the former alone being necessary for him. For the
person who has not set up the Fire, however, the *Śrāddhas* prescribed
in connection with the winter, etc., also are obligatory.—(282)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* on p. 174, as laying down that the
Śrāddha during the ‘dark fortnight’ should be preformed on the Moonless
Day;—on p. 35, II, as precluding the offering of Homa-libations in the
ordinary fire;—and again on II, p. 136, to the same effect.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 615), which remarks that it
appears as if it were forbidding the performance of Śrāddha by a man
‘with the Fire’ on any but the Moonless Day; and proceeds to note that
some people have taken this to mean that if a Śrāddha happens to fall on
any other day, the man ‘with the Fire’ should do the ‘*saṅkalpa*’ on
that day, but postpone the actual performance till the Moonless Day;—but
trustworthy people have held that what is meant is that for the man
‘with the Fire,’ even if there should arise the necessity of performing
a Śrāddha on another day, he should always wait till the Moonless Day.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 111) which remarks that the
first half assigns the reason for what is asserted in the second half.
It quotes three opinions—(1) Some people accept this verse in its
literal sense; (2) ‘our teachers’ hold that it is meant to forbid for
the man ‘with the fire’ the performance of that Śrāddha only which is
done in the form of the ‘*Piṇḍapitṛyajña*’;—(3) ‘our own opinion’ is
that it serves to lay down that if any Śrāddha happens to fall on other
days, the Man ‘with the fire’ should do it on the Moonless Day’;—in
*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 369), which reproduces the note from
*Hemādri*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1679) which explains the meaning
as—‘The Agnihotri should not perform any Śrāddha in which the
ritualistic details of the *Darśa-Śrāddha* are not adopted’; that is, he
should perform the Śrāddha only in the manner of the *Darśa-Śrāddha*; it
does *not* mean that ‘he should not perform any Śrāddha except the
Darśa’;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 7), which rejects the view set
forth by *Hemādri*, attributing it to Halāyudha.

taken to the fire shall make the offerings into the Dakṣiṇāgni; one who
is without the fire shall do it either in the Upasada fire, or, in the
absence of fire, into the hands of a Brāhmaṇa, or in water.’

of Homa, or having kindled the ordinary fire simply for the purpose of
having a fire, he shall offer the oblations for the accomplishment of
the rite.’

Smārta rites in the marriage-fire, or in the fire kindled at the time of
inheritance; and the Śrauta rites in the sacrificial fire.’

Do. (1(?).236).—‘When going to pour the oblation into the fire, he shall
take up the food overflowing with butter, and being permitted to go on
with the offering, shall pour the oblation into the fire, in the manner
of the Pitṛyajña.’
