Inasmuch as the meaning of the term ‘*Atithi*’ (guest) is not well-known
among men, the author provides a definition of the same.

One becomes a ‘guest’ by staying in another man’s house for one night;
and this character belongs only to a Brāhmaṇa, to none else.

Whether the next day also the guest should be honoured or not, depends
upon the wish of the Householder; it is not. obligatory. It being done
by persons desiring prosperity, the incentive to it is something totally
different (from that of the obligatory honouring during the first
night). Says Apastamba (2.7.16)—‘One should lodge him for one night;’
whereby he wins the regions of the earth; by keeping him on the second
night, the regions of the sky; and on the third night, the regions of
Heaven”—which shows that the incentive to the entertaining of the guest
on the second and following nights consists in the desire for particular
rewards.

For the purpose of lending strength to the above explanation, the author
provides the etymological meaning—‘*His stay is not long*; which means
that the word ‘*atithi*’ is derived from the root ‘*sthā*’ (to stay),
preceded by ‘*ati*;’ the term being formed somehow by the addition of an
*Uṇādi* affix.—(102)

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
351) in support of the view that a guest is to be treated as such only
on the day on which he arrives, not if he stays till the next day.

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 438) as explaining
what is meant by the term ‘*atithi*’ (guest);—in *Aparārka* (p. 155);—in
*Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 676 and Śrāddha, p. 427).

**(verses 3.102-103)**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.7,8).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Viṣṇu* (67.34, 35).—\[Do.\]

*Gautama* (5.41).—‘The guest, *Atithi*, is one who is not an inhabitant
of the same village, who arrives at the time when the sun is just
sinking below the tree-tops, and who stays for one night only.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 438).—‘That high-souled man who has
renounced all observances relating to particular dates of the month, to
special days of worship and to special festivals, is the *Atithi*,
guest, for all beings; others are only *Abhyāgatas*, arrivals.’

*Markaṇḍeya* (Do.).—‘Neither a friend, nor an inhabitant of the same
village, should he treated as a *guest*; that Brāhmaṇa is called a
*guest*, whose name and family are not known to the householder, who
arrives by chance at the time, hungry, fatigued, without any belongings,
seeking for food.’

*Mahābhārata* (Āśvamedhika, Do.).—‘To one who is suffering from hunger
and thirst, who has arrived at the right time and the right place, he
shall offer food after having welcomed him with due respect. Him should
he regard as a guest who has come from a distance, at the time of the
Vaiśvadeva offering.’

*Parāśara* (Ācāra, 9.41, 42).—‘One who has come from a distance, is
fatigued and has arrived at the time of the Vaiśvadeva offering,—shall
be regarded as a *guest*, not one who has come previously. One should
never receive a co-villager as a guest; because a guest, *Atithi*, is so
called because he does not come always.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.6.5).—‘To one who is a householder, firm in
his duties, if some one comes without any purpose, he is a guest whose
reception is a sacred duty.’

*Vyāsa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 351).—‘That man is honoured as a guest who
has come to one’s house from a distance, suffering from hunger, thirst
and fatigue.’

*Pracetas* (Do.).—‘One who arrives in the evening, or at the end of the
Vaiśvadeva offering, is to be honoured like a god; brought up by the
sun, he is called the *guest*.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 352).—‘One shall honour as guest
that person who comes to one’s house, whose family or name is not
known,—who is not an inhabitant of the same village; he should be one
who is not related to the householder; he should be one who has nothing
with him, and has come from another country.’

One who fives in the same village is not a ‘guest,’ even though he may
happen to come just at the time of the ‘Vaiśvadeva’ offerings.

‘*Companion*’—a fellow-student, other than one’s ‘friend;’ the rule
regarding the entertaining of the latter will come later—‘the Vaiśya and
the Śūdra and one’s friend, &c., &c.’ (Verse 110).

It appears right to take the term ‘*sāṅgatika*’ as excluding the man who
is in the habit of meeting all men on terms of equality, entertaining
them with jokes ami stories,—oven though he be such as has never been
met before.

For the Householder, when away from home, no one can be a ‘guest,’ even
though he may fulfil all the conditions of one; one is to be regarded as
such only when he ‘*arrives at one’s house*;’ *i.e*., to the place where
one lives permanently, that which is called his ‘abode.’ But even when
the man is away from home, if his wife and Fires happen to be there,
then the Brāhmaṇa arriving will be his ‘guest,’ even though he himself
may not be there. Hence the householder should provide for the
entertaining of guests during his absence, in the same manner as he does
for the maintenance of the Fires and the performance of the
*Darśa-Pūrṇmāsa* and other periodical sacrifices.

The term ‘or’ implies that (*a*) when the man goes on a journey taking
his wife and the fires with him, then, even during his stay in another
village, if some one arrives, he should be treated as a ‘guest;”—(*b*)
that the same is the case at his own house, during his absence, if his
wife and Fires are there that hence, when one goes out with his wife,
but leaves the Fires at home, the rule regarding the entertaining of
guests does not apply.

The term ‘or’ is to be construed with ‘should regard’ not as between the
‘wife’ and the ‘fires.’—(103)

‘*Sāṅgatikam*’—‘Fellow-student, other than a *friend*; or one who is in
the habit of meeting all men on terms of equality, entertaining, them
with jokes and stories.’ \[Medhātithi; whom Buhler quotes wrongly by
including ‘the Vaiśya or a Śūdra or a friend’ in the latter explanation;
the word ‘*vaiśyaśūdrau sahhā cheti*’ stands for verse 110, where,
Medhātithi says, ‘the rule regarding the entertaining of a *Friend* will
come in’\];—‘One who makes a living by telling wonderful or laughable
stories and the like’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘one who
comes on account of his relationship to the Householder’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Bhāryā yatrāgnayaḥ*’—‘Where the wife and the fires are at the time’
(Medhātithi);—‘when the man who has arrived is accompanied by his Wife
and Fires’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa). Buhler is again in the wrong in
translating Kullūka’s view. What Kullūka says is “*etena
bhāryāgnirahitasya pravāsino nātithitvamiti bodhitam*”—*i.e*., ‘what is
meant is that the character of a *guest* does not belong to that
wanderer from home, who is devoid of wife and fires’; and *not* (as
Buhler puts it) that ‘a Householder who has neither (wife or fires) need
not entertain guests.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 353), which adds
the following notes:—An inhabitant of the same village, even though he
may arrive in the character of a guest, is not to be entertained as
such;—similarly, the ‘*Sāṅgatika*,’ *i.e*., ‘an old acquaintance,’—is
not to be treated as a guest, if he happens to arrive as one;—an arrival
is to be treated as a guest only when he comes to the house—either his
own or some one else’s—where the Householder’s ‘wife and fires’ happen
to be at the time.

‘*Waiting upon*’ means attending repeatedly. Some Brāhmaṇas wander from
house to house with a view to the fact that at such and such a house the
guest is sure to be fed; and it is this that is deprecated in the
present verse.

One who is in the habit of waiting upon the food cooked for others,—rand
not one who happens to do it only once by the way,—‘*on that
account*’—by reason of that act—‘*after death, cattle*’—are born as a
bull, &c., in the house of the ‘*givers of food*;’ *i.e*., are born as
his elephant, mule or horse.

This is a defect only in the Householder, who has established his own
domestic hearth.—(104)

‘*Evening*’—is the time of sunset, the beginning of night. At that time
if a guest arrives, he ‘*should not be driven away*’ he should not be
refused admission; *i.e*., he should be entertained with food, bed,
seat, and so forth.—“By whom *?*”—‘*By the householder*’—‘*medha*’ means
*sacrifice*; ‘*gṛhamedha*’ is the name applied to the Five Great
Sacrifices; one who is entitled to these is the ‘*gṛhamedhin*,’ the
Householder.

‘*Brought by the sun*’—this is purely laudatory. ‘*Brought*’—made to
arrive—‘*by the sun*.’ Being brought by a god, he certainly deserves
honour.

‘*In time*’—*i.e*., the second part of the day; the time at which the
Vaiśvadeva offerings are made. ‘*Not in time*’—in the evening; after
breakfast has been finished.

‘*He should not stay in his*’— the householder’s—‘*house, without taking
food*.’ If there is any food left, that should be offered to him; if
not, food should be cooked afresh.—(105)

Vaiśvadeva offerings, or in the evening, should be honoured as a god,—he
being called *a guest brought by the sun*.’

*Āpastamba* (Aparārka, p. 152).—‘If any one comes seeking for food, the
master and mistress of the house shall not refuse him; if there is no
food, they should offer place, water, grasses and sweet words.’

Soup, butter, curds, sugar, and such other rich food, he himself should
not eat, so long as he does not offer it to the guest that may have
arrived. As for gruel and such other bitter medicinal drinks, he shall
not offer these to him, if he does not desire it; there is no harm in
the man taking these without offering them to the guest. All that this
means is that he should uot himself eat rich food and offer to the guest
poor fare.

‘*Conducive to wealth*’— procures, brings, wealth. Similarly,
‘*conducive to fame*,’ and so forth.

All this is purely laudatory; because the honouring of guests is a
compulsory duty, if he happen to be there, and also because what is here
said is clearly supplementary to the foregoing injunction (of
guest-honouring). And so long us a passage can be taken as purely
laudatory, there is no justification for taking it as putting forward
another incentive.—(106)

them should not all be of the same quality; they should be in accordance

‘*Seat*’— the mat, and so forth.

‘*Room*’—place for resting.

‘*Bed*’—bedstead, &c.

‘*Following*’— going after him when he goes.

All this should be ‘*of the best kind, to superiors*.’ &e.,—*i.e*., the
superior guest should be followed to a great distance; the medium guest,
not very far: and the inferior, only a few steps.—(107)

*Gautama* (5.39,40).—‘Bedding, seat, lodging, following and attendance,
in the same manner as in the case of elders;—in the case of inferior
persons, all this has to be done even to a small extent.’

*Baudhāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 452).—‘Both morning and evening,
whatever food there may be, with that he shall make the Vaiśvadeva
offerings and then entertain, to the best of his capacity, such
Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra guests as may happen to arrive; in
the event of his being unable to entertain several guests, he may offer
the food to only one of them, either to one who may be the best
qualified among them, or to him who may have been the first to arrive.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Do.).—‘A non-Brāhmaṇa is not to be treated as the
guest of a Brāhmaṇa; it is only the learned and highly qualified
Brāhmaṇa that deserves the honours of a *guest*; the Kṣatriya and the
Vaiśya are to be received as friends; and the Śūdra is to be entertained
only out of kindness and sympathy.’

*Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p. 157).—‘One shall sit with him, at night he shall
retire to sleep on being permitted by him, rise before him, and follow
him when he leaves, turning back only when he asks him to do so.’

Food cooked for all is referred to here by the term ‘*Vaiśvadeva*;’ on
this being ‘*finished*’—*i.e*., all persons having eaten, and the food
having been exhausted,—if another guest should arrive, then for him also
he shall provide cooked food; but out of this latter food, he shall not
make the offering that is made out of food that is cooked in the
household.

The oblation into the tire also—and not only the *offering*—is not to be
made (out of this food); because oblations and offerings have been laid
down as to be made out of the food cooked in the morning and evening,
and not out of the intervening cookings; as is going to be asserted
below (in verse 121). So that, if one happens to cook several times
during the day, he should not repeat the *Vaiśvadeva* offering with each
cooking.

‘*To the best of his ability*’—*i.e*., with elaborate seasonings or
otherwise.—(108)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on l. 103, p. 76) in support of the
view that the Vaiśvadeva offering is not meant to be sanctifìcatory of
the food; it is performed only for the accomplishing of certain
desirable ends for the Householder—*e.g*., what is mentioned under 2.28.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 311) quotes it, and adds the following note:—The
*Vaiśvadeva* offering having been made, and one guest having been duly
entertained, if a second one happens to arrive, and there is no cooked
food left for him, then food should be cooked for him; but out of this
latter no *Vaiśvadeva* offering need be made. If this offering were
meant to be sanctificatory of the food, then it would be necessary to
make it each time the food might be prepared; and the prohibition of the
second offering can be justified only if it is *not* sanctificatory of
the food. Some people have held that this offering has the dual
character (a) of being sanctificatory of the food, and (b) of fulfilling
a desirable purpose for the man.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 305), which also adds that the
interdicting of the second *Vaiśvadeva* offering clearly indicates that
it is not regarded as sanctificatory of the food;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*
(p. 924), which explains ‘*nivṛtte*’ as ‘after taking his food’;—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 284), which adds the following explanation:—‘Where
the Vaiśvadeva offering has been made and the Honouring of the guest
also done, if another guest arrives and there is no cooked food left,
then another food should be cooked and offered to him, but the
Vaiśvadeva offering need not be made out of this second instalment of
cooking.’

This verse contains an advice offered, by the way, to the guest.

Seeking for food, he shall not say—‘I belong to such and such a family,
I am the son of so and son; in this fashion he shall not advertise his
‘family or *gotra*.’ The ‘*family*’ consists of his father, grandfather,
and so forth;—‘*gotra*’—may stand either for such Ṛṣi-names as
‘*Garga*,’ ‘*Bhārgava*,’ etc.; or for one’s *name*. That the term
‘*gotra*’ means *name* also is shown by such usage as ‘mistake in
names,’ ‘*gotraskhalita*’ which term is used in the event of a man
pronouncing a name other than the one he intended to pronounce.

His ‘learning’ also he should not advertise; as this also has been
prohibited in another *Smṛti*.

The Text adds a declamatory, assertion:—‘*For the purpose of obtaining a
meal*’—*i.e*., with the motive that by advertising my family and *gotra*
I shall succeed in obtaining a meal, if one brags about these—*family
and gotra*,—he is called by the wise ‘*Vāntāśin*,’ ‘*feeder-on
filth*,’—he who swallows what has been vomitted.—(109)

Even though a *Kṣatriya*, during his travelling, happen to arrive at the
Brāhmaṇa’s house, at the time of breakfast,—he is not a “guest.” Hence
it is not incumbent upon the Brāhmaṇa to offer food to him.

Similarly with the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*.

The ‘*friend*’ and the ‘*relation*’ are one’s *equals*, not *guests*.

The ‘*Teacher*’ has to be served as the master; as described in the
text—‘the act of cooking should be done after having offered to the
Teacher’ (*Gautama* 5-26).—(110).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 354) in support of
the view that in the house of the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and others are
not to be entertained as regular guests, they are only to have food
offered to them in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 438) to the effect that
wherever the term ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is used in the texts laying down the duty
of entertaining a ‘guest’, it is meant to exclude the *Kṣatriya* and
other castes;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 428).

**(verses 3.110-112)  
**

*Gautama* (5.43).—‘The non-Brāhmaṇa can be the guest of the Brāhmaṇa
only if the former is *one who has been engaged in a sacrifice*.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 452).—‘The non-Brāhmaṇa
cannot be the guest of the Brāhmaṇa; the full honours of the guest are
to be rendered only to the Vedic scholar possessed of special
qualifications; the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya are to be received as
friends; and to the Śūdra something may he offered only by way of
favour, to save him from discomfort.’

*Viṣṇu* (67.36).—\[Reproduces Manu, 111 and 112.\]

*Gautama* (5.44-45).—‘To the Kṣatriya food is to be offered after
Brāhmaṇas; others are to be fed along with servants, as a favour.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.4.18).—‘The Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya (are to
be fed); if a Śūdra happen to arrive, he should be directed to do some
work, and food should be given to him.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.11-13).—‘Morning and evening, whatever food there may
be, out of that he shall make the Vaiśvadeva offerings, and then
entertain, to the best of his power, the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya, the
Vaiśya and the Śūdra that may happen to arrive; but when the Śūdra
arrives, he should be directed to do some work.’

The ‘character’ of the guest consists of—(*a*) having run short of food
during the journey, (*b*) bring in a strange village and (*c*) arriving
at the time of eating. In this character, if a *Kṣatriya* happen to come
to one’s house, then the householder shall feed him also.

By specifically mentioning ‘feeding,’ the other factors of the
‘honouring’ of guests become precluded; but the addressing of agreeable
and wholesome words has been generally enjoined as to be addressed
equally to everyone coming to one’s house. The proper time for feeding
him is this:—he should be fed after the Brāhmaṇas—guests as well as such
non-guests as are entitled to eat first—have eaten.

‘*May*’—this shows the absence of compulsion; the sense being that what
is here laid down is voluntary, not obligatory. And since the reward has
not been mentioned, it follows that Heaven is the reward, as it is in
the case of all those acts whose rewards are not specifically mentioned.
Or, we might connect with this the phrase ‘conducive to wealth, fame,
etc.’ (of verse 106).—(111)

‘*Kāmam*’—May; *i.e*., ‘it is not incumbent upon him; it is left to his
choice’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘as much as the person wishes’
(Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 354) as laying
down what should be done if a *Kṣatriya* comes to one’s house as a
guest;—in *Aparārka* (p. 152) as laying down that the Householder may,
if he likes, entertain guests other than the Brāhmaṇas;—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 440), which notes that this lays down the rule that to the
*Śūdra* thus arrived one should offer the food left in the dishes.

Those that have the character of guests are said to arrive ‘*in the
character of guests*;’ the ‘character of the guest’ has been already
described.

‘*Family*’—House.

‘*Arrived*’—Come.

He should feed the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra* also, like the *Kṣatriya*.
The time, for feeding them is after the quests, relations and friends
have eaten, but before the House-holder and his wife.

‘*Along with*’ means simply ‘at the same time.’

‘*Compassionate disposition*’—sympathy, pity.

‘*Showing*’—providing proof of, having recourse to.

This last clause has been added with a view to show that those here
mentioned are not objects of respect. It is one who is to be kindly
treated that deserves compassion, and not one who is to be worshipped.
Towards pergons deserving kindly treatment, if help can be accorded,
this is done by everyone who desires his own welfare. But its omission
does not mean ill-treatment of the guest. What is meant is that the
merit derived from helping the person deserving compassion is not
similar to that derived from entertaining the guest; it is inferior to
this latter.—(112)
