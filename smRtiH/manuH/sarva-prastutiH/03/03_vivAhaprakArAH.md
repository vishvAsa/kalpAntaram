This is a brief re-capitulation of what is going to be described in
detail.

‘*Beneficial and not-beneficial*’—Some marriages are beneficial, while
others are not so.

‘*Eight*’—this mentions the number.

‘*Marriage of girls*’—*i.e*., marriage which serves as the sacramental
rite for girls.

“What is it that is called *Marriage*?”

It is the name given to a sacramental rite performed for the girl,
obtained by certain means, which serves to make her a wife.

A girl having been obtained by certain means, one performs for her, for
the purpose of making her a *wife*, a sacramental rite, which ends with
the seeing of the constellation of Ursa Major, and is marked by the
holding of hands; and it is this rite, along with its entire procedure
and subsidiary details, that is called ‘Marriage.’—(20).

**(verses 3.20-21)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (1. 11. 1).—‘There are eight marriages.’

*Vasiṣṭha* (1.28-29).—‘There are six marriages,—Brāhma, Daiva, Ārṣa,
Gāndharva, Kṣātra, and Mānuśa.’

*Śaṅkha* (4. 2).—‘Brāhma, Daiva, Ārṣa, Prājāpatya, Āsura, Gāndharva,
Rākṣasa, and Paiśāca, the lowest is the eighth.’

*Nārada* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 846).—‘Eight forms of marriage have
been laid down as a sacrament for several castes: among these the Brāhma
is the first, then comes the Prājāpatya, the Ārṣa, the Daiva, the
Gāndharva, and the Āsura; then come the Rākṣasa and the Paiśāca; the
eighth is the lowest.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘There are eight marriages; Brāhma, Daiva, Gāndharva,
Āsura, Rākṣasa, Paiśāca, Mānuṣa and Kṣātra.’

*Arthaśāstra* (Part II, p. 12).—‘When the girl is adorned and given
away, it is the Brāhma form of marriage;—when the pair perform religious
rites together, it is the Prājāpatya; when a pair of cows is received in
exchange, it is the Ārṣa; when the girl is given away to the Priest
within the altar, it is the Daiva; that which is accomplished by mutual
consent is the Gāndharva; when the giver receives a fee, it is the
Āsura; when the girl is taken away by force, it is the Rākṣasa; when the
girl is taken away while asleep, it is the Paiśāca.’

*Nārada* (12. 38-53).—\[38-39 as in the above-mentioned quotation from
Vīramitrodaya; then\]—‘In the *Brāhma* form, a maiden decked with
ornaments is given to the bridegroom, after he has been invited and
honourably received by the father. When he has been received with the
words—“Carry on your sacred duties together with her,” it is called the
*Prājāpatya* form. When the father receives from the bridegroom, a
dress, a bull and a cow, it is called the *Ārṣa* form. When she is given
before the altar, to a priest officiating at a sacrifice, it is called
the *Daiva* form. The union of a willing maiden with her lover is the
fifth form called *Gāndharva*. When a price is asked for the bride by
her father and received by him, it is the form called *Āsura*. The
*Rākṣasa* form is declared to consist of the forcible abduction of a
maiden. Sexual intercourse with a woman during her sleep, or while she
is unconscious, constitutes the eighth form, the basest of all. Of
these, the first four, beginning with the *Brāhma*, are declared to be
lawful; the *Gāndharva* form is common to all castes; the three forms
that come after it are unlawful. Besides the lawful wives, seven other
kinds of wives are mentioned, who have been previously enjoyed by
another man. Among those, the *Punarbhū* is of three kinds and the
Svairiṇî of four kinds. A maiden, not actually deflowered, but only
joined in wedlock to a former husband by the hand, is the first kind of
*Punarbhū*. She is required to have the marriage-ceremony performed once
more, with her second husband. One who, after having left her husband,
and betaken herself to another man, returns to her husband, is called
the second kind of *Punarbhū*. When a woman, on the failure of
brothers-in-law, is delivered by her relations to a Sapiṇḍa of the same
caste, she is called the third *Punarbhū*. When a woman, with or without
children, goes to live with another man, through love, while her husband
is alive, she is called the first *Svairiṇī*. When the woman, after the
death of her husband, rejects her brother-in-law or other relations, and
unites herself with a stranger, through love, she is called the second
*Svairiṇī*. One who, having come from a foreign country, or having been
purchased with money, or being oppressed with hunger or thirst, gives
herself up to a man, saying “I am thine,” is called the third
*Svairiṇī*. When a woman, after having been given in marriage, by her
elders, in accordance with the custom of her country, becomes forcibly
united with another man, she is called the fourth *Svairiṇī*.’

‘*Lawful*’—that which is not fallen from the law; *i.e*., prescribed by
the scriptures.

‘*What are the good and bad points of each form*’—*i.e*., which points
in each are conducive to desirable and which to undesirable results.

‘*Offspring*’—*i.e*., in the birth of children.

‘*Good effects*’—good qualities. ‘*Bad effects*’—defects. In reality,
the ‘good and bad effects,’ in the form of Heaven and Hell, pertain to
the bridegroom; but here they stand for that which brings about these
effects.

Though this is already implied in what has gone before (in the first
line), yet it is mentioned again for the purpose of making the idea
clearer.—(22)

The first six forms of marriages, in the order in which they have been

The term ‘*Kṣatra*’ stands for the *Kṣatriya*. For him ‘*the last
four*;’ *i.e*., the ‘*Āsura*,’ the ‘*Gāndharva*,’ the ‘*Rākṣasa*,’ and
the *Paiśāca*.’

*i.e*., leaving off the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form.—(23)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 987), which adds
the following explanation:—The six forms of marriage, from the
beginning, are lawful for the Brāhmaṇa, the four beginning with ‘Āsura’
and ending with ‘Paiśāca’ for the Kṣatriya; these latter, with the
exception of the ‘Rākṣasa’ are lawful for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra.

*Aparārka* (p. 91) quotes this and adds that those beginning with Brāhma
and ending with Gāndharva are lawful for the Brāhmaṇa; and the
‘*avarān*’—those named last are lawful for the Kṣatriya; and for the
Vaiśya and Śūdra also these same, excepting the Rākṣasa.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 158) quotes the verse and explains it to mean that
the first six—*i*. e., ‘Brāhma’, ‘Daiva’, ‘Ārṣa’, ‘Prājāpatya’, ‘Āsura’
and ‘Gāndharva’ are, in the order stated, ‘lawful’—*i.e*., not contrary
to law—for the Brāhmaṇa.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 858) quotes the verse and having offered
the same explanation as the above, adds that four of these are the
principal forms recommended, and the other two are only secondary
substitutes.

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 223) quotes the verse and explains that the ‘four’
meant are Āsura, Gāndharva, Rākṣasa and Paiśāca; these, excepting the
Rākṣasa, are lawful for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 100), which adds the following
explanation:—For the Brāhmaṇa, only six forms are commended, beginning
with the *Brāhma* and ending with the *Gāndharva*, the other two are not
commended;—the four beginning with the *Āsura* are lawful for the
Kṣatriya,—these same four, excepting Rākṣasa, for the Vaiśya and the
Śūdra;—thus Rākṣasa is lawful for the Kṣatriya only; so that for the
Brāhmaṇa there are only six, for the Kṣatriya all the eight;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 231), which also adds that only the first
six. are lawful for the Brāhmaṇa, the latter four for the Kṣatriya, and
for the Vaiśya, and the Śūdra also, all these with the exception of the
Rākṣasa.

**(verses 3.23-24)  
**

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.10-14).—‘Of these, four are commended for the
Brāhmaṇa, of these the preceding being more commendable than the
succeeding; and of the remaining four, the succeeding is more
reprehensible than the preceding; of these again, the sixth and the
seventh are in keeping with the character of the *Kṣatriya*,—and the
fifth and the eighth for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra; because Vaiśyas and
Śūdras have no restrictions regarding their wives.’

*Śaṅkha* (4.3).—‘Among these the four mentioned first are lawful; the
Gāndharva and the Rākṣasa are commended for the Kṣatriya.’

*Gautama* (4.14, 15).—‘The first four are lawful; six, according to
some.’

*Viṣṇu* (24.27, 28).—‘Among these, the first four are lawful; the
Gāndharva also, for Kṣatriyas.’

*Āpastamba* (2. 12. 3).—‘Of these, the first three are commended, the
preceding being more commendable than the succeeding.’

*Mahābhārata* (Ādi-parva, 73, 12).—‘The Gāndharva and the Rākṣasa are
lawful for the Kṣatriya.’

*Mahābhārata* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 859).—‘O Yudhiṣṭhira, for the
good Brāhmaṇas, the Brāhma form is the lawful one.’

*Nārada* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 859).—‘The first four are commended
for the Brāhmaṇa; the Gāndharva and the Rāksasa for the Kṣatriya, the
Āsura for the Vaiśya, and the Śūdra; the last one has been condemned.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 860).—‘The first four forms of
marriage are lawful, and conducive to water-libations; being free from
fees and fit for Brāhmaṇas, they save both families.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 487).—‘The first four are commended
for the Brāhmaṇa; the Gāndharva and the Rākṣasa for the Kṣatriya, the
Āsura for the Vaiśya and for the Śūdra; the eighth one is entirely
condemned.’

*Saṃvarta* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 487).—‘If a good girl be unobtainable by
any means, than she may be married even by theft, while she may be
alone.’

*Arthaśāstra* (Part 11, p. 13).—‘Of these the first four are righteous,
as authorised by the Father; the remaining (which are unrighteous) may
be authorised by the Father and the Mother (who accept the fees).’

The further recommendation of the ‘*Brāhma*’ and other three forms for
the Brāhmaṇa, means that the ‘*Āsura*’ and the ‘*Gāndharva*’ are
prohibited for him.

Similarly, for the *Kṣatriya*, it is the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ alone, not the
‘*Āsura*’ and the ‘*Gāndharva*.’

For the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*, it is the ‘*Āsura*’ alone.

Among those that have been sanctioned (before) and prohibited now, there
is to be option; so that one may have recourse to the optional forms
only when those that have been sanctioned absolutely in all cases are
not possible. If a man were to have recourse to those forms of marriage
that have been sanctioned in one place and interdicted in another,
without considering the possibility or otherwise of those that are
absolutely sanctioned,—he would be committing a wrong, and his offspring
would be defective;—this is what the law-giver has indicated under verse
23 above by the phrase, ‘the good and bad effects upon the offspring.’
But such an act would not nullify the marriage itself in the way in
which the fact of the bride being the bridegroom’s ‘*sapiṇḍa*’
does.—(24)

‘For the Vaiśyas and Śūdras are not particular about their wives’
(Baudhāyana, 1.20.14). *Cf*. the following passages for the different
rules in this respect. Vaśiṣṭha 1.27-28 gives six equivalents to these
eight; so Āpastamba (2.12.3), who admits three as good. Baudhāyana
1.20.10 gives eight and permits but four; so Viṣṇu (24.27). Gautama
gives the eight, admits four, and says some admit six. “The Mahābhārata
(1.73.8 ff.) ascribes descending virtue to each ‘according to Manu’, and
mixing up the sense of verse 23 and verse 27, allows four for a Brāhmaṇa
and six for a Kṣatriya.”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 487), as selecting
out of the eight, those that are specially commended;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 858), which adds that of the form specially commended for
the Brāhmaṇa, two are still more important

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 159), adds the following note:—The Brāhma, Daiva,
Ārṣa and Prājāpatya forms have been declared to be commended for the
Brāhmaṇa; for the Kṣatriya, the Rākṣasa alone has been commended; and
for the Vaiśya and Śūdra, the Āsura only. For the Brāhmaṇa the first
four, ending with the Prājāpatya are the primary forms, and the Rākṣasa
must be a secondary substitute for him, because it is lawful for the
next lower caste, Kṣatriya. For the *Kṣatriya*, the Rākṣasa, is the
primary form; and as according to the preceding verse, the Āsura,
Gāndharva, Rākṣasa and Paiśāca are commended for him, the three, besides
the Rākṣasa, must be regarded as secondary substitutes. According to
others, however, the phrase ‘last four’ (of verse 23) stands for the
four beginning with ‘Prājāpatya and according to this, the Rākṣasa being
directly mentioned in the present verse as specially commended for the
Kṣatriya, the secondary substitutes for him would be the Prājāpatya, the
Gāndharva and the Āsura. For the Vaiśya and the Śūdra, the Āsura is the
primary, and the Gāndharva and the Paiśāca,—or the Gāndharva and the
Prājāpatya—secondary substitutes.

*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 140) quotes this verse and explains that even
though this text mentions among the ‘commended’ forms, the Āsura, where
the bride’s father receives wealth from the bridegroom, yet it must be
understood to sanction the payment of only so much of wealth as may be
required for the decking of the bride.—It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dana,
p. 683);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 100), which adds that for the
Kṣatriya, the *Rākṣasa* is the principal form, and for the Vaiśya and
the Śūdra, the *Āsura*.

*Aparārka* (p. 91) quotes this verse and adds that for the Brāhmaṇa, the
Brāhma, Daiva, Ārṣa and Prājāpatya are commended; the Āsura and
Gāndharva are neither commended nor forbidden;—for the Kṣatriya, the
Rākṣasa alone is commended; the Āsura and the Gāndharva are neither
commended nor forbidden;—for the Vaiśya and Śūdra, the Āsura alone is
commended; the Gāndharva is neither commended nor forbidden;—the Paiśāca
is forbidden for all castes.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, pp. 190 and 231), which adds
that though the first four are ‘commended,’ it does not mean that the
next two are forbidden; all that is meant is that these two are *not
commended*.

The law laid down in this verse pertains to the *Kṣatriya* and the rest,
not to the Brāhmaṇa; for if it referred to the latter, there would be an
inconsistency regarding the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ forms; as the Brāhmaṇa can never
do the ‘killing and wounding’ (which are inevitable in that form), which
acts are possible only for the *Kṣatriya* and others.

‘*Of the five*’— Forms of marriage, beginning with the
‘*Prājāpatya*’—three are lawful, and two—*i.e*., the *Paiśāca* and the
*Āsura*—should never be adopted.

Though the ‘*Prājāpatya*’ has not been mentioned in connection with the
*Kṣatriya* and others, yet it is here specially enjoined for them; so
also the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ for the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*. It is the *Āsura*
and the *Paiśāca* that are interdicted.

The conclusion on this point is as follows:—For the Brāhmaṇa there are
six forms of marriage; of these the ‘*Brāhma*’ is the best of all;
inferior to that are the ‘*Daiva*’ and the ‘*Prājāpatya*;’ inferior to
these is the *Ārṣa*, then the ‘*Gāndharva*,’ then the ‘*Āsura*.’

There are some people who regard this verse as pertaining to the
Brāhmaṇa also. According to these, the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form is permissible
for that Brāhmaṇa who may have adopted the profession of the *Kṣatriya*.
They argue that, even though the Brāhmaṇa may have abandoned his own
functions and taken to those of other castes, if they do some ‘killing
and wounding’ in connection with marriage, he may become liable to the
performance of expiatory rites for doing those acts; but that would not
deprive the ‘Rākṣasa marriage’ of the character of ‘marriage.’

That the ‘*Brāhma*’ is the best form of marriage has been shown by its
results (described in versus 37, *et seq*.). As for the other three,
though they have not been interdicted under any circumstances, yet their
inferiority is deduced from the fact that the results following from
them are of an inferior type. As regards the ‘*Āsura*’ form, since it
has been specifically prescribed for the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*, it
implies the exclusion of the *Brāhmaṇa* and the *Kṣatriya* from it. And
yet we have the distinct injunction of six forms as permitted for the
Brāhmaṇa (in 23 above). From all which it follows that there is option;
but it is an option with the restriction that one is to have recourse to
the second option only in the event of the first option being
impossible. Fur-ther, that an option is intended, is clearly established
by the fact that several forms of marriage are permitted, and yet a
combination of all is impossible; just as, in the case of *Vrīhi* and
*Yava*, we admit an option, because both are sanctioned, and yet they
cannot be combined. Thus, then, when other forms are possible, if one
were to adopt the ‘*Āsura*’ form, its results, in regard to spiritual
merit and the character of the offspring, would be inferior.

As regards the *Kṣatriya*, the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form is the best; as it had
been enjoined absolutely without any option by all the four verses.
Verse 23 permits four forms for the *Kṣatriya*, which means that the
‘*Āsura*,’ the ‘*Gāndharva*,’ and the ‘*Paiśāca*’ also are permitted;
while those latter have been interdicted by the assertion that the
Rākṣasa alone is for the ‘*Kṣatriya*,’ (24). Hence it follows that these
latter forms are *optional*, not primary. In consideration of the
context, it is clear that the injunction is for the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form
only. But, since there is no definite exclusion of the ‘*Prājāpatya*’
form, this latter also is equal to the ‘*Rākṣasa*,’ for the *Kṣatriya*.

Similarly, for the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra* also, the ‘*Prājāpatya*,’
which has been mentioned as permitted in all cases, is not prohibited.
The ‘*Āsura*’ and the ‘*Paiśāca*’ are both ‘permitted’ and ‘prohibited’
for them; the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ also has been interdicted by the phrase,
‘*excepting the Rākṣasa*’ (23), while it is permitted by the assertion
that ‘three are lawful’ (25).

It is for the *Brāhmaṇa* only that the ‘*Paiśāca*’ is not permitted, and
for the *Kṣatriya* and the rest, the ‘*Brāhma*,’ the ‘*Daiva*’ and the
‘*Ārṣa*’ are not permitted at all.—(25)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 860) in support of
the view that certain forms of marriage are permissible for the,
Brāhmaṇa under abnormal circumstances; and adds the following
explanation:—From among the five—Prājāpatya, Āsura, Gāndharva, Rākṣasa
and Paiśāca,—the Āsura having been singled out as fit for the Vaiśya and
the Śūdra only, and the Paiśāca being deprecated for all, the remaining
three alone are lawful for the Brāhmaṇa; *i*. *e*., the Prājāpatya, the
Gāndharva and the Rākṣasa. This conclusion is based on the analogy of
the livelihood recommended for the next lower caste being permissible
for the higher caste in abnormal times; so that the marriages commended
for the Kṣatriya are permitted for the Brāhmaṇa under abnormal
circumstances.

The same work on page 859 quotes the second half of the verse, to the
effect that the Paiśāca is not lawful for any caste.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 159) quotes it, and offers the following
explanation:—From among the five—Prājāpatya, Āsura, Gāndharva, Rākṣasa
and Paiśāca,—three are ‘lawful *viz*, Prājāpatya, Gāndharva and Rākṣasa.
The second half indicates two of these—*i.e*., the Āsura and Paiśāca—as
unlawful.—Even though the Prājāpatya has been enumerated in verse 24
among the primary forms recommended for the Brāhmaṇa, yet, the same is
here mentioned only as ‘lawful under abnormal circumstances,’ with a
view to indicate that it is inferior to the Ārṣa.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 487) quotes this verse and adds the
following explanation—From among the forms beginning with the Brāhma and
ending with the Āsura, three—*i*. *e*., the Brāhma, the Daiva and the
Prājāpatya are lawful; while Ārṣa and the Āsura are unlawful, on account
of their involving the *purchase* of a wife; as between these two also,
one should never adopt the Āsura, which should be avoided as carefully
as the Paiśāca, It goes on to add that here Manu has set forth only a
view that has been held by ‘some one’; according to his own view, there
is no ‘purchase’ involved in the Ārṣa marriage, where the ‘pair of cows’
given are not by way of a ‘price’ for the girl; as has been clearly
declared in verse 53 below. So that, according to Manu, the Ārṣa is as
lawful as the other three.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 683);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p.
479), which adds the following explanation:—Among the five, beginning
with the *Brāhma* and ending with the *Āsura*, the first three are
‘righteous,’ as not involving any form of selling;—the *Ārṣa* and the
*Āsura* are ‘unrighteous,’ as involving *bartering*, and lienee, like
the Paiśāca, they should not be adopted even in abnormal circumstances.

‘*Singly*’—this is a inert re-iteration, each single form having been
already prescribed in the foregoing verses. The ‘mixed’ form is what is
prescribed here; where the ‘*Gāndharva-Rākṣasa*’ are prescribed
independently of (apart from) the other forms. The notion derived from
what has gone before being that each form stands apart by itself, just
like the *Vrīhi* being used apart from the *Yava*,—the present verse
lays down the combination (of two). When we have two such texts as
‘offer the *Vrīhi*’ and ‘offer the *Yava?* each of which prescribes a
substance to be used at a sacrifice independently of the other,—we
conclude that the two are meant to be optional alternatives, and they
are not meant to be mixed tip; because, if the mixture of both were
used, we would be obeying neither the injunction of *Yava*, nor that of
*Vrīhi*. Similarly, in the present case, when only one girl is to be
married, it being impossible to adopt any two forms of marriage, the
present text proceeds to prescribe the combination of two of them.

Such a combination of the said two forms would be possible under the
following circumstances:—A girl living in her father’s house, happens to
see a boy living in the same house and having heard praises from
messengers, falls in love with him, but not being mistress of herself
she cannot meet him,—and then she enters into a compact with her lover,
requests him to take her away by some means or other, and gets herself
carried away: and the bridegroom, being possessed of great strength,
carries her away after having ‘killed and wounded’ (her guardians): Now
in this case, since there is ‘voluntary union between the two’ (verse
32), it fulfils the conditions of the ‘*Gāndharva*’ form: while, since
he has carried her away, after ‘having killed and wounded’ (verse 33),
the conditions of the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form also become fulfilled.

These two forms are possible for the *Kṣatriya* only. *These two are
lawful for the Kṣatriya*—says the Text.

*Mentioned before*—is a mere reiterative reference.

Others have offered the following explanation:—When a *Kṣatriya* marries
several girls, he marries one by the ‘*Gāndharva*’ form, and another by
the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form:—and this is the ‘*mixed form*’ meant by the text.
And when all are married by one or the other of these two forms, it is a
case of ‘*separately*’ mentioned by the text. And from this we gather
that it is only these two forms of marriage that the *Kṣatriya* might
adopt promiscuously—sometimes the one and sometimes the other; while in
the case of the ‘*Prājāpatya*’ and the rest, he should adopt the same
form in all his marriages which he happens to adopt in the first.—(26)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 860), where the
following notes are added:—This lays down the forms.permissible for the
Kṣatriya under abnormal circumstances.—‘*Pṛthak*’ means *unmixed*, and
‘*Miśra*,’ *mixed*; we have the latter form in a case where the marriage
having been previously settled by mutual understanding between the bride
and the bridegroom, if the bride’s people oppose it, the bridegroom
takes her away by force, as happened in the case of Kṛṣṇa’s marriage
with Rukmiṇī (described in the *Bhāgavata*). A further distinction has
got to be made here: the ‘mixed’ form is permissible only under abnormal
conditions, while the ‘unmixed’ one is a secondary form permissible for
all time; and hence the mention of this latter in the present verse is
merely reiterative (as remarked by Medhātithi also),—the reiteration
being made for the purpose of indicating the utter inferiority of the
‘mixed’ to the ‘unmixed’ form. This implies that for other castes also,
in the event of an ‘unmixed’ form being not possible, the ‘mixed’ form
becomes permissible.—Even though the Paiśāca has been prohibited for
all, yet it has been mentioned among the forms of marriage only for the
purpose of its being permitted for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra under
exceptionally abnormal circumstances.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 160) also quotes this verse as laying down what is
permissible for the Kṣatriya under abnormal conditions. īt adds the
following notes:—‘*Pṛthak pṛthak*’ means the primary and the secondary
forms, laid down as alternatives; and the second half quotes an example
of the ‘mixed’ form; there is a ‘mixture’ of the Gāndharva and Rākṣasa
forms when after a mutual understanding has been arrived at between the
bride and the bridegroom, if the bride’s people raise objections to the
marriage, the bridegroom fights with them and takes away the bride by
force.—This is to be understood only as an illustration; on the same
analogy, other ‘mixtures’ may be permissible for other castes also.—Even
though very much deprecated, the Paiśāca form is permitted under
abnormal circumstances for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra,—as also for such
twice-born persons as have adopted the living of the Vaiśya or the
Śūdra.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 682).

The author now describes the exact nature of the several forms of
marriage.

‘*After having dressed*.’—What is meant is a particular form of
dressing, ordinary dressing being absolutely necessary (and hence
implying no special regard). Hence the. meaning is—‘After having dressed
with nice and suitable clothes, such as might be available at the
place.’

‘*Having worshipped*;’—*i.e*., having done worship with bracelets,
armlets and other ornaments, and also special modes of honouring,
indicative of great affection.

There is nothing to indicate the connection of the ‘dressing’ and
‘worshipping’ with either the bride only or with the bridegroom only:
hence they should be taken as relating to both.

‘*Endowed with learning and character*.’—This implies also the other
qualifications of the bridegroom, mentioned in other law-books; such as
‘intelligent, loved by the people, having his virility carefully tested’
(Yājñavalkya, *Ācītra*, 55).

‘*Himself*;’—*i.e*., not previously requested by him.

‘*Invites*’ him;—*i.e*., gets the bridegroom to come, by sending bis own
man.

This giving away of the daughter is the ‘*Brahma form*’ of marriage.
Though the term ‘form’ is a general one, yet, in consideration of the
context, it has to be taken as standing for *marriage*.

The upshot of this definition comes to be that ‘when a man obtains a
wife without asking for it, and with due honour, it is the *Brahma* form
of *marriage*.’

“The definition provided in the text cannot be right; as, in reality,
‘marriage’ is for the purpose of accepting a wife \[so that the mere
‘giving’ by the father cannot be *marriage*.\]”

The ‘giving’ spoken of in the text is meant to extend right up to the
end of the marriage-ceremony; in fact, until the marriage has been
performed, the ‘giving’ is not complete; it is at the time of ‘marriage’
that there is ‘acceptance’ of the girl by the bridegroom; and until this
*acceptance*, the ‘gift’ is not complete. Specially, ‘giving’ here does
not consist merely in the renouncing of one’s proprietary right; it
extends up to the creating of the proprietary right of another person
(the recipient). It is in view of this that the author is going to
declare later on—‘the learned should regard the seventh step as the
final stage of the marriage’ (5.152). Thus, then, it is at the time of
marriage that the maiden should be given away; it is for this reason
that the author of the *Gṛhyasūtra* has laid down the rites in
connection with the *Brāhma* marriage as to be performed at the time of
the marriage itself.

As for the ‘giving’ before the marriage, this is merely a verbal
compact; and if no such compact has been entered into, it is just
possible that at the desired time the marriage may not be actually
performed; for in the absence of formal agreement, the father of the
bride may not give her, or the bridegroom may not accept her. Hence it
is necessary that before the actual marriage, a regular contract should
be entered into, in some such form, ‘she is to be given by you and
accepted by me.’ \[Just as an internal sacrifice becomes naturally
excluded when it is deficient in some essential factor and does not
fulfil the conditions of the injunction.?\]

Some people argue as follows:—“When the cow and such other things are
given away for the purpose of obtaining a transcendental result, the
*giving* is accomplished merely by the recepient accepting it with the
proper texts and the same should be the case with all acts of *giving*.
So that, in the case in question also, marrying occupying the same
position as *accepting*, ‘marriage’ should be regarded as synonymous
with *acceptance*; and the act of *accepting* consists in *making the
thing one*’a *own*; as says the revered Pāṇini in Sūtra 1. 3. 56—‘The
root *yama* with the prefix *upa* in the sense of *making one’s own*
takes the Ātmanepada.’ From this it is clear that marriage is done only
for the purpose of *receiving the maiden*.”

This, however, is not right. In fact, the ‘marriage’ is of the maiden
that has been *accepted*, and it is for the purpose of making her a
*wife*. The Injunction bearing upon marriage is not in the form
that—‘one should *accept* the maiden by means of this rite;’ nor are the
sacred texts recited at marriage such as signify the act of *accepting*;
as is the case with such *mantras* as—‘*devasya tvā pratigṛhṇāmi, etc*.’

As for what has been said regarding the sense of *making one’s own*,
such a sense is not incompatible with our view. The act of ‘marrying’
also is of the nature of *making one’s own*. The act of ‘giving’ only
brings about the ownership of the recipient; and the act of ‘marrying’
creates a particular form of ownership. Further, the wife is not a
‘property’ in the same sense that the cow and other things are; the
latter are property’ in the sense that they may be used in any way one
likes, while the maiden married by one can be used only as ‘wife so that
the relation between husband and wife is of that of a peculiar kind of
ownership; as will be shown later on, under 5. 152.—(27).

‘*Arcayitvā*’—Medhātithi and Kullūka take this as well as ‘*ācchādya*’
as referring to both the bride and the bridegroom;—Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghvānanda refer ‘*urcayitvā*’ to the bridegroom only.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 847), where the
following explanatory notes are added:—‘*Ācchādya*,’ ‘having dressed,’
with clothes;—‘*arcayitvā*’ ‘having worshipped’ with garlands,
sandal-paint and so forth;—both these are to be done to the bridegroom,
not to the bride; since both these are related to ‘*āhūya*’ ‘having
invited,’ which cannot refer to the bride;—‘*Svayam*,’ ‘himself,’ should
not be taken (as Medhātithi and Kullūka take it) as precluding the
possiblity of the request for the girl coming from the bridegroom; as
such preclusion would be inconsistent with the rule laying down the
‘selection’ of the bride by the bridegroom.—Further Baudhāyana
says—“After ascertaining his *Śrutaśīle*, learning and character, one
gives the girl to the Student *who seeks for her*,”—and here we find it
distinctly laid down that there should be *a seeking for the girl* by
the bridegroom;—in this passage ‘Student,’ *Brahmacāri*, stands for one
whose observance of studentship has not suffered in any way.—‘The
seeing’ spoken of by Baudhāyana consists in selecting the bride. That
the father should ‘himself’ invite the bridegroom has been laid down as
the peculiar characteristic of the ‘Brāhma’ form of marriage. Such also
is the custom among the people of the south.

This verse is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 106) in connection
with a somewhat subtle discussion. The author holds the view that
‘marriage,’ ‘*vivāha*,’ is the *act of taking a wife*, and hence the
‘giving’ of the bride cannot be called ‘marriage,’ as the *giving* is
done by the Father, while the *taking of a wife* is done by the
Bridegroom. On this ground, he argues, the definition of the Brāhma form
of *marriage* provided in the present text of Manu should not be
explained as consisting in the ‘*giving* of the girl’; the word
‘*Dānam*’ has, therefore, to be explained differently, in its
etymological sense ‘*yasmai dīyate tat dānam*’ *i.e*., ‘*dānam*’ means
‘that for the sake of accomplishing which the *giving* is done’;—and as
it is the Student’s ‘taking of a wife’ that is accomplished by *giving*,
it is this ‘taking of the wife’ which should be taken as expressed by
the word ‘*dānam*.’ He argues further that if the ‘marriage consisted in
the *giving* of the girl, then the agent, *person* marrying, would be
the bride’s Father, and not the Bridegroom. The author is conscious of
the syntactical difficulty involved in his explanation, in connection
with the participle ‘*āhūya*’, ‘having invited,’ which, as it stands,
must have the same nominative agent as the ‘giving.’ But he brushes it
off with the remark that the derivation of the verbal root in ‘*āhūya*’
being only a secondary factor, may be ignored, or we may supply some
such word as ‘*sthitaḥ*’;—the meaning thus being—‘the man who takes the
wife when he comes *after being invited*.’

It is interesting to note that the question raised by Raghunandana in
*Smṛtitattva* has been anticipated and satisfactorily explained by
Medhātithi (see *Translation*, p. 58).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 88);—in *Dānakriyākaumudī* (p. 9)
as laying down the necessity of *clothing* the girl properly;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 61a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 227), which explains ‘*arcayitvā*’ as ‘having worshipped him with
offerings of ornaments and other tilings.’

discussing him, directing him to jointly carry on Dharma, this is the
Brāhma form of marriage.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 848).—‘When one gives to a
man of his own caste, who is well known to him, the girl who has not

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 848).—‘One should give away the
girl adorned with gold, before she has reached puberty.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 848).—‘To a qualified

‘*Being performed*;’—*i.e*., when a sacrifice, such as the Jyotiṣṭoma
and the like, has been commenced; if one gives away his daughter to the
‘*priest*’—the Adhvaryu—‘*who is officiating*’—working—‘*at it*;’—‘after
having *decked her*;’—this is a mere re-iteration; this forming an
essential condition in every form of giving one’s girl in marriage; that
‘one should give the girl in marriage after having decked her’ being a
general injunction.

“The cow, the house, the mule and other things have been mentioned as
the fee for priests, the giving of the daughter has not been found laid
down anywhere as helping in the fulfilment of sacrificial performances.”

What has ‘helping in the fulfilment of sacrificial performances’ got to
do with the subject under consideration? All that is meant is that, when
a sacrifice has begun to be performed, if one gives his daughter to the
priest, this constitutes the ‘*Daiva*’ form of marriage.

In this case, there is some slight return made by the bridegroom in the
form of services rendered in connection with the sacrifice. Even though
the daughter is not given in consideration of any sacrificial services
rendered, yet when she is given to him while he is engaged in a certain
act, it does give rise to the inference (that she has been given as a
reward for those services). And it is in view of this fact that the
‘*Daiva*’ form has been regarded as inferior to the ‘*Brāhma*’ form (in
which latter, there is not the slightest suspicion of any kind of
return).—(28).

Hopkins is not quite right when he says that ‘the priest receives the
maiden as part of the fee.’ It is not so, as has been made clear by
Medhātithi. Further the ‘fee’ is always given *after the completion* of
the rite, and not only when ‘*it has begun*’, or while the priest is
still ‘*doing his work*.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 849), where the
explanation is added—*Samyak sauṣṭhavena karma kurvate ṛtvije
ityanvayaḥ*; the construction is that the girl is given ‘to the priest
who is doing the work efficiently, in a proper manner’;—in *Hemādri*
(Dāna, p. 684);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 228.).

two*,’—‘*after taking*’—receiving—‘*from the bridegroom*, ’—*when the
maiden is given away*’—this is the ‘*Ārṣa*’ form.

‘*In obedience to law*;’—*i.e*., with the idea that such receiving is
sanctioned by law, and hot with the idea of receiving it in exchange for
(price for) the girl. The sense is that what is received cannot be
regarded as the *price*; as there is no possibility of any higher or
lower demand being made (as there would be if it were a question of
*price*).—(29)

Burnell is not right in remarking that ‘this is the most common form
now.’ Among the better classes of the Brāhmaṇas the ‘Brāhma’ still
continues to be the most common form; and among others, the form most
common now is the Āsura.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 849), where
‘*dharmataḥ*’ is explained as meaning ‘according to family-custom’; or
‘in obedience to the law governing the Ārṣa marriage, not by way of a
*price* for the girl.’

It is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 155) as showing that it is not
necessary that the number of ‘cows given should be always ‘two’ as
mentioned in other *Smṛtis*;—it adds that if the Father of the Bride
accept this ‘pair of cow and bull’ it becomes a ‘selling’ of the
girl;—in *Hemādri* (Dana, p. 684);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
62a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 228), which explains
‘*Gomithunam*’ as ‘a milch cow and a bull.’

The ‘*Prājāpatya*’ form of marriage is that in which the girl is given
away on the clear undertaking having been taken in so many words that
“you both together shall duly Fulfil your duties.”

‘*Duty*’ has been mentioned only by way of illustration; the undertaking
refers to ‘*duty*,’ ‘*property*’ and ‘*pleasure*’ also; as, in all these
three, the interests of the husband and the wife are common. In reality,
what is actually uttered is the word duty’ only, the expression used
being ‘may duty be performed by you both,’ and not that ‘may duty,
property and pleasure he accomplished:’ but, in consideration of what
has been said in other law-books, the term ‘*duty*’ in the said
expression has been explained as standing for ‘property’ and ‘pleasure’
also. Hence the conclusion is that the expression ‘may duty be performed
by you both together is to be pronounced at the time that the girl is
being given away to the person upon whom the condition has been imposed
that ‘this girl is to be given to you only if you fulfil your duty,
property and pleasure along with her,’ and who has accepted the
condition at the time of marriage. Thus, then, even though⁽property’ and
‘pleasure’ also are meant to be included, yet they are not actually
mentioned, because they are not of sufficient importance. Says Gautama
(4. 7)—‘In the Prājāpatya form of marriage, the mantra used is *may you
together perform your duty*;’ and the use of the term ‘*mantras*’
clearly shows that the words to be used should be precisely as they are
laid down here, Just as in the case of *mantra-texts*. Further, in the
case of very powerful men, it would not be right to make it a condition
that the wife shall partake of all their properties and pleasures; and
yet that these also are meant we learn from other law-books.

This form of marriage is inferior to the preceding ones only by reason
of this condition being imposed; as this shows that there is a desire on
the part of the giver for some sort of return from the recipient.

The bridegroom also is made to repeat in his words the condition that he
accepts; and the exact form laid down is not for the giver only. For
‘having made to repeat’ would have been enough if only one of them were
to say it, the phrase, ‘*with the words*,’ would have been superfluous;
the act of *repeating* being always by means of words only. Says the
author of the *Gṛhyasūtra*—‘Having said *this is true for you*, he
should make the bridegroom say *this is true for us*.’ In fact, the
prefix in ‘*anubhāṣya*’ (‘having made to repeat’) clearly indicates the
*confirmation* of what has been said before.—(30).

‘*Kinsmen*.’—the father and other relations of the bride.

‘*As* *well as to the bride*;’—*i.e*., by way of ‘dowry.’

The compound ‘*Kanyāpradāna*’ is to be expounded as ‘*Kanyāyāḥ
āpradānam*’—the meaning being ‘the carrying away of the maiden.’ This
constitutes the ‘*Āsura*’ form of marriage.

*Of his own will*;—*i.e*., in any manner he may chose; not according to
rules laid down in the scriptures. This is what distinguishes this from
the ‘*Ārṣa*’ form. In the latter, the scripture restricts the gift to ‘a
cow and a bull’ only; while in the present case, the ‘*wish*’ of the
giver shall depend upon the beauty, the character and such other
qualities of the bride.—(31).

explains ‘*Āpradānam*’ as *ādānam grahaṇamiti yāvat*, *i.e*.,
‘taking’;—and ‘*Svācchandyāt*’ as ‘of his own free will, not in

willingness or otherwise of the gill, thus differing from the

The ‘*union*’—coming together at one place—‘*of the bride and
bridegroom, through love*’—through mutual longing.

In deprecation of this form of marriage it is added—‘*It has sexual
intercourse for its end*’—it serves the purpose of sexual intercourse
only. This is made clearer by the next clause—‘*it has its source* *in
lust*;’—‘*source*’ is that from which a thing springs; and it is from
lust that this union springs.—(32).

Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa raise the question as to the prescribed
offerings and wedding ceremonies being performed in the cage of the
Gāndharva, Rākṣasa and Paiśāca forms of marriage; and on the strength of
a text of Devala’s and another of Śaunaka (*Bahvṛca Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa*)
they declare that the offerings must be made, but that no Vaidika
mantras should be recited; this latter reservation being based on Manu’s
text (8.226). Medhātithi discusses this at great length under verse 34
below, from which it appears that the opinion on this subject has always
been divided. In support of the view that the subsequent rites are
essential, several texts are quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, pp.
861-862).

This verse is quoted in ‘*Vīramitrodaya*’ (Saṃskāra, p. 855), where the
‘*Anyonyasaṃyogaḥ*’ is explained as ‘mutual agreement’,—‘*Maithunyaḥ*,’
‘conducive to all acts accomplished by means of sexual intercourse’,—and
‘*Kāmasambhavaḥ*,’ as ‘originating from excessive lust’;—in *Hemādri*
(Dāna, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 229), which
explains ‘*Maithunyaḥ*’ as ‘favourable to sexual intercourse.’

‘*Forcibly*;’—*i.e*., having subdued the guardians of the girl, if one
carries her away by force, this is called the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form. This is
all that is meant to be stated here. ‘*Having beaten*,’ etc., is a mere
descriptive re-iteration; for it is always understood that, while the
bridegroom is forcibly taking away the girl, if some one seeks to stop
him, he shall beat them and do the rest of it. But if, knowing the great
strength of the abductor, her guardians, through fear, let her go,—then
also it is a Rākṣasa form of marriage; and it is not a necessary
condition of this form that the *beating*, *etc*., must be done.

‘*Having beaten*’—by means of sticks, etc.

‘*Wounded*’— cutting limbs by strokes of the sword and other weapons.

‘*Pierced*’—walls and forts.

‘*Crying out and weeping*;’—*i.e*., unwilling girl. This is what
distinguishes this from the ‘*Gāndharva*’ form. ‘*Crying out*’ stands
for such loud wailings as—‘there is none to protect me, I am being taken
away, save me,’ and so forth: while ‘*weeping*’ stands for shedding
tears, which is the characteristic of all frightened women.—(33)

This verse is quoted in ‘*Vīramitrodaya*’ (Saṃskāra, p. 856), where the
following explanation is given—‘*Hatvā*’—‘having beaten, those
obstructing him’;—‘*Chittvā*’—having cut off, the heads of the
obstructors’;—‘*Bhittvā*’—‘having pierced, with strokes of
weapons’;—‘*Krośantīm*’—calling for her relations;—all this indicates
fighting.

The second half is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 129) in support of
the view that what distinguishes the *Rākṣasa* form is *forcible
abduction*.

The verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra,:p. 229), which explains ‘*prosahya*’ as ‘by force’.

The unwillingness of the girl is the condition common to the ‘*Rākṣasa*’
and the ‘*Paiśāca*’ forms: the difference is that in the former there is
*beating*, while in the latter there is *stealth*.

‘*Asleep*’—overpowered by sleep.

‘*Intoxicated*’—senseless, under the influence of wine, &c.

‘*Unconscious*’—who has lost consciousness on account of the disorders
of the wind-humour.

‘*By stealth*’—not openly.

‘*Approaches*’— has sexual intercourse with.

This is the Paiśāca marriage, of all marriages the ‘*wickedest*’—the
most sinful. That is to say, the issue of such a marriage does not
become the *rightful* child.

------------------------

In connection with this subject, some people think that the
‘*Gāndharva*’ form of marriage is accomplished by mere ‘intercourse,’
the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ by mere ‘abduction’ and the ‘*Paiśāca*’ by mere
‘approach,’—irrespective of the sacramental rites relating to the
‘taking of the hand’ and the rest. And they base this idea upon the fact
that all these three are mentioned in apposition to ‘marriage’ which
forms the subject-matter of the context.

But, according to these people, in the ‘*Brāhma*’ and other forms also,
since the ‘giving’ is mentioned in apposition to ‘marriage,’ the
sacramental rites would cease (to be necessary factors in the marriage).
But we have shown above, how. these rites cannot be omitted. The fact of
the matter is that it is only figuratively that the term ‘marriage’ has
been applied to that act of ‘*giving*’ which is done for the purpose of
‘marriage.’

As regards the ‘*Gandharva*’ form, the revered Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana has
described it, in connection with the union of Duṣyanta and Śukuntalā, as
being ‘without fire and without sacred texts;’ and this shows that there
are certain sacramental rites of ‘taking the hand,’ etc., but they are
done without sacred texts etc.

As regards the ‘*Paiśāca*’ form, there is a difference of opinion:—In
this form (it is argued) ‘approaching’ is the prime factor; but that
does not deprive the girl of her ‘maidenhood;’ as this can be put an end
to only by the sacramental rites attendant upon marriage; so that the
girl still continuing to be a ‘maiden,’ the prohibition of rites in
connection with ‘non-maidens’—which we find in the statement that ‘the
sacred texts relating to marriage are restricted to *maidens only*’ (8.
226)—does not apply to this form of marriage; and hence its connection
with the sacramental rites remains undisturbed. The prohibition just
referred to is for the purpose of precluding the sacramental rites (from
the case of non-maidens); while the girl married by the ‘*Paiśāca*’ form
has her maidenhood destroyed only when she has gone through the rites.
Thus, then, even though the ‘approaching’ may take place first, yet the
taint of ‘non-maiden-hood’ does not apply to her. It is only in
accordance with this view that Karṇa can be called ‘maiden-born;’ for if
mere intercourse with man were to deprive the girl of her maidenhood,
how could we have such a statement as ‘the son born of a maiden is
called *maiden-born*.’ If, on the other hand, the name ‘maiden’ be
applied only to such girls as have not had the sacramental rites
performed for them, then the said statement would be all right, Karṇa
and others of his kind, being sons of *unmarried* girls. It is only if
‘approaching’ be the prime factor that it is possible for a child being
born from a ‘maiden.’ In fact, we find in stories the description of the
‘marriage’ of girls who had been previously ‘approached’ by the
‘Paiśāca’ form.

It might be asked—“when sexual intercourse has been already accomplished
with the help of intoxicants, etc., what would be the use of the
sacramental rites?”

The answer to this is as follows:—Though the act of copulation has been
accomplished, and the man. has transgressed the prohibition of
intercourse with a ‘maiden,’ yet the performance of the rites is
necessary,—firstly, for the purpose of making her entitled to share in
the religious acts of her husband, and, secondly, for the purpose of
avoiding the sin of repeating the act of having intercourse with a
‘maiden.’ This form of marriage is thus deprecated by reason of its
involving a transgression of the prohibition of having intercourse with
a maiden, and also because it subserves the purely physical purposes of
the man (and not any religious purpose).

The above view, however, is not right; because, in ordinary parlance,
the term ‘maiden’ denotes the girl who has had no intercourse with man,
and not one for whom the sacramental rites have not been performed. In
fact, even though her sacramental rites have not been perforated; if a
girl happens to have sexual intercourse with man,-she ceases to be
regarded as a ‘maiden;’ and when such girls have taken to the profession
of prostitutes, intercourse with them does not involve the sin of having
intercourse with a ‘maiden.’ It is true that the words ‘virgin’ and
‘maiden’ have beeu regarded as referring to a female in the earlier
years of her age; but, in connection with rules relating to marriage,
they are always used in the sense of one who has had ho intercourse with
man. It is for this reason that when a man is found to be seeking
marriage with a girl who maintains the appearance of a virgin, and does
not openly go in for sexual intercourse,—he is warned by people with
such words as—‘she is no longer a virgin, her virginhood has been
destroyed.’

Further, in the case of marrying such a girl, there would be a serious
deficiency in the sacramental rites themselves. *E.g*., the rite of
‘conception’ has to be done with sacred texts, such as
‘*Viṣṇuryoniṅkalpayatu, etc*. (Ṛgveda, 10.184. 1),—which means ‘May
Viṣṇu generate upon your generative organ;’ and there can be no
‘generation’ (by Viṣṇu) of what has already been generated’ (by another
man); so that the use of the sacred text in this case would be
meaningless. Nor could, any such text be used when an unmarried girl
would be ‘approached’ in the ‘*Paiśāca*’ form; as it has been definitely
declared that it is to be used only in the case of ‘married’ girls. Nor
would it be right to hold that the ‘generation’ (spoken of in the said
text) refers to the case of marriages other than the ‘*Paiśāca*;’ for
the use of the text has been prescribed without any restriction at all.

The above and several other difficulties crop up if ‘approaching’ is
regarded as the principal factor. The term ‘*Upagamana*,’ ‘approach,’
then, should be taken as standing for the acts of embracing, kissing and
such other concomitants of actual ‘intercourse;’—such use of the term
being due to the fact that the said acts are concomitants of, and lead
up to, the act of ‘intercourse.’ As regards the expression, ‘the
maiden-born son,’ inasmuch as the direct meaning of the term ‘maiden’ is
not applicable, it is taken in its indirect meaning of ‘one who has not
gone through the sacramental rites.’ As for the case where the
sacramental rites are performed even after ‘intercourse,’ such cases are
very rare. Then, as regards the statement—‘when the sacrament is
performed for a pregnant girl, with or without the knowledge of her
being so, etc.’ (9. 173),—this refers to cases where the person
performing the sacramental rites is not the same that has had the
previous intercourse with her; so that this would not be a case of
‘*Paiśāca*’ marriage at all; as in this latter, the girl is given in
marriage to that same person who has had intercourse with her (during
sleep, etc.), and that same person would be performing the rites for
her. Then again, so far as the performance of rites for the pregnant
girl is concerned, it has been directly laid down by scriptural texts.
All this we shall explain in full detail under Discourse IX.

Others, again, have held the view that—“in reality, the *intercourse*
itself is the principal factor; for, if it were not so, there would be
no point in the prohibiting of *intercourse* (with maidens).”

But if ‘intercourse’ were the principal factor, then that itself would
constitute ‘marriage;’ none other being possible, according to the
reasoning just put forward; so that there would be no object for the
prohibition, as ‘intercourse,’ when *voluntary*, would constitute the
*‘Gāndharva*’ marriage; when ‘*forcible*,’ it would be ‘*Rākṣasa*’
marriage; and in other cases it would be ‘*Paiśāca*;’ and no other
‘intercourse,’ without rites is possible, whereby the prohibition could
apply to all forms of ‘intercourse.’ As a matter of fact, however, there
certainly is an object for the prohibition,—in the shape of such cases
where there is forcible intercourse by stealth, or where the girl is
given away by her parents, but no sacramental rites are performed. This
latter cannot come under the ‘*Gāndharva*’ marriage; as it is not
‘voluntary’ on the part of the girl. It is for this reason that in such
a case the husband does not incur the sin of having intercourse with a
‘maiden;’ as this latter contingency happens under totally different
circumstances.

Thus, then, since the performance of sacramental rites has been
interdicted in the case of girls who have already had sexual
intercourse,—and since the ‘*Paiśāca*’ also is, like the ‘Brāhma’ and
the rest, a means (of acquiring a wife),—and since, therefore, this form
also is capable of being culled ‘marriage,’—it follows that what is
denoted by the term ‘*approach*,’ ‘*upagama*’ (‘intercourse’) is only a
secondary factor.

The differentiating characteristics of the eight forms of marriage are
as follows (1) that marriage which comes without asking, just like
landed property, gold and the rest, is ‘*Brāhma*;’ (2) that which comes
by virtue of one’s priestly character is ‘*Daiva*;’ (3) that which is
accompanied by the present of a cow and a bull is ‘*Ārṣa*;’ (4) that
which is accompanied by the condition, ‘may you together perform your
duties,’ and which comes either by or without asking, is ‘*Prājāpatya*;’
the characteristics of the others are easily discerned.

In the words, ‘*Brāhma*,’ etc., the nominal affix denotes *relation*;
and the relationship of Brahma and the rest is ascribed to the marriage,
with a view to eulogising it. So also in the rest. In the case of the
term ‘*Paiśāca*,’ the meaning is ‘that which is fit for Piśācas,’ and it
connotes deprecation.—(34).
