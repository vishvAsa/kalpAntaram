She who is not a “sapiṇḍa” of one’s mother, not of the same “Gotra” as his Father, and who is not born of (unlawful) intercourse—has been recommended for marriage.—(5)


“Three kinds of sapiṇḍā have got to be excluded—


To the first category belongs the girl who is one’s own sapiṇḍā as being the sapiṇḍā of his father, who is the married husband of his mother;—to the second category belongs the girl who is not the sapiṇḍā of that ‘father’ who is only the supporter (not the progenitor), and is one’s own and his natural father’s (progenitor’s) sapiṇḍā,—and who thus is his own sapiṇḍā, but not that of his supporter-‘father’;—and to the third class belongs that girl who is the sapiṇḍā of the supporter-‘father’, but not one’s own sapiṇḍā. All this diversity is based upon the fact that in the case of the ‘adopted’ son (in whose case the supporter-father and the progenitor-father are different), the son’s body (piṇḍa) does not contain the constituent elements of the body of the father.


For the same reasons there are four kinds of ‘father’ also—


Of these the ‘progenitor’, husband of the mother, and the ‘seed-owner’ both transmit the constituents of their body to the child; and on that ground the sāpiṇḍya ‘consanguinity’; of these two Fathers to the Aurasa and Kṣetraja sons would be direct; while that of the ‘field-owner’ (the second kind of ‘father’) would be only indirect, through the field (i.e., the body of his wife); the bodies of the husband and wife having been declared to bo one.—Now the girls that fall within these three kinds of ‘consanguinity would become excluded by the test that ‘one should marry a girl younger than himself, who is not his sapiṇḍā’ (Yājñavalkya 1. 52). But the Sapiṇḍā of the Supporter (adoptive) father would not be the Sapiṇḍā of the adopted son, and as such she would not he excluded by the said text. Hence it becomes necessary to find out a text excluding the ‘father’s Sapiṇḍā;’ and such a text is found in Manu 3. 5 (the present verse). This text clearly implies that the girl who falls within seven degrees of the ‘Sāpiṇḍya’ of the Secondary Father (not the progenitor) is to be avoided; in this sense the term pituḥ, being taken in its etymological sense of one who supports, pāti iti pitā, includes the adoptive, father also.”

The text proceeds to show what sort of maiden should be married.

‘*She who is not a sapiṇḍa of one’s mother*, *and who is not of the same
gotra as his Father, has been recommended for marriage*.’ The term
‘*sapiṇḍa*’ indicates the relations on the mother’s side. According to
another Smṛti, women are called the “mother’s sapiṇḍa” only up to three
steps of relationship. But, as a matter of fact, marriage with relatives
on the mother’s side is permitted beyond not the *third*, but the
*fifth*, step of relationship. Says Gautama (4—3 and 5)—‘Beyond the
seventh step of relationship on the Father’s side and beyond the fifth
step on the mother’s side.’ Thus, inasmuch as the term ‘*sapiṇḍa*’
cannot be taken here in its literal sense (of relation within *three*
steps of relationship), it has to be explained, in accordance with other
*Smṛtis* (such as Gautama), as standing for ‘mother’s relation.’ The
meaning thus comes to be—‘She who is not born of the mother’s family;’
and the limit of *relationship* is to be taken as prescribed by Gautama.
So that one should not marry the girl who is descended either from his
maternal grandfather or great-grandfather, up to five steps downwards,
on account of the closeness of relationship among the descendants of
these. Hence the mother’s sister, the daughter of the mother’s sister,
as also those descended from the maternal great-grandmother, all these
become excluded, on the ground of all of them being ‘relations.’

‘*She who is not of the same gotra as his Father*—The term ‘*gotra*’ has
been declared to stand for the descendants of

Vaśiṣṭha, Bhṛgu, Garga and the rest.—‘*Of the same gotra*’ means
*belonging to same gotra*. That is, a ‘Vaśiṣṭha’ girl cannot be married
by a ‘Vaśiṣṭha’ boy; nor the ‘Garga’ girl by a ‘Garga’ boy.

In the *Vaśiṣṭha* (Dharmaśāstra), there is prohibition also of the girl
belonging to the same *gotra* as one’s mother. It says—‘If the
twice-born person marries a girl of the same *gotra* or the same
*Pravara* as himself, he shall renounce her and perform the penance of
the Cāndrāyaṇa; so also if he has married the daughter of his maternal
uncle, or a girl of the same *gotra* as his mother.’

Gautama says—‘There is marriage between parties not having the same
*Pravara*’ (4.2); so that if the *Pravara* is different, there may be
marriage, even though the *gotra* happen to be the same.

This, however, is not right; because another Smṛti (Yājñavalkya) has
prohibited both—‘one should marry a girl born of a *different gotra and
Ṛṣi*’ (Acāra, 53),—where ‘*Ṛṣi*’ stands for ‘pravara.’

“But how can a girl be born of the same *Ṛṣis* when her *gotra* is
different?”

Why may this not be possible when the *Smṛti* distinctly speaks of it?
This subject is one that falls entirely within the purview of *Śruti and
Smṛti*, and is beyond our perception; so that there could be no
incongruity (in what is directly asserted in the *Smṛti*).

“What are ‘*pravaras*,’ after all?”

Well, you are asking too little; you might as well ask—‘What is a
Brāhmaṇa?’ ‘What is a gotra?’ In fact, just as the generic character of
‘man’ being equally present in all men, the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ and the rest
constitute the particular species included under that generic
character,—exactly in the same manner, the generic character of
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ being common among a number of men, ‘*Vaśiṣṭha*’ and the
rest come in as specific sub-divisions; and related to each ‘*gotra*’
there are a few names of ‘*Ṛṣis*;’ and the person who belongs to a
certain ‘*gotra*’ has to connect himself with these Ṛṣi-names, which are
called his ‘*pravara*.’ This same is the meaning of the term ‘*pravara*’
in connection with the prohibition of marriage.

The writers of Sūtras have mentioned the *pravaras* along with each
distinct *gotra*, in such words as—‘such and such are the *pravaras* of
the person belonging to such and such a *gotra*.’ As for the distinct
*gotras*, these are duly remembered by the persons born in those
*gotras* themselves—‘we belong to the ‘*Parāśara-gotra*,’ ‘we belong to
the *Upamanyu-gotra*,’ and so forth. Though, like.their *gotra*, people
remember their *pravaras* also, yet inasmuch as the number of *pravaras*
is large, it was thought that people might forget them, and hence the
Smṛtis were written for the purpose of mentioning the *pravaras*
connected with each of the *gotras*. As for the *gotra*, save that
people themselves remember it, there is no other indicative in the form
that ‘he who is like this and that belongs to such and such a *gotra*.
All that has been declared in connection with *gotra* is that persons
belonging to the same *gotra* must belong to a common stock and a common
caste.

This diversity of *Gotra* and *Pravara* is found only among Brāhmaṇas,
not Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas. Say the authors of the *Kalpasūtra*—‘that of
the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya is determined by that of their priests.’ On
the ground of this Kalpasūtra-statement occurring in the section dealing
with *Pravara*, it might be construed to be a denial of *pravara* only,
which might be understood to apply to those two castes also by reason of
particular *gotras* having been mentioned in relation to them. But, in
reality, there are no *gotras* mentioned in connection with them.

“Under the circumstances, what sort of restriction would there be on the
point of relationship, in connection with marriages?”

Our answer is as follows:—The rule of Gautama (4. 3), that ‘it should be
beyond the seventh step among the relations on the father’s side,’ is
common to all castes (and this would supply the necessary limitation).

In the present verse also the term ‘*not of the same gotra*’ means ‘who
is not a *Sapiṇḍa*;’ and, just as the term ‘*sapiṇda*,’ in the preceding
phrase, so the same term here also, would be taken as standing for
‘relations;’ and in this way we secure the exclusion of girls descended
from the father’s sister, as also of other girls descended from one’s
great-grandfather, up to the seventh step. And it is only persons up to
the seventh step of relationship that have been called ‘*sapiṇḍa*.’

Others have explained ‘*gotra*’ to mean *family*. And in this case,
there is no need for any limit; there can be no marriage among parties
who know each other as ‘belonging to the same family.’ In accordance
with this view also the term ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ has to be construed twice
over; so that, as before, the daughter of the father’s sister and Others
become excluded.

“But, according to this view, the exclusion of girls belonging to the
same *gotra* and having the same *pravaras* becomes difficult. As among
these there is no such idea as that ‘we belong to the same family.’”

The answer to the above is that this difficulty is sought to be
explained by a reference to tradition. There is a tradition that
‘Vaśiṣṭha and others like him are the prime progenitors of families, and
persons descended from them and belonging to their *gotra* are the
*Pravaras*, who were their sons and grandsons endowed with excellent
austerities and learning and vastly famous.’ \[ And in this sense
‘persons belonging to the same *gotra* and having the same *pravaras*’
may be regarded as ‘belonging to the same family.’\] In other *Smṛtis*
also we find the same rule.

The following facts, however, have to be borne in mind in this
connection:—In the phrase, ‘having the same *pravaras*,’ the *sameness*
is in regard to the *names*, not the mere *number*, of *Pravaras*; and
the question arises, whether the prohibition applies to all cases where
al the Pravara-names are the same, or only to those where even one name,
happens to be common. If the whole set of names constitutes the
‘*pravara*,’ then there is no ‘sameness of Pravara’ in a case where a
few names are common but others are different, and hence the ‘set of
names’ in the two cases becomes different; so that the prohibition would
not apply to such a case; and marriage could take place between the
*Upamanyus* and the *Parāśaras*, whose *gotras* are different,—one
belonging to the *Gotra* of Upamanyu, and the other to the *gotra* of
Parāśara,—but there is difference in their. ‘*pravaras*,’ in the Sense
noted above; because for the ‘*Upamanyu gotra*’ the *Pravaras* are
‘Vaśiṣṭha, Bharadvāja and Ekapāt,’ while for the ‘*Parāśara gotra*’ they
are ‘Vaśiṣṭhya, Gārgya and Parāśarya.’ If, on the other hand, only one
name constituted the ‘Pravara’—and not the whole set, then the
prohibition would apply to even such cases where a single name happens
to be common. *E.g*., when it is said ‘*Māṣa* grains should not be
eaten,’ one ceases to eat even mixed *Māṣa* grains.

What, then, is the right view?

The right view is that single names constitute ‘*pravara*; it is in
accordance with this that we find such usage as ‘*ekam vṛṇīte*,’ ‘*dvau
vṛnīte*,’ ‘*trīn vṛnīte*,’—where there is co-ordination between ‘one,’
‘two’ and ‘three’ with the ‘*Pravara*;’ and it is said that ‘there
should be no marriage even when, one pravara-name is common.’

The mention of the ‘twice-born person’ is merely indicative; as for the
*Śūdra also* there is no marriage up to seven grades of relationship on
the father’s aide, and five on the mother’s side.

‘*Marriage*’—*i.e*., taking to wife.

‘*Recommended*’—enjoined with commendation.

‘*Who is not born of (unlawful) intercourse*,’ *i.e*., who is born
directly from her lawful father. ‘*Niyoga*’ (begetting of offspring by
the widow) having been permitted, the girl who would be born under that
form would not be excluded by the foregoing qualifications; hence she is
separately excluded by the term ‘*who its not born of unlawful
intercourse*;’ which means that one should not voluntarily marry a girl
born, of ‘Niyoga,’ because she is born of unlawful intercourse.

Others read ‘*Amaithune*’ (for ‘*Amaithunī*), and explain it to mean
that the girl described has been recommended as an associate at
religions functions, and *not for sexual intercourse*.

And such a prohibition would be by way of eulogy; the sense being—‘if
one marries a girl with these qualifications, she fulfills his religious
functions, even though there be no sexual intercourse.’

‘*Asapiṇḍā ca yā mātuḥ—asagotrā ca yā pituḥ*’—Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda hold the first ‘*ca*’ to mean that the ‘sagotrā’ of the
mother also is excluded; this exclusion is supported by Vaśiṣṭha as
quoted by Medhātithi;—according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the second ‘*ca*’ connects the ‘*asapiṇḍā*’
with ‘*pituḥ*’ also. But there appears to be no point in this as the
father’s ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ would be already included under the father’s
‘*asagotrā*’. Medhātithi appears to have been conscious of this, as he
adds that the term ‘*sapiṇḍa*’ here stands for ‘relations’ \[see
*Trans*. p. 26, ll. 3-4, which should be as follows, and not as it
appears there—“*In the present phrase* ‘*asagotrā ca pituḥ*’, *the
particle* ‘*ca*’ *excludes the fathers sapiṇḍā also*.”\]

‘*Amaithunī*’—This is the reading adopted by Medhātithi, to whom Buhler
wrongly attributes the reading ‘*maithune*’ (‘for conjugal union’),
which is the reading of Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa and Kullūka, the last
however explaining it to mean ‘(she is recommended) for the Firelaying,
child-begetting and other acts to be performed by the husband and wife
jointly.’—Medhātithi notes a third reading ‘*amaithune*’, and explains
it to mean that ‘the girl is recommended as an associate at religious
functions, and *not for sexual intercourse*, though he does not consider
this satisfactory.—Medhātithi’s reading ‘*amathunī*’ has been explained
by him to mean ‘not born of unlawful intercourse’, and added for the
purpose of excluding the girl horn of *Niyoga*. Though Nandana also
adopts this same reading, he explains it as one ‘who has had no sexual
intercourse.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 81) in support of the view that
the girl to be married should be one who is ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ on both the
paternal and the maternal sides; it adds that ‘*asagotrā*’ alone would
preclude the *father’s* ‘sagotrā’ also (the gotra of the man being the
same as his father’s); the word ‘*pituḥ*’ has therefore been added with
a view to the ‘*putrikāputra*’.—Such a girl is ‘recommended’—for
‘*dārakarma*’—such rites as cannot be performed without a wife and for
‘*maithune*’, *i.e*., such rites as can he done only conjointly by the
pair, *e.g*. the *Pākayajña*, and the like,—‘*asapiṇḍā ca yā mātuḥ*’ is
meant to preclude the marrying of the daughter of the maternal uncle,
she being the man’s ‘mother’s *sapiṇḍā*’.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 468), where the
following explanation is added—‘who is *asapiṇḍā* of the mother, as also
her *asagotrā*—who is *asagotrā* of the father, and also his
*asapiṇḍā*,—is recommended for all acts to be performed by the
couple’.—It raises the question that the separate mention of the
‘mother’ is superfluous; as the wife has no ‘*piṇḍa*’ or ‘*gotra*’ apart
from the husband; so that the ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ and ‘*asagotrā*’ of the
‘mother’ would be the same as those of the ‘father’;—and supplies the
answer that in the case of the *Gāndharva* and some other forms of
marriage, the bride being not given away by her father, she retains her
*gotra* and *piṇḍa*; so that her ‘*sapinda*’ and ‘*asagotra*’ would not
be the same as those of her husband.

In connection with this verse a peculiar point of view has been set
forth by ‘some people’ in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 691):—

&gt; “Three kinds of *sapiṇḍā* have got to be excluded—
&gt;
&gt; 1.  who is one’s own and his father’s *sapiṇḍā*,
&gt; 2.  who is one’s own *sapiṇḍā*, but not the *sapiṇḍā* of his father,
&gt; 3.  who is not one’s own *sapiṇḍā*, but is the father’s *sapiṇḍā*.
&gt;
&gt; To the first category belongs the girl who is one’s own *sapiṇḍā* as
&gt; being the *sapiṇḍā* of his father, who is the married husband of his
&gt; mother;—to the second category belongs the girl who is not the
&gt; *sapiṇḍā* of that ‘father’ who is only the *supporter* (not the
&gt; *progenitor*), and is one’s own and his natural father’s
&gt; (progenitor’s) *sapiṇḍā*,—and who thus is his own *sapiṇḍā*, but *not*
&gt; that of his supporter-‘father’;—and to the third class belongs that
&gt; girl who is the *sapiṇḍā* of the supporter-‘father’, but not one’s own
&gt; *sapiṇḍā*. All this diversity is based upon the fact that in the case
&gt; of the ‘adopted’ son (in whose case the supporter-father and the
&gt; progenitor-father are different), the son’s body (*piṇḍa*) does not
&gt; contain the constituent elements of the body of the father.
&gt;
&gt; For the same reasons there are four kinds of ‘father’ also—
&gt;
&gt; 1.  the progenitor, the husband of the mother;
&gt; 2.  the owner of the ‘field, *i.e*. the mother’s husband, who is not
&gt;     the progenitor;
&gt; 3.  the owner of the ‘seed’, *i. e*. the progenitor, who is not the
&gt;     husband of the mother;
&gt; 4.  and the supporter, *i.e*. the adoptive father.
&gt;
&gt; Of these the ‘progenitor’, husband of the mother, and the ‘seed-owner’
&gt; both transmit the constituents of their body to the child; and on that
&gt; ground the *sāpiṇḍya* ‘consanguinity’; of these two Fathers to the
&gt; *Aurasa* and *Kṣetraja* sons would be direct; while that of the
&gt; ‘field-owner’ (the second kind of ‘father’) would be only indirect,
&gt; through the *field* (*i.e*., the body of his wife); the bodies of the
&gt; husband and wife having been declared to bo *one*.—Now the girls that
&gt; fall within these three kinds of ‘consanguinity would become excluded
&gt; by the test that ‘one should marry a girl younger than himself, who is
&gt; not his *sapiṇḍā*’ (Yājñavalkya 1. 52). But the *Sapiṇḍā* of the
&gt; Supporter (adoptive) father would not be the *Sapiṇḍā* of the adopted
&gt; son, and as such she would not he excluded by the said text. Hence it
&gt; becomes necessary to find out a text excluding the ‘father’s
&gt; *Sapiṇḍā*;’ and such a text is found in Manu 3. 5 (the present verse).
&gt; This text clearly implies that the girl who falls within seven degrees
&gt; of the ‘*Sāpiṇḍya*’ of the *Secondary Father* (not the progenitor) is
&gt; to be avoided; in this sense the term *pituḥ*, being taken in its
&gt; etymological sense of one *who supports*, *pāti iti pitā*, includes
&gt; the *adoptive*, father also.”

This view is not accepted by the author of *Vīramitrodaya* himself, who
takes Manu’s text to mean the exclusion of the girl who is one’s
*Sapiṇḍā* or *Sagotrā* either through his father or through his mother.

*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 106) quotes this verse, explaining *daṛa-karma* as
‘the act of making a wife’ *i.e*., *the, taking of a wife*.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1. 53, p. 34)
in the sense that the *sagotrā* girl is to be excluded.

*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 690) quotes this verse and adds that the second
‘*ca*’ excludes the father’s ‘*Sapiṇḍā*’ also. Here also we have a
reproduction of the discussion found in *Parāśaramādhava* (see above).

The verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 133), which adds the
following explanatory notes:—The meaning of this is as follows—The girl
who is *not-sapiṇḍā* of the mother,—and also her *not-sagotrā*, which is
implied by the first ‘*ca*’—is recommended, *i.e*., is fit for being
married. The purport of all this is as follows—Twice-born men are
entitled to marry girls belonging to the same caste as themselves, as
also those belonging to lower castes; the marriage with a girl of the
same caste is the principal or primary form of it, while that with a
girl of a different caste is only secondary;—for the married man two
kinds of acts have been enjoined—sacrifices and intercourse; and in the
text the former set of acts is spoken of by the term ‘*dāra-karma*’, and
the latter set by the term ‘*maithuna*’

Having explained the verse, *Madanapārijāta* also raises the question
why the *Sapiṇḍā* and *Sagotrā* of the *Mother* should be mentioned
apart from that of the *Father*, and deals with it in a somewhat
different manner from that in *Parāśaramādhava* or *Vidhānapārijāta*.
Its answer is that the separate mention is meant to meet the following
case—Devadatta has for Ids mother the *adopted* daughter (of his
grandfather), who has been ‘appointed’ by her adoptive ‘father’;—hence
Devadatta does not inherit the *gotra* of his Progenitor-father;—now the
husband of the aforesaid adopted daughter (*i. e*. the progenitor of
Devadatta) has adopted a daughter, who is the *Sapiṇḍā* of her adoptive
father (Devadatta’s Progenitor), but not the *Sapiṇḍā* of
Devadatta;—thus Devadatta might marry the adopted daughter of his
progenitor. This contingency has been prevented by the separate
exclusion of the ‘Mother’s *Sapiṇḍā*; as the girl, though not the
*Sapiṇḍā* of Devadatta or his adoptive Father, would still be the
*Sapiṇḍā* of his mother, whose *piṇḍa* is one with that of her husband,
(the adoptive father of the girl concerned).

Another question raised is why should the mother’s *asapiṇḍā*, who is
included in the mother’s *asagotrā* implied by the *eha* in the text, be
mentioned separately?—The ‘mother’s *Sapiṇḍā*’ has got to be so
mentioned for the purpose of excluding the girl born in the family of
the father of one’s step-mother, who is one’s own ‘*asapiṇḍā*’, as also
the ‘*asagotrā*’ of the mother, but is the ‘*sapiṇḍā*’ of the mother; so
that if the text had excluded only the ‘mother’s *asagotrā*,’ the said
girl would he marriageable; she becomes excluded, however, by the
condition that she should *not* he his *Another’s sapiṇḍā*’.

It goes on to raise a. further question that the phrase ‘*asagotrā ca
pituḥ*’ need not be taken to include the father’s ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ also, as
the latter is already included under the term ‘father’s *asagotrā*’.—The
answer to this is that the separate exclusion of the ‘father’s
*sapiṇḍā*’ is necessary in view of the following case:—Devadatta’s
father, Yajñadatta, is the adopted son of his father, Bhānudatta,—a girl
is born in the family of Yajñadatta’s *progenitor-father*,—this girl
would be *asagotrā* of Devadatta’s ‘father’ (adoptive), and also
‘*asagotrā*’ of his ‘mother’:—thus there would be a likelihood of
Devadatta marrying this girl;—and this becomes precluded by taking the
‘ca’ to mean the ‘*father’s asapiṇḍā*’. If this had not been intended by
Manu, he would have said ‘*one’s own asagotrā*’ (‘*asagotrā ca
yātmanaḥ*’). Thus the upshot of all this is that the girl to be married
should be ‘*asapiṇḍā* and *asagotrā*’ of his Mother, and also
‘*asapiṇḍā* and *asagotrā* of his Father’.

This verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 196);—in
*Gotra-pravara-nibandha-kadamba* (p. 131), which adds the following
notes:—In as much as the text forbids only the ‘*sapiṇḍā*’ of the
mother, it follows that the *sagotrā* of the mother is not forbidden;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 184), which adds the following
explanation:—The girl who is not ‘*sapiṇḍā*’ either of the bridegroom or
of his mother, and who is not the ‘*sagotrā*’ of the bridegroom or his
father, is commended for the purpose of marriage;—in *OodādharUpaddhati*
(Kālasāra, p. 223), which adds the following notes—‘*Dārakarmaṇi*’, in
the rite that makes a ‘wife’,—‘*maithune*’, in the act of intercourse
*which is consummated conjointly by man and woman*;—the sense is that
the said girl is commended not only for cooking and such other acts as
are done by the woman alone, but also in that joint act which is done by
both conjointly; according to *Kalpataru*, ‘*maithune*’ means ‘in the
begetting of the lawful son by means of sexual intercourse’.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 477), in support of
the view that not only the girl, but her family also should be carefully
examined;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 588);—in *Aparārka* (p.
84);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 508);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 204).

*Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtra* (1.5.1).—‘First of all, one should examine the
family—on the father’s as also on the mother’s side, etc., etc.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.54).—‘\[The girl should be selected\] from a Śrotriya
family of which ten generations are well known, which is expansive and
which is not beset with the defect of an infectious disease.’

*Laghu-Śātātapa* (36).—‘One shall not marry a girl whose father is not
known.’

*Viṣṇu* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 587).—‘In connection with the
marriage of Brāhmaṇas, what should be heeded is the family.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 588).—‘The following are the fourteen
families in which one should not marry: (1) One should avoid such
Brāhmaṇa-families as have their *Pravaras* unknown, and also (2) the
family of hereditary (professional) priests; (3) a family of which the
members are too tall; (4) that of which the members are too short; (5)
that of which the members are of too pronounced a complexion; (6) the
family of which several members have a limb wanting; (7) that of which
several members have too many limbs; (8) that of which the members
suffer from dyspepsia; (9) that of which the members suffer from
leucoderma, or (10) leprosy and such other diseases; (11) that of which
the members are too lascivious; (12) that of which the members are given
up entirely to Tāntric practices; (13) the Family of which the members
suffer from epilepsy or (14) from paleness.’

*Hārīta* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 589)—‘\[Such objectionable families
are to be avoided, because\] the offspring is of the same nature as the
family.’

*Hārīta* (Aparārka, p. 84).—‘The following families are to be avoided
even though they he not outcasts: In which there, has been lucoderma, or
leprosy, or dropsy or pthisis or other infectious deseases, in which
members have been shortlived or suffering from piles; of which the
*Gotra* and *Pravara Ṛṣiṣ* are not known, or that, in which the Veda is
unknown or one which has the same *Ṛṣis*. The first six are to ho
avoided because the offspring takes after the family; of the unknown
*Gotra-Pravara* is to he avoided because such a family would he unlit
for sacrificial performances; and one in which the Veda is unknown is to
be avoided, because it would he unfit, for divine rites; one having the
same *Ṛṣis* as the man himself is to he avoided because it is the same
family. For these reasons one should examine seven generations on the
father’s side and live on the mother’s side and then select as his wife
a girl who has not attained puberty, is endowed with superior qualities
and has a brother. He shall always select one who is fully qualified as

‘*That in which the sacred rites*’—the natal and other sacraments—‘*have

also the compulsory ‘Five Sacrifices,’ etc., are not performed.

‘*Male-less*’—productive of females; *i.e*., in which, aṣa rule, only
female, not male, children are born;

‘*Devoid of the Veda*’—destitute of Vedic study.

‘*Romaśārśasam*’—This copulative compound mentions two kinds of
families. ‘*Romasha,’ ‘woolly*,’—*i.e*. the members of which have their
arms and limbs covered with much and long hair. ‘*Piles*’—fleshy
protuberances in the anus, which being a disease, are extremely painful.

‘*Phthisis*’—the disease of consumption.

‘*Dyspepsia*’—slow-digestion: by which the food eaten is not properly
digested.

‘*Epilepsy*’—leading to loss of memory and other cognate troubles.

‘*Leucoderma*’—white spots on the body, with holes.

‘*Leprosy*’—is well-known.

All these words—beginning with ‘*romasha*’—are names of particular
diseases, and are to be taken as ending in possessive affixes.

Older commentators have explained that the prohibition. herein contained
is based entirely upon ordinary visible considerations: As a matter of
fact, bipeds inherit the peculiarities of their mother’s families;
hence, children born of mothers belonging to families that have
‘abandoned the sacred rites,’ etc., etc, would be prone to the same
defects;

and diseases ace apt to be infectious; works on medicine having declared
that ‘all diseases, with the sole exception of’ Diarrhoea, are
infectious.’—(7)

The prohibition in the preceding verse was with regard to the family of
the bride; while that in the present verse pertains to her body.

The girl whose hairs are of either tawny or golden colour is called
‘*kapilā*.’

‘*With superfluous limbs*’—*e.g*., having six fingers.

‘*Who has disease*’—who is suffering from many diseases, or is overtaken
by some incurable disease;—the possessive affix having the sense of
*many* or Of *permanence*.

‘*Who has no hair*’—‘*loman*’— standing for *hairs* in general also.
What the present qualification has in view, however, is the entire
absence of hair in the arm-pits and between the thighs.

‘*Garrulous*’—who talks much and disagreeably, when it is necessary to
speak very little.

‘*With reddish eyes*’—Whose eyes are red, on account of some
disease.—(8)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 731) in support of
the view that one should not many a girl with defects;—it explains
‘*vācāṭā*’ as ‘garrulous’ and ‘*piṅgalā*’ as ‘with reddish eyes.’

*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 149) quotes it and adds that the defects here
described do not deprive the girl, if married, of the character of the
‘lawful wife,’ as visible (physical) defects can mean only physical
disabilties, and cannot affect the nonphysical spiritual or moral
character of anything.

The verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 120), where
‘*rogiṇī*’ is explained as ‘suffering from epilepsy and such diseases,’
and ‘*vācāṭām*’ ‘as one who talks much of improper things,’—and not
simply as ‘garrulous’, which is the explanation of the same author in
another place \[Saṃskāra-prakāśa, p. 731, see first note above\];—also
in *Aparārka* (p. 78) to the effect that one should not many a girl who
is not endowed with the proper marks;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 74);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 510), which explains ‘*kapilām*’, as ‘of the
colour of red lice,’ and ‘*piṅgalā*’ as ‘of the colour of fire:’—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 200), which explains ‘*vācāṭā*’ as
‘garrulous,’ and *piṅgalā*’ as ‘with tawny eyes;’—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 50a).

‘*Asterism*’ is constellation; one who bears the name of one of these;
such as ‘*Ārdrā*,’ ‘*Jyeṣṭhā*,’ and the like.

‘*Bearing the name of a tree*’—such as ‘Śiṃśapā,’ ‘*Āmalakī*,’ and so

‘*River*’—the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā; she who bears these names.

The term “*ṛkṣavṛkṣanadī*” is to be expounded as a copulative compound;
which with the following term ‘*nāman*’ forms a genitive *Tatpuruṣa*
compound; and these, along with the term ‘nāman’ repeated, form a
*Bahuvrīhi* compound; the repeated term ‘*nāman*’ being dropped.

‘*Having her name after a low caste*’— such as ‘*Barbarī*’

‘*Śabarī*’ and the like.

‘*Mountains*’— such as the Vindhyā, the Himalaya, and the rest.

This compound (‘*parvatanāmikām*’) also is to be expounded as the
former; and has the ‘*ka*’ affix added to it.

‘*Named after a bird*’— snch as ‘*Śukī*’ ‘*Sārikā*,’ and the like.

‘*Serpent*,’ snake; one who is named after it; such as ‘*Vyālī*,’
‘*Bhujaṅgī*.’

One whose body is free from defects is called ‘*avyaṅgāṅgī*;’ the term
‘*avyaṇga*’ standing for *freedom from defects*; just like such other
words as ‘*pravīṇa*,’ ‘*udāra*,’ and the rest. Since the term
‘*avyaṅga*,’ etymologically, means ‘free from defects in the limbs,’ the
second ‘*aṇga*’ must be taken as standing for the *whole body*; hence
the epithet ‘*avyatiya*’ denotes *fulness or comeliness of the bodily
form*.

‘*Saumya*,’ ‘agreeable’—it has been laid down in this book that the
names of women should be sweet-sounding and easy to pronounce.

She who moves like the swan or the elephant. That is, one whose gait is
as elegant and languid as that of the swan or the elephant.

The term ‘*tanu*,’ ‘*fine*,’ here does not stand for ‘*small*;’ it means
moderate. Just as the girl who is neither fat nor leau is called
‘*tanvaṅgī*,’ ‘one with a fine body.’

‘*Mṛdvaṇgī* is one whose limbs are *tender*, not hard or rough.

Such a female ‘*one should marry*.’ ‘*Female*’ here must be taken to
stand for the *maiden*, as it is the maiden that is being spoken of in
the context.

“If that is so (if this verse also refers to the *maiden*), then the
prohibition contained in verse 8 regarding ‘one who has no hair, &c.,’
is superfluous; as the positive injunction, contained in the present
verse, implies that ‘one who is not as here described should not be
married.’”

True, that is so; the same fact when stated by means of two
verses—affirmatively in one and negatively in the other—becomes clearly
understood.

In the present context, the term ‘maiden’ is used in the sense of a
woman who has not experienced sexual intercourse. Says Vaśiṣṭha—‘One
should acquire a wife who has had no sexual intercourse and who is
similar to himself.’ But one who has been ‘consecrated’ (by marriage) by
one man is no longer capable of being ‘consecrated’ by another; as there
can be no doing of what has been already done. So that, if a girl has
been married, and her husband goes away before she has had intercourse
with him,—if she happens to be a loose woman, she cannot be married to
another person, even though she is still a ‘*maiden*’ (in the technical
sense); and it is such a maiden that is mentioned in the words of
Vaśiṣṭha quoted above. In another work also it is said—‘One should marry
a female, never before married by another person, who is younger than
himself and has brothers’ (Yājñavalkya, *Ācāra* 52).—(10)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 731) as setting
forth the external signs of a marriageable girl;—also in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Lakṣaṇa, p. 118) to the same effect;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 132)
as setting forth the external signs; and for the *internal* signs it
refers to Āśvalāyana who has prescribed the following method;—eight
balls should be made of clay brought from eight different places, and
after some incantations have been uttered over them, the girl should be
asked to pick up one of them; (1) if she picks up that made of clay from
fields with rich corn growing, it is a sign that she would have progeny
rich in grains; (2) if she picks up that of clay brought from the
cattle-shed, she will be rich in cattle; (3) if that of clay from the
altar, she will be an expounder of Brahman;—(4) if that of clay from a
lake that is never dry, she will be endowed with all riches; (5) if that
from the gambling den, she will be crafty;—(6) if that from the
road-crossing, she will be inclined to wander about; (7) if that from
barren soil, she will be unlucky; (8) and if that from the crematoriuûi,
she will destroy her husband.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 78);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 74)
as laying down the external signs of a marriageable girl;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 509) which explains ‘*tanulomakeśadaśanā*’ as
‘one the hair on whose chest is scanty, and whose hair and teeth are
fine’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 200);—and in *Nṛsiṃha-prasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 50a).

‘*Putrikādharmaśaṅkayā*’—‘For fear of her having the character of the
Appointed Daughter’ (Medhātithi);—‘For fear (in the former case) of her
being an Appointed Daughter, and (in the latter) of committing a sin’
(Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda, and ‘others’ in Medhātithi).
Govindarāja adopts Medhātithi’s explanation so far as this phrase is
concerned; but he gives a somewhat different explanation of the first
half of the verse, which according to him, would mean ‘one should not
marry a girl who has no brother, *or* whose father is not known’,—the
two contingencies being independent; while according to Medhātithi, the
second clause (‘whose father is not known’) is subordinate to the
former,—the meaning being that the doubt regarding the girl being an
‘appointed daughter’ would arise if there were no brother, *and* if the
father were not known; for he adds “if the father is known, there is no
fear of the girl being an Appointed Daughter, as he will himself declare
whether or not she has been ‘appointed’.”

According to Medhātithi, therefore, in the translation of the verse, we
should have ‘and’ instead of ‘*or*’.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 474), which adds
the following notes:—He shall not many a girl with regard to whom it is
not known whether or not her father has the intention of making her an
‘appointed daughter;’—the sense is that where there is no fear of this,
one may marry the girl, even though she has no brother. The clause ‘*na
vijñāyeta vā pitā*’ (which, according to this explanation, means ‘*the
intentions* of whose father are not known’) implies that it is possible
for the daughter to be ‘appointed’ even without the Father making an
agreement to that effect with the bridegroom;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
82), which adds that this implies that the daughter can be ‘appointed,’
even without express agreement and declaration.

The verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 746), where it
is explained as meaning that ‘one should not marry a girl with regard to
whose father it is not known whether or not he has the intention of
making her an Appointed Daughter’; and it adds that it is shown by this
that according to all the sages a daughter can become ‘appointed’ even
without being openly declared to be so;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p.
414), which explains the meaning to be that one should not marry the
girl with regard to whom it is not known if her father intends to
‘appoint’ her; and adds the same note as *Saṃskāramayūkha*.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 136) quotes this verse and reproduces the same
explanation as above, and deduces the conclusion that ‘one should marry
the girl in whose case there is no fear of this.’

*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 699) quotes the verse and adds that ‘in a case
where there is no fear of the father having an intention of making the
girl an Appointed Daughter, one may marry the girl, even though she may
have no brother.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 80) as indicating that it is
possible for a daughter to be ‘appointed’ secretly; without her being
married under that expressed agreement;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra
p. 181), which adds the same note as *Saṃskāraratnamālā*.

She who has no brother,—such a girl one should not marry,—‘*for fear of
her having, the character of the appointed daughter*;’ *i.e*., by reason
of her being an ‘appointed daughter;’ *i.e*., by reason of there being
the doubt that the girl’s father might have performed those rites that
would have made her an ‘appointed daughter.’

“Why should such a doubt arise at all?”

Such a doubt would arise if the girl’s father is not known, having died
or having gone away to a foreign country. Under such circumstances, the
girl is given away in marriage either by her mother or by other members
of her father’s family. Since it is laid down that when the girl has
reached the marriageable age, if her father happen to be absent, she
shall be given away in marriage by the said relations.’ The exact rule
on this point we shall quote later on. If the father is known, however,
there is no fear of the girl being an ‘appointed daughter as he will
himself declare whether or not she has been ‘appointed.’

‘*Or*’ in the text should be taken in the sense of ‘if;’ the sense being
that ‘if the father is not known, the girl should not be married.’

Others have taken the two clauses as formulating two independent
prohibitions: (a) ‘If the father is not known’—*i.e*., if it is not
known from whom she is born; this being a prohibition of marrying the
girl of unknown parentage;—and (*b*) the next prohibition is to be
construed as ‘one should not marry the girl who has no brother, for fear
of her being an appointed daughter.’ They further point out that the
latter phrase, ‘for fear of her being an appointed daughter,’ cannot be
construed with the clause, ‘if her father is not known.’

In the whole of this section on Marriage, wherever the prohibition is
not based upon grounds that are not perceptible—*e.g*., ‘one should
marry a maiden who is not his father’s *sapiṇḍa*,’ etc., (when the
grounds of interdiction are trascendental, not perceptible, as in the
case of the prohibition of marriage with a diseased girl, etc.),—if the
prohibition is disobeyed, the ‘marriage’ itself remains unaccomplished.
Hence, if one happens to marry a girl belonging to the same *gotra* as
himself, the marriage, even though performed, would be as good as *not
performed*; and this for the simple reason that the character of
‘marriage’ is determined by scriptural injunction,—just like the
character of the ‘Fire-laying’ rite; and, hence, a transgression of the
injunction means the non-accomplishment of -the Rite. In the case of
Fire-laying, it is found that if there is omission of any subsidiary
detail, the *Āhavanīya*’ and other ‘Fires’ are not accomplished;
similarly, a girl that belongs to the same ‘*gotra*’ as a man can never
become the ‘wife’ of that man. Hence it has been ordained that such a
girl, even though she may have gone through the sacramental rites, shall
be given up. Further, in connection with such marriages, Vaśiṣṭha and
other revered writers have prescribed specie lexpiratory rites. Even
though, in reality, what each a marriage involves is only a discrepancy
in the Rite caused by the transgression of one of the interdictions
relating to a subsidiary detail,—and it does not involve any sin on the
part of the man,—yet the Expiratory Rite has to be performed, in view of
its being directly enjoined by the scriptures. Or, we may take it thus
that what is prohibited is ‘intercourse’ with a girl of the same
‘*gotra*,’ and the Expiatory Rite relates to the series of acts
perpetrated by the man (in the form of the marriage-ceremonies.)

As regards the prohibition of marriage with girls belonging to families
that may have dropped the sacred rites and so forth,—it is based upon
perceptible grounds; and, hence, when such girls are married, the
‘marriage’ is duly accomplished, the girl actually becomes the man’s
‘wife,’ and she shall not be given up. It is in view of this fact that
in verse 6, we have the laudatory epithet ‘even though they be great,’
which draws a line of distinction between the two sets of prohibitions.
Such also is the custom among all cultured people: they do occasionally
marry girls ‘with tawny hair,’ etc., but never one that belongs to the
same gotra.—(11)

In verse 4, we had the words ‘the twice-born person should take a wife,’
where the *wife* has been spoken of by means of a word ending in the
Accusative, which makes the *wife* th e *primary*, and the *marriage*
the *secondary*, object; and yet the singular number (in ‘wife’) is
meant to be duly significant; since it forms part of the predicate of
the sentence; just as we have in the case of the assertion, ‘he cuts the
*sacrificial post*.’ In the case of a thing whose character is
determined and known from other sources,—if such a thing happens to be
referred to in connection with the Injunction of some other act, it is
always understood to be referred to exactly in the form in which it has
been known; *e.g*., in the case of the injunction, ‘wash the cup;’ and
this for the simple reason that all ‘references’ are based upon wḥat is
previously known. Thus, in connection with the ‘cups,’ their *number* is
already known from such statements as ‘at the morning-extraction the
Adhvaryu takes up *ten* cups;’ their use also is already known from the
statement, ‘libations are poured with the cups;’ hence, in the
subsequent statement, ‘wash the *cup*,’ no significance is attached to
the singular number in the word ‘cup,’—this statementbeing construed in
connection with what is already known about it. In the present instance,
on the other hand, the thing concerned—the ‘wife’—is one whose character
has not been determined anywhere else; in fact, it is only from the
present text that we derive our knowledge of what the ‘wife’ is: hence,
we understand it exactly as it is here described; so that due
significance is to be attached to the number, just as much as to the
basic noun itself. All this we shall discuss with detailed arguments
under discourse V.

Thus then, due significance being attached to the (singular) number (in
the word ‘wife,’ as used in verse 4),—if one happens to marry a second
time, even though the marriage-rites might be duly performed, she does
not become a ‘wife;’ just as when one *Āhavanīya* is already there, the
second fire, even though duly kindled, does not become ‘*Āhavanīya*.’
But, under certain circumstances, the taking of a second wife is
considered desirable; and it is in connection with this second marriage
that we have the rules propounded in this and the following verses. It
is in view of this that Gautama has said—‘If one’s wife is endowed with
virtue and offspring, one should not take another; in the event of
failure on either of the two points, one may have another.’

‘*Of equal caste*,’—*i.e*., of the same caste.

‘*For the first*,’—first of all; *i.e*., for one who has not taken a
wife from a different caste; ‘*has been recommended*.’

Having married a girl of his own caste, if the man finds that she does
not inspire his love; or if the act of child-begetting is not
fulfilled,—then there comes about the man’s desire for another wife; and
then *these*—going to be mentioned below—‘*are to be regarded as
preferable*’— superior—on the strength of the scriptures.

This, then, is an exception to the rule regarding having only *one*
wife, as also to that of having a wife from one’s own caste.

*Objection*:— “The restriction appears to be upon the taking of a second
wife from one’s own caste; as the plurality (of wives) does not appear
to be sanctioned regarding girls of one’s own caste.”

*Answer*—All that the present text permits is the exceeding of the
number ‘one.’ And, if what is sanctioned is the exceeding of it by means
of marrying a girl of a different caste,—what is there that would
prevent one’s marrying (again) a second girl of his own caste? It is for
this reason that what Gautama has declared applies equally to all—‘if
there is failure in regard to either of the two, one may take another
wife.’ In the following verse also we read, ‘she and *one of his own
caste*,’ where also the second wife from one’s own caste is
permitted.—(12).

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted by Jīmūtavāhana (Dāyabhāga, p. 209);—and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 143) as providing permissible substitutes for the
proper ‘wife’;—it explains ‘*avarāḥ*’ (which it reads in place of
‘*varāḥ*’) as *jaghanyāḥ*, ‘lower’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 98), which
adds the following notes:—There are three classes of Marriage—(1) for
Dharma, (2) for offispring and (3) for physical pleasure; that for
offspring is obligatory, and for this one should have a girl of the same
caste as himself; and in that for Pleasure, or for avoiding the sin of
not entering the second life-stage, one may have girls of other castes,
even a Śūdra girl; in the former also, if no girl of the same caste is
available, girls of other castes may be taken.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
747), which adds the following explanations:—The term ‘*varṇa*’ stands
for *caste*;—‘*agre*’ means *the first marriage*;—the term ‘*dvijāti*’
indicates also persons born of the Śūdra through mixed marriages,
‘natural’ as well as ‘inverse—‘*praśastā*’ means that she is recommended
as the first and best alternative for taking a wife for the purposes of
(1) enjoyment, (2) begetting a son and (3) helping in religious acts
(these three being ‘*dārakarma*’ the *function of the wife*).

This is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 493), where we have
the following notes:—‘*Agre*’ means ‘at the first marriage of the
Accomplished Student.’;—‘*dārakarmaṇi*’—for the performance of the
Agnihotra and other rites;—‘*Savarṇā*’—‘she who has the same caste as
the bridegroom’ is recommended;—*i.e*., the Brāhmaṇī for the Brāhmaṇa,
the Kṣatriyā for the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya for the Vaiśya. Having, for
the sake of religious acts, married a girl of the same caste, if one is
desirous of ha ving more wives for purposes of physical enjoyment, he
may marry girls of lower castes (‘*avarāḥ*’) in due order;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 205), which says that the implication of
the text is that after one has married a girl of the same caste, he may
marry others of other castes also, but they will be less and less
desirable in order; this means that for the sake of Dharma one should
marry a girl of the same caste.

There being a distinction of castes, ‘one’s own caste’ constitutes the
(upward) limit. Just as for the Brāhmaṇa, there are Kṣatriya and other
wives, so it would seem as if for the Śūdra also there would be wives
belonging to the lower orders of ‘washer-woman and carpenter.’ In order
to preclude this possibility, the text lays down the restriction that
the *Śūdra* can have a wife from his own caste only. A wife of the
higher caste is precluded by the qualifying phrase, ‘in due order,’ in
the preceding verse.

‘*She*’—*i.e*., the Śūdra woman—‘*and girl of his own caste*’—*i.e*.,
the Vaiśya woman—‘for the Vaiśya.’

‘*Those two*’—the Vaiśya woman and the Śūdra woman,—‘*and* *the girl of
his own caste*’— ‘*for the Kṣatriya*.’

Similarly, ‘*for the Brāhmaṇa*.’

The right order would appear to be that the verse should begin with the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ but it begins with the ‘*Śūdra*’ which only goes to lend
strength to the aforesaid notion (that a wife of the higher class is not
permitted).

In this connection, it has been declared that ‘what is meant by the text
is that there should be *option* in order, and not a combination of all
(the several kinds of wives).’—(13)

Even when the Śūdra girl is extremely handsome, and the *Brāhmaṇa* or
*Kṣatriya* bridegroom is in the ‘tenth stage’ of his life,—he should
never marry the Śūdra girl.

On this point, a descriptive phrase is added—‘*under no circumstance
whatsoever*’—*i.e*., in no story at all—‘*has been ordained*’—
described.

‘*In peril*’—Even in the greatest distress.

In the preceding verse, the *Śūdra* wife has been permitted, and here
she is prohibited. Hence there should be option.

“Option is permissible only when there is possibility of the two courses
being adopted at one and the same time, and both courses are equally
sanctioned by scriptural injunctions; and it cannot be permitted when a
course of action is open to one only under the influence of passion,
while it is prohibited by scripture. In the case in question, the taking
of a Śūdra wife is not sanctioned by scripture, it is possible only
under the influence of passion; and all that the foregoing verse means
is that the marriage of a Śūdra girl under the influence of passion is
not entirely prohibited; the prohibition, on the other hand (contained
in the present verse), is purely scriptural. Hence the conclusion is
that the *Śūdra* girl should not be married at all. It is in view of
this that Yājñavalkya (*Ācāra*, 56) has declared.—‘It is said that
twice-born persons may take Śūdra wives; but that is not my opinion.”’

Our answer to the above is as follows:—In all cases, option is admitted
only in view of the likely futility of the injunction (of one or the
other coarse of action). If the *Śūdra-wife* were absolutely prohibited,
then the *Kṣatriya* and *Vaiśya* girls alone would have been mentioned
as permitted (to the Brāhmaṇa) in times of peril; and in that case, the
counter-exception (mentioned in 13), as also the prohibition (contained
in 14), would both be superfluous; as the marrying of the girl of one’s
own caste would have been already secured by the restrictive rule. Thus,
then, since there is a clear incompatibility between the sanction (in
13) and the prohibition (in 14), the two should be regarded as optional
alternatives.

“The presence of an option means that the agent may do what he likes;
and, as the marrying of the Śūdra girl (if one wishes to do so) would be
already secured by the counter-exception (in 13), there would be no need
for putting forward the prohibition (in 14) \[as the not-marrying of the
Śūdra girl is already deduced, from the general rule of marrying within
one’s own caste\].”

But the marrying of the *Śūdra* girl has not been left entirely to the
wish of the agent, in the way in which the marrying of *Kṣatriya* and
*Vaiśya* girls has been; in fact, it has not been permitted, except in
times of very great distress.

From all this the following conclusion appears the right one to
adopt:—The general rule regarding marrying a girl of one’s own caste
having already indicated, by implication, the impropriety of marrying
girls of other castes,—that the Śūdra girl should have been prohibited
again (in 14), already shows that the rule regarding not marrying girls
of other castes is not absolute; and since this rule is not absolute, it
follows that in times of difficulty, or in the event of not finding a
girl of his own caste, while the *Śūdra* girl shall never be married,
those of the other two castes may be married.—(14).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495) as
countenancing the view that it is better by far that the Brāhmaṇa and
the Kṣatriya should avoid a Śūdra wife altogether, even though he he
overpowered by lust;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 144), where the prohibition
herein contained is explained as referring to the *first*, marriage;—and
‘*āpat*’ is explained as ‘the contingency of not finding a girl of the
same caste’;—and it adds, on the strength of the next verse, that what
is here said is applicable to the Vaiśya also.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 749) quotes the verse and explains
‘*vṛttante*’ as ‘in a story.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 87), which adds that though the verse
mentions only the ‘Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya’ it does not mean that it
is permissible for the Vaiśya; all thaí is meant is that for the two
higher castes it is specially reprehensible;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 205), which says that this prohibition is meant for the
*first* marriage, as is clear from the foregoing verses.

This is a deprecatory exhortation, supplementing the foregoing
prohibition.

‘*Of the lout caste*’—*i.e*., of the Śūdra caste; the *Śūdra girl* being
the subject of consideration; and further, because the statement ends
with the assertion that the families along with offspring are reduced to
the position *of the Śūdra*.

‘*The twice-born men*, *through infatuation*’—*i.e*., on account of
folly arising from greed for wealth, or from lust,—‘*reduce their
families to the position of the Śūdra*.’ That is, sons born of that wife
become *Śūdras*, and so also grandsons and great-grandsons descended
from them. Hence, it is added—‘*along with their offspring*’—the term
‘*offspring*’ standing for the line of descendants, consisting of sons,
grandsons, &c.—(15).

‘*Śūdrāvedi*’ is one who acquires—*i.e*., marries—a *Śūdra* girl.

‘*Becomes an outcasts*’—*i.e*., as good as an outcaste.

Such is the opinion of Atri, and of Utathya’s son. The authorities have
been mentioned with a view to inspire respect.

The first half of the verse is supplementary to the prohibition
contained in the preceding verse.

‘*According to Śaunaka*, *by the birth of a child*.’ This is an entirely
different rule. It presumes that marriage with a Śūdra girl is
permitted, and then prohibits intercourse with her during her ‘courses’;
‘birth of a son’ is possible only by having intercourse on the even days
of the woman’s period. Thus the meaning is that ‘one should not have
intercourse with his Śūdra wife during her courses.’

‘*According to Bhṛgu, by having children from her*.’ This also is a
distinct rule by itself. ‘*Tadapalya*’ is one who has only such children
as. are born of his *Śūdra* wife; and the character of such a man is
called ‘*tadapatyatā*.’ This is the opinion of *Bhṛgu*; which means that
‘after one has begotten children from wives of the more respectable
castes, he may have intercourse with the Śūdra wife.’

The mention of ‘outcaste’ here is only meant to indicate degradation; it
does not mean that the man is to be actually treated as an ‘outcaste,’
as described under 11.182. All this we shall explain later on.—(16).
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

According to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nandana and Rāghavānanda, the
meaning of this verse is as translated. According to Nārāyaṇa’s
explanation, the translation would read as follows (rendered by
Buhler):—“A man of the family of Atri who weds a Śūdra female, becomes
an outcaste; one of the race of Utathya’s son, on the birth of a son;
and one of Śaunaka’s or Bhṛgu’s race, by having no other but Śūdra
offspring.’ Buhler adds—“It ought to be noted that, according to Kullūka
alone, the three classes refer to Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas
respectively. Rāghavānanda particularly objects to the opinion.”

Burnell ??tes that the rule attributed here to Gautama (Utathya’s ???n)
is not found in the Sūtras of Gautama, where we find only a general
statement regarding the unlawful character of Śūdra offsprings of
twice-born men. And Hopkins says the same thing in regard to the *Smṛti*
of Atri.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 750); neither of which provides any
explanation of this rather obscure verse;—in *Aparārka* (p. 88), which
explains the meaning to be that “according to Atri and Gautama, the
Brāhmaṇa marrying a Śūdra girl ‘falls’ by the mere act of marriage;
according to Śaunaka, by begetting a son on her; and according to Bhṛgu,
when a grandson is born from her;”—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 361),
which notes that this and the next verse are only meant to deprecate the
marrying of a *Śūdra* girl, ‘in the improper order’;—and in
*Smṛti-candrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 208), which adds the following notes:—The
Brāhmaṇa marrying a Śūdra girl becomes degraded,—this is the opinion of
Atri and of the ‘son of Utathya,’ *i.e*. Gautama;—hence according to
these authorities the Brāhmaṇa should never marry a Śūdra
girl;—according to Śaunaka, however, degradation results, not from
marrying, but from begetting a child on a *Śūdra* wife,—hence according
to him, the man should avoid the Śūdra wife during the
‘periods—according to Bhṛgu again, even the begetting of a child does
not lead to degradation, what leads to it is the circumstance that the
Brāhmaṇa has no children except those from his *Śūdra* wife,—so that
according to Bhṛgu only so long as he has not got a child from his
Brāhmaṇa wife shall the Brāhmaṇa avoid his Śūdra wife during the
periods’.

This is a laudatory exaggeration.

If on the Śūdra wife he begets a son, *he falls from Brāhmaṇahood itself
i.e*., the son becomes a non-Brāhmaṇa. This also is a deprecatory
exaggeration.

‘*Son*’—is in the masculine gender. So that (in the preceding verse
also) the term ‘*begetting of children*,’ ‘*sutotpattyā*,’ should be
taken to refer to the *male* child; even though in the compound the word
can be taken both ways—either as ‘*sutā*’ in the Feminine, or as
‘*suta*’ in the Masculine. It is with this view that we have pointed out
above that what is prohibited is intercourse with the woman on the even
days of her ‘period’ (as it is only by intercourse on those days that a
male child is born).—(17).

Hopkin’s remarks—“A significant alteration in the Mahābhārata 13.47.9
makes the last part of this verse read—‘He is nevertheless purified by a
ceremony known in law’.”—One fails to see what is ‘significant’ in this,
when Hindu law bristles with expiatory ceremonies in connection with
much more heinous offences than the marrying of a Śūdra wife.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.265, p. 1326) as meant to
indicate the gravity of the offence, and as laying down the actual
irrevocable loss of Brāhmaṇahood;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495)
as prohibiting the marrying of the Śūdra by the twice-born;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 750);—in *Aparārka* (p. 87);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 361);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 208),
which notes that what this forbids is the marrying and begetting of
child on a Śūdra wife before a Brāhmaṇa wife.

This prohibition pertains to all times.

Even if a Śūdra girl happens to be married, the rites, herein mentioned,
should not be performed in a manner by which she might dominate them.
That is to say, the Śūdra wife is not entitled to participate in the
husband’s religious acts, in the manner in which wives of the three
higher castes arc.

Since she is a ‘wife,’ it might be thought that she is so entitled; and
it is in view of the possibility of such notion being entertained that
we have the present prohibition. The meaning thus is that when one is
going to spend his wealth over some religious act, he need not seek her
consent, in the way he seeks that of his wives of the twice-born castes;
in other cases, however—such as the expenses incurred for seeking
prosperity and obtaining pleasure,—she is not to be disregarded. That
she should be employed, like a servant, during the performance of
*Śrāḍdha*, &c., is not prohibited; *e.g*., there would be no harm if she
were to thresh corn and so forth; but she should not be made to serve
food and do such other acts.

‘*Rites in honour of deities*’ are (1) the *Daśa-pūrnamāsa* and other
sacrifices, and (2) the feeding of Brāhmaṇas in honour of Deities, as
already explained by us under 2.180.

‘*Rites in honour* *of* *Pitṛs*’—*i.e*., Śrāddhas and offering of
water-libations.

‘*Rites in honour of guests*’—*i.e*., the reception and feeding of
guests, and offering them water for washing their feet, and so forth.

“The prohibition here put forth is already implied by the rule that
wives of one’s own caste should not be superseded by other wives.”

Not so; because the rule speaks of the wife of the same caste being
actually present. Hence people might he led. to argue as follows—“If the
wife of the Brāhmaṇa’s own caste happens to be in her courses, or
absent, then his Śūdra wife may preside over the rites, just like his
*Kṣatriya* and *Vaiśya* wives; further, the prohibition contained in the
rule referred to pertains, not to her title to preside, but simply to
the act of examining the clarified butter and so forth, which are done
by the wife in accordance with the rule that the clarified butter used
at sacrifices should be such as has been examined by the wife; and, as
the rule simply mentions the general name ‘wife,’ it may be taken to
mean that the act may be done by any wife that has been obtained.”

And it is with a view to prevent this being done,—and of wives of
different castes doing the said acts in the same way in which they are
done by any one wife from among several wives of the same caste,—that we
have the present prohibition.

The ‘*domination*,’ by the wife is due to her being entitled to the act.

‘*The deities and the Pitṛs do not eat of it*;’—this means that the acts
become futile.

‘*He does not go to heaven*;’—*i.e*., if the guest takes food, the
householder fails to attain Heaven, which he would attain as the result
of his having fed his guests. ‘*Heaven*’ here stands for all those
rewards that have been described as proceeding from the ‘honouring of
guests,’ and it is a reference to all that has been said under 3.
106.—(18).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 88), which explains it to mean
that ‘she should not be allowed to take a prominent part in the
offerings made to the Gods and Pitṛs;’—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 206), which explains ‘*tatpradhānāni*’ as ‘at which the Śūdra wife
presides.’

This is an exaggerated exhortation.

‘*Vṛṣalīphena*’ is the moisture of her mouth; he by whom this has been
drunk is ‘*vṛṣalīphenapīta*;’—the past participial adjective ‘*pīta*’
being put last by the analogy of such compounds as ‘*palāṇḍubhakṣita*,’
and so forth.

If we adopt the other reading ‘*vṛṣalīpītaphenasya*,’ then the compound
‘*pītaphenaḥ*’ is to be expounded as ‘*pītaḥ pheno yasya*;’ and this,
with the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ taken as an Instrumental *Tatpuruṣa*,—according
to Pāṇini 2. 1. 30. (the sense being ‘the moisture of whose mouth has
been drunk by a *Śūdra* woman’). Or, ‘*pītaphena*,’ expounded as above,
might be taken as forming a *Genetive Tatpuruṣa* with ‘*vṛṣalī*.’

The meaning is the same in all cases. When the husband and wife lie
together, the touching of their lips, etc., are inevitable. Hence, what
the word of the text indicates is *sexual intercourse*, by mentioning
something that is concomitant with it.

From the context it is clear that this verse is supplementary to the
foregoing prohibition, and it is not an independent assertion. If it
were an independent assertion, we should have the prohibition of
*kissing* only, and the other forms of intercourse would become
sanctioned; so that, by having intercourse with a *Śūdra* woman, only if
one avoids *kissing*, he would not be transgressing any scriptural
injunction.

‘*Who has begotten children on her*’—*i.e*., who has had intercourse
with her during her ‘courses.’

‘*Expiation*’—purification there is none. This indicates a high degree
of deprecation.—(19).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495) along with the
preceding four verses;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 75), where
‘*phenapītasya*’ is explained as ‘*pītamukhāsavasya*’, ‘he who has drunk
wine from the mouth.’
