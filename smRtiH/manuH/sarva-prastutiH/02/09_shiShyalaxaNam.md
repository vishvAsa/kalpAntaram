‘*The kindling of fire*’—*i.e*., setting the fire aflame every morning
and evening by supplying fuel to it.

‘*Sleeping on the ground*’;—*i.e*., not ascending a bedstead, not
actually sleeping on the hare ground.

‘*Teacher’s well-being*,’—*i.e*., service consisting of the fetching of
water in jars and such other work. As for the doing of things beneficial
to him, this is to be done throughout life.

All this should be done till that Final Bath, which consists in
returning from the Teacher’s house, and which constitutes the end of
Religious Studentship; for the simple reason that all this is included
in the Injunction of ‘Vedic Study.’ As a matter of fact, the life of the
‘student’ and its appurtenant details have to continue till the Veda is
completely got up; so that as soon as this getting up is done, the
discontinuance of the details follows as a matter of course.

The reiteration of the ‘kindling of fire’ and other duties in the
present verse is meant to indicate that the duties other than
those—which have been previously prescribed for students—are incumbent
upon persons in the succeeding stages of life also (and are not confined
to the ‘student’ only). As says Gautama (3.9),—‘All this is not
incompatible with the succeeding stages of life.’

“But why cannot we have this that the duties specified in the present
verse are to continue during the whole studentship stage, while others
might be discontinued even beforehand?”

The opinion of other *Smṛtis* on this point has been already shown to be
that all rules are laid down in connection with their principal time;
(and this time in the present case being the entire studentship-stage)
if the course just suggested were adopted (and some of the present
duties were dropped before the end of that stage), we would be
needlessly going against this principle.

In place of the expression ‘*gurorhitam*’ the right form would have been
‘*gurave hitam*’ in the Dative, accordingly to Pāṇini 2.1.36, which lays
down the use of the Dative in connection with the term ‘*hita*.’—(108)

‘Āsamāvartanāt ’—See 3. 3-4.

This verse, is quoted in Parāśaramādhava (Ācāra. p. 455), as laying down
the duties of the Student;—inVīramitrodaya (Saṃskāra, p. 489) as laying
down the ‘ miscellaneous duties ’ of the Student;—and in Aparārka (p.
76), as laying down the time-limit up to which the fire-tending and
other functions have to be kept up.

‘*Acting for the teacher’s well-being*.’ The details of this have been
described by Hārīta, quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 490)—‘By
fetching of water, Kuśa-grass, flowers, fuel, roots, fruits, sweeping
and washing of the house, bodily service and so forth,—he should
devotedly attend upon the Teacher, whose cast off clothes, bed and seat
he should never step over.’

This verse is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 46a);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 118), which adds that those mentioned here
indicate the other duties also.

devoted to the service of the Teacher.’

In verse 233 below the author is going to declare that ‘Of all gifts the
gift of the Veda is the best’; and the question arising as to the sort
of person to whom knowledge should be imparted—the present verse
proceeds to describe the characteristics of the recipient of knowledge.
And this contains the injunction of *teaching*, which is connected with
the section dealing with the duties of the student.

‘*The Teacher’s son*.’—‘*He who is eager to do service*,’
*i.e*.,—personal attendance, or other household work in accordance with
his strength, such as rubbing the body and so forth.

‘*One who imparts knowledge,’—such* knowledge as may not be known to the
Teacher, but which may have been learnt somehow by the pupil; *e.g*.,
sciences dealing with property, love and the arts, or with Dharma; the
teaching of suoh a pupil is by way of exchange of knowledge.

‘*One who is righteous* ';—he who makes it his chief business to perform
the Agnihotra and such religious acts.

‘*One who is clean*’;—one who keeps his body clean with clay and water.

The three words ‘righteous,’ ‘clean’ and ‘gentle’ are not needless
repetitions,—their use being similar to the use of such expressions as
‘*go-balīvarda*’ (where the second term serves to qualify the first).

‘*A near relatice*’—a friend or closely related person.

‘*One who is competent*’—capable of getting up and remembering texts.

‘*One’s own son*,’—who has been previously ‘initiated.’

These ten, even though ‘initiated’ by others, should be taught.

“The text uses the term *dharmataḥ*, which means that by teaching them
one acquires merit. But one who pays money clearly brings a visible
benefit to the teacher; wherefore then can there be any justification
for the assuming of an unseen result—in the shape of *merit*—in this
case?”

Who says that there is to be an *assumption* of unseen results? There
can be no *assumption* of what is directly stated. It has been
distinctly declared tbat “these ten should be taught ‘*for the sake of
merit*.’”

The revered teacher however says that what the term ‘*dharmataḥ*’ means
is that what is here stated is the rule of the sacred law; by teaching
these persons there is no transgression of the law. It does not mean
that by imparting knowledge to one who pays money the teacher acquires
the merit that results from the act of imparting knowledge.—(109)

‘*Dharmataḥ*’—‘According to the sacred law’ (Kullūka and Nandana);—‘for
the sake of merit’ (Medhātithi, Govindarājā and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 517) as laying
down the duties of the Teacher;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 51);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 812);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 140)
which explains ‘*śaktaḥ*’ as ‘capable of acquiring knowledge’ and
‘*jñānadaḥ*’ as ‘one who has imparted knowledge.’

*Medhātithi* (p. 125, 1. 22)—‘*Upādhyāyastu*’—This ‘*Upādhyāya*’ is
referred to several times. He is either Medhātithi’s teacher, or an
older commentator on Manu. The former is more probable.

If a person, who is not his regular pupil, but is reading near him,
should murder the text, or omit certain letters, or read with a wrong
accent,—the learned man should not, unless he is asked to (correct),
instruct the student and tell him ‘you have murdered the text, you
should read it thus.’ If the reader happen to he his own pupil, then he
should instruct him, even without being asked. If again the student were
to ask, but ask in an improper manner,—then also he should not instruct
him. The ‘proper manner’ of asking is to ask with due humility, in the
manner of a pupil, with such words as—‘in this matter I have a doubt,
pray instruct me on this point.’ In cases other than this, ‘*even though
knowing the* *truth*, *the wise man should behave*’—continue to
live—among men, ‘*as if ignorant*,’—as if he were dumb; *i.e*., he
should remain silent, as if he did not know anything.

This prohibition regarding the explaining of doubts without being asked
refers to scriptural matters; as regards temporal matters, the author is
going to declare that—‘Employed or not employed (by the king) the man
knowing the law should expound it.’ Others have held that the
prohibition contained in the present verse applies equally to both
scriptural and temporal matters.—(110)

The present text describes the evil effects of transgressing the above
prohibition.

He who instructs a pupil—‘you should read this’—in an unlawful manner,
either when he is not asked, or when he is asked in an unlawful manner;
and be also who asks in an unlawful manner;—both of these die, before
time. If only one of them happens to be the transgressor, then he alone
dies. When asked in an unlawful manner, if the wise man docs not
explain, then the questioner dies; but if he does explain, then both of
them die. This indication of the evil effects proceeding from improper
questioning clearly implies that for the questioner also there is a
proper manner of putting questions.

‘*Or incurs the ill-will*’—enmity—of the people.—(111)

It has been said above (in 109) that ‘these ten should be taught for the
sake of merit ’; of that same injunction the present verse supplies a
brief reiteration; it does not prescribe anything new, being merely
elucidatory of the preceding injunction.

‘*Wealth*’ should be taken as standing for *benefit* of all kinds; since
the preceding verse has spoken of teaching by way of exchange of
knowledge also.

‘*Adequate*’;—*i.e*., commensurate with the teaching; there being much
service it the teaching is much; and little service if the teaching is
little.

‘*There knowledge*’;—the term ‘knowledge,’ ‘*vidyā*,’ stands for that
*by means of which all things are known; i.e*., the reading of the text
as well as the grasping of the meaning. The meaning is that he who does
not bring any benefit should not be taught the text of the Veda, nor
should the explanation of tho meaning of Vedic texts be expounded to
him.

‘*Ūṣara*’—stands for that plot of land where, on account of the defects
in the soil, seeds do not sprout.

‘*Healthy*’;—corn-seeds of good variety are sown with the help of the
plough, etc. Similarly knowledge also bears excellent fruits when sown
(imparted) on good soil.

It should not be thought that, when one imparts knowledge when paid for
it, it becomes a case of mere barter; because the action (of teaching)
is not preceded by any bargaining as regards the price to be paid, such
as—‘if you give me such and such an amount, I shall impart to you such
an amount of teaching’; while such bargain is the necessary condition of
all ‘barter’; and the mere conferment of the slightest benefit does not
constitute ‘barter.’

Though verse 215 below says that ‘one should not confer any benefit upon
the teacher previously,’—yet this does not quite prohibit the previous
conferring of benefits; it is merely supplementary to the injunction
that ‘when the pupil is going to take the Final Bath, he should, when
asked to do so, bring for his Teacher all that may lie within his
power’; and it is not an independent statement by itself.—(112)

The term ‘*samam*’ means ‘along with.’

It is better that the ‘*expounder of the Veda*’—the student of the
Veda—should die along with his knowledge—unexpounded to any person, and
famishing in his own body—than that it should be taught to unfit
persons.

From what is here said it follows that one who has studied the Veda
should also teach it as a duty, and not merely for making a living; and
that it is not only a person desiring a certain result that is entitled
to the teaching; just as to the giving of water and such other acts it
is not only persons with some motive that arc entitled. Says the
Śruti—‘He who, having studied the Science, does not expound it to those
who need it, becomes an undoer of what he has done;—one should open the
door to welfare; and should teach others; this function of words the
poets describe as leading to fame; all this rests in this act; those
that know this become immortal.’

When the text calls the man ‘an undoer of what he has done,’ what it
means is that the omission of teaching constitutes an offence; and this
implies that teaching is something tbat must be done.

‘*On* *barren* *soil*’;—*i.e*., to a person in whose case none of the
three purposes are fulfilled.

‘*Even in dire distress*’;—*i.e*., e ven in times of troublous calamity;
the ‘distress’ here meant is the absence of properly qualified pupils.

All this would be justified only if teaching were something that must be
done.

“Teaching being compulsory, if fully qualified pupils be not available,
one might fulfil his duty of teaching by getting hold of substitutes,
for qualified pupils; just as in the absence of *Vrīhī* corn, sacrifices
are accomplished by means of *Nīvāra* corn.”

(With a view to guard against this, the text has added that) under the
said circumstances—when properly qualified pupils are not available, the
necessity of performing the work of teaching should cease; just as when
a properly qualified guest is not available, the necessity of the duty
of ‘honouring the guest’ ceases.

‘*Sow*’;—this term which is directly applicable to the seed, indicates
figuratively the work of *teaching*. Just as the seed sown in the field
produces a large outturn, so does knowledge also.

Others have explained ‘*distress*’ as standing for ‘want of wealth.’ The
sense in this case being that even though the man may be in the worst of
conditions, he should not sow in barren soil, he should rather die; and
by so doing the man could not be transgressing the injunction that ‘one
should protect himself from all dangers,’ even though he could have
within his reach the means of livelihood in the shape of teaching
unqualified pupils.

This explanation however is not right. The pupils who pay money cannot
bo called “barren soil”; the term ‘barren soil’ being only a reference
to what has gone in the preceding verses. If the ‘giver of wealth’ also
were not a qualified pupil, then how could there be any chance of the
teacher undertaking the work of teaching him in times of distress,—which
chance is prohibited iu the present verse?—(113)

‘*I am thy wealth*’—treasure —‘*guard me*.’

The question arising as to what would the ‘guarding of Learning,—it is
added—‘*Impart me not unto the*’—one who talks ill of, who despises.
That is, never teach a scorner.

‘*Thus may I become extremely powerful*.’—I shall be extremely useful to
you. ‘*Vīrya*’, ‘*power*,’ here stands for great efficiency in
accomplishing what is useful.

The insertion of the cerebral ‘in the phrase ‘*śevadhiṣṭe* *smi*’ is an

This verse is an adaptation of a very much older text. *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 515) quotes this latter text as ‘śruti’—

&gt; vidyā ha vai brāhmaṇamājagām  
&gt; gopāya māṃ śevadhiṣṭe'hamasmi \|  
&gt; asūyakāyānṛjave apatāya  
&gt; nā mām brūyāt avīryavatī tathā syām \|\|

Burnell and Hopkins remark as follows:—“This with verse 144, which
appears to have originally followed these verses as a whole, constitutes
a favourite saying of the Brāhmaṇas. These verses in an older form are
quoted in the Nirukta (ii-4), and (more like this present text) they
occur also in the *Viṣṇu* and *Vaśiṣṭha Smṛtis* s they also occur in
*Saṃhitopaniṣad-brāhmaṇa* of the Sāmaveda (pp. 29-30). The older form of
these two verses 114 and 115 (as well as 144) was in the *Tṛṣṭup* metre,
as in the Smṛtis just referred to.”

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 103)—where the Amarakoṣa is
quoted as explaining ‘*Śevadhi*’ as ‘*nidhi*,’ ‘treasure and ‘*asūyā*’
is defined as ‘tendency to fault-finding.’

It is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 523).

**(Verse 114-115)**

Viṣṇu-Smṛti (29.9-10),  
Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti (2.14-15).  
These authorities, along with Manu, paraphrase the text which is found
in Nirukta-Naigama Kāṇḍa, 2.4.

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, pp. 514-515).—‘One who teaches
the Vedas, the Dharma, the Purāṇas and the subsidiary sciences to one
who is endowed with character and is self-controlled and is ever
attentive.’

That pupil whom thou knowest to be ‘*pure*’
‘*self-controlled*’—*i.e*.,having full control over his senses; and *a
‘qualified student*,’ ever attentive ;—‘*unto him expound me*.’ He who
*guards his treasures*, being never careless; he never commits mistakes,
never fails, being ever attentive to his business.

What is deduced from this valedictory description is the advice that
learning should be imparted to the pupils already described above as
qualified (under 109), only when they fulfil the conditions described in
the present verse.—(115)

When one is reciting the Veda with a view to getting up the text, or
when one is expounding the Veda to another person,—if some one were to
come by and acquire the Vedic text for the first time, or should
surreptitiously have bis own doubts (on some point connected with the
Vedic text) removed,—then to him occurs the sin here described; so long
as he does not secure the Teacher’s permission, preferring, his request
in such words as—‘just as these pupils are reading with you, so may I
also read, kindly accord me your permission.’ And it is only when the
pupil has received this permission that he should be taught. Otherwise,
the reading of the Veda would be like ‘*stealing*’; and the learner,
being *corrupted with this sin of stealing the Veda, falls into
hell*—*i.e*., into a place of condign punishment.

The ablative ending in ‘*adhīyānāt*,’ ‘*from* *one who is, reciting
it*,’ is according to Pāṇini 1.4.29, according to which ‘the source of
proper instruction is put in the Ablative’;—or the Ablative may have the
sense of *separation*,—separation being implied by the fact that the
teaching appears to *issue from* the Teacher;—or the Ablative may have
the sense of the participle, being used in place of the affix ‘*lyap*,’
the meaning being—‘he learns after *having heard* another person who is
reciting it.’—(116)

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (30.42-43).—‘Until permitted by the Teacher, one should
not acquire knowledge from another person who may be reading with the
