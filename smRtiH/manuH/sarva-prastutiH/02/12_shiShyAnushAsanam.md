‘*Without injury*’—without beating.

‘*To living beings*’—i.e., to one’s wife, children, servants, pupils and
brothers;—‘*teaching for good should be imparted*.’ The generic term
‘beings’ has been used with a view to guard against the notion that what
is stated here should he done to *pupils* only. ‘*Śreyas*’ ‘*good*’
stands for the acquiring of seen and unseen results; the ‘*teaching*’ is
for the purpose of that acquisition; and it consists either in
instruction without the help of hooks, or in the teaching and expounding
of the scriptures.

What the present verse means is that, as far as possible one should
avoid too much heating and chiding; some slight chastisement has been
already permitted under Gautama 2. 42. 43.

*Question*.—“How then are they to he kept in the right path?”

The answer is supplied by the next line:—‘*Words sweet*’—gentle and
loving;—‘*soft*’—*i.e*., even when gentle, they should not he very loud
or haughty or harsh like that, of the crow. *E.g*., ‘dear child, read
on,—do not direct your attention elsewhere,—attentively finish this
chapter quickly and then you can immediately proceed to play with boys
of your own age.’ He who does not pay attention, even after being thus
spoken to—for him the proper method has already been laid down—‘by means
of a bamboo-piece.’

‘*Should he employed*’—spoken.

‘*By one desiring merit*’;—*i.e*., only by so doing does he acquire the
full merit of teaching.—(159)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

That, teacher, or any person, whose ‘*speech and mind*,’ even in the
presence of disturbing causes,—‘*are pure*’—do not become
perturbed;—‘*and properly guarded*,’—*i.e*., even when perturbation has
been caused, he does not make up his mind to injure other persons, nor
does he have recourse to activity calculated to harm them: all this is
what is meant by the ‘guarding’ of speech and mind.

‘*Been*’—is added with a view to show that what is laid down applies to
each and every man, and not to the teacher only, and that also only at
the time of teaching.

‘*He obtains the whole reward*.’

The term ‘*vedānta*’ in the text stands for ‘*vedasiddhānta*,’ ‘*canons
of the Veda*’; the term ‘*siddha*’ being deleted in the same manner as
the term ‘*atyanta*’ has been held to be dropped in the term ‘*siddhe*’
as occurring in the declaration ‘*siddhe śabdārthasambandhe*, etc.’ (in
the *Mahābhāṣya*),

The term ‘*vedānta*’ therefore stands for the ‘canons’—established
doctrines—contained in the Vedic texts—wherein it lias teen
‘*recognised*’ that ‘such and such results proceed from such and such an
act’—a fact that is accepted by all persons learned in the Veda;—the
whole of such results ‘*he obtains*.’

By the present statement the author has made it clear that the proper
control of speech and mind is helpful in the ordinary life of man, as
also in sacrificial performances. For, if it were meant to he helpful
only in ordinary life, then its transgression would involve the omission
of only what is helpful to man in his ordinary life; and in that case
the transgression not causing any deficiency in any sacrificial
performance, why should not the man with unguarded speech and mind
obtain the full reward of these latter? And yet what the text says is
that ‘it is the self-controlled man that obtains the whole reward.’

Others have explained the term ‘*vedānta*’ to mean the *Esoteric
Brahmaṇas* (Upaniṣads). And by this explanation the passage means that
the man obtains the whole of that reward which consists in the
‘attaining of Brahman,’ which has been postulated, in the said esoteric
treatises, as proceeding from the performance of the compulsory duties,
and also from that of those restraints and observances which have been
laid down without reference to any rewards.

If it be asked how pan the compulsory acts be held to bring about a
result in the shape of attaining Brahman?”—our answer is simply that
such an opinion has been held by some persons.

Or again, the term ‘*redānta*’ may be explained as the ‘end’ of the
teaching ‘of the Veda’; and the result obtained is that which proceeds
from this teaching;—*i.e*., the result in the form of having fulfilled
the injunction of ‘becoming a teacher.’ By this explanation, what is
laid down in the text would become entirely subservient to the
‘injunction of teaching.’—(160)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Vedāntopagatam*’—‘*Vedānta*’ stands for the Upaniṣads, and the
‘reward’ is Final Release (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa Nandana and
Rāghavānanda);—it stands for the ‘doctrines of the Veda’, and ‘reward’
stands for the results accruing from the sacrifices and rites prescribed
in the Veda (Medhātithi).

*Medhātithi* (P. 140, l. 26)—‘*Kratupuruṣobhayadharmatā*’—Details
prescribed in the Veda have been grouped under three heads—(1)
*puruṣārtha*, (2) *kratvartha* and (3) *kratupuruṣobhayārtha*.

\(1\) The *Darśapūrṇamāsa* sacrifices belong to the *puruṣārtha* class,
as they accomplish something agreeable and desirable for the agent;—

\(2\) all material substances and their purifications and preparations
are *kratvartha*, as they are directly helpful in the accomplishment of
the sacrifice;—

\(3\) certain things come under both categories; e.g. *Curd* is
mentioned in one place simply as a substance to be offered, where it is
only *kratvartha*; while in another place, it is mentioned as the
substance to be offered for the sake of one who desires efficient
sense-organs, in which case it becomes *puruṣārtha*. (See *Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsā*, pp. 197-199).

This is another duty laid down for man in relation to ordinary life.

‘*Aruntadaḥ* (?)’ means *that* *which* *cuts—‘tudati*’—*the ritats*
(?)—‘*arūṃṣi*’; *i.e*., affecting the vitals;—he who utters such
words—*i.e*., such words of chiding as are extremely painful,—is called
‘*aruntudaḥ*.’

‘*Pained*’;—even though pain may have been indicted on him by the other
person, he should not utter unpleasant words.

Similarly ‘*injury to others*’ is ‘*harming others*’; and one should not
do an act conducive to it; nor should he think of it.

Or, ‘*paradrohakarmadhīḥ*’ may he taken to mean ‘think of doing injury
to others.’

Such words by which—even though uttered in joke—other persons are
pained—one should not utter.

Even a part of the sentence uttered by one should not he so
disagreeable; for even portions of sentences may become indicative of
unpleasant notions, through the force of their meaning, the particular
context (occasion) and so forth.

One should not utter such words as they are ‘*alokyā*,’—*i.e*.,
obstructing his passage to the heavenly regions.

When the student goes to beg for food, or when the teacher is teaching
at home for livelihood,—if he fails to win reverence, he should not
allow his mind to be perturbed by it; on the other hand, ‘*he should
shrink from reverence*’; *i.e*, if what is given to him is given with
due respect, he should not regard it as sufficient (simply on that
account).

‘Like nectar,’ ‘*he should a* *lways* *seek for
disrespect*,’—ill-treatment. The genitive ending has been used (in
‘*avamānusya*’) by imposing upon the root ‘*ākāṅkṣa*’ the sense of the
root ‘*iṅ*’ with the preface ‘*aḍhi*,’ *i.e*., the sense of *thinking
of*; and thus bringing it under Pāṇini’s sūtra 2.3.52, by which the root
‘*iṅ*’ with ‘*aḍhi*,’ governs the genitive. It is on the basis of this
similarity that ‘anxiety’ is present in both (*desire* and *thought*).

“But what is not offered with respect should not be eaten.”

True; but what the present verse does is to prohibit the perturbation of
mind; and.it does not mean tbat food offered with disrespect should be
eaten. The sense of all this is that one should look equally upon
respect and disrespect; and not that he should actually hanker after
disrespect.

Further, the Religious Student may accept even such food as is offered
with disrespect; for it is not a regular gift, and hence, does not come
under 4.235, where the receiving of gifts offered without respect is
decried.—(163)

He who is not perturbed by dishonour or scorn ‘*sleeps in comfort*’:
otherwise he would be burning with resentment and would not get any
sleep; and on waking up, he would still be thinking of the dishonour,
and would find no comfort. On rising from sleep, he moves about his

‘*Sanctified in self*’—*i.e*., duly initiated,—‘*the twice-born man
should, by the adoption of this course, accumulate sanctity*.’ ‘*This*’
refers to all those duties that have been laid down for the Religious
Student, from verse 70 onwards. The meaning is that *anena
kramayogena*—by the orderly carrying out of the host of injunctions, one
should accumulate ‘*sanctity*’—self-purification, consisting in freedom
from sin; just as freedom from sin is attained by means of the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* and other austerities, so also is it attained by means of
the course of restraints and observances prescribed in connection with
the study of the Veda. For this reason one should accumulate it,
‘*gradually*,’—without haste, be should acquire it and go on enhancing
it.

‘*Course*’ is ‘process’;—‘this should be done after having done that,
and so forth’; *e.g*., ‘Preceded by the uttering of the syllable *om*,
etc.’ (as laid down in verse 81); and the ‘*adoption*’ of this is taking
up of the performance.

‘*For the learning of the Veda*,’—for the purpose of learning it;
*learning* stands for the *getting up of the text* and *understanding of
the meaning*.—(164)

Curiously enough Buhler’s translation omits the phrase ‘*gurau vasan*’,
rightly rendered by Burnell as ‘while dwelling with his guru.’

‘*Vedādhigamikam tapaḥ*.’—“Sanctity for the learning of the Veda”
(Medhātithi);—‘austerity consisting of Vedic study’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana).

‘*By means of austerities*’—such as the Cāndrāyaṇa and the like;—‘*of
various kinds*’—of such diverse forms as eating only once, eating during
the fourth part of the day and so forth; but without injuring the body.

‘*Observances*’—such as the ‘*Upaniṣad*,’ (?) the ‘*Mahā* *nāmnikā*’ and
so forth.

‘*Prescribed by rule*’—laid down in the *Smṛtis* dealing with domestic
rites.

By means of the above, duly performed, *one should learn the entire
Veda*.

Some people have held that—“in the preceding verse the term ‘*tapas*’
stood for the duties of the Religious Student, and those same are meant
by the term *tapoviśeṣa* in the present verse.”

But this is not right; because all those are included under the term
‘*vrata*’ ‘observances.’ The term ‘*vrata*’ stands for those
restrictions that are based upon scriptures; and thus ‘*vrata*’ being a
generic term, the Mahānāmnikā and the rest also become included under
it. Hence by ‘observances’ here are meant fasting and the rest.

In connection with this verse some people have held that significance is
meant to be attached to the singular number in ‘*vedaḥ*’; and they argue
thus:—

“It is true that the affix ‘*tavya*’ (in the word ‘*adhiganta* *vyaḥ*’)
already indicates that the injunction intends the Veda to be the
predominant factor; but in view of the injunction and its
subject-matter, it is clear that the Veda is really subservient to the
‘learning of its meaning’; and the subserviency of the Veda being
accepted as meant, the proper examination of the injunction leads to the
conclusion that the function of the pupil in regard to the Veda extends
up to the learning of the meaning. The sense of the injunction thus
comes to be this—

‘By means of the Veda duly studied one should learn its meaning.’ If the
injunction did not mean this, the Veda could not be regarded as
*something to be cuff incited*; anything that is *cultivated* or
refined, is so done only as subservient to, and aiding in, something
else; and as regards the Veda, it has been already found that its use
lies in bringing about the knowledge of what is contained in it. If this
were not so, the predominance (of the Veda), even if directly expressed,
would he abandoned; just as in the case of the injunction ‘*juhoti*,’
the predominance of *saktu* is relinquished and the text is construed as
‘*saktubhiḥ*,’ (thus making the subordinate to the *Libation*). Further,
the verbal root actually used in the text denotes *understanding*:
‘*adhigamana*,’ ‘learning’ (which is what is expressed by the root in
‘*adhigantavyaḥ*’), means *knowledge*, in accordance with the dictum
that ‘all roots denoting *motion* denote *knowledge*’; and as for the
getting up of the verbal text of the Veda, this has been already laid
down before, under verse 71; so that what the present injunction does is
to lay down that the said *getting up of the text* is to be carried on
till the meaning becomes duly comprehended.

“Then again, it is just because the singular number in ‘*vedah*’ in this
passage is regarded to be significant that the injunction herein
contained is not recognised as laying down the study of several Vedas,
and hence its scope is going to be extended with a view to include such
study by what is going to be said later on, under 3.2.

“If then, there is to be a study of s *everal* Vedas, where would be the
use of significance being attached to the singular number in the present
verse?

“It is certainly of use; it serves to indicate that even by the study of
a single rescensional text one is to be regarded as having fulfilled the
injunction of ‘Vedic study,’ and that the study of several Vedas is
purely optional.

“If the study of several Vedas is not actually prescribed by injunction,
what lunatic would he there who would torture himself by the tattering
of teeth (involved in the learning of several Vedas)?

“But there *is* the other injunction—‘Having learnt the *Vedas*, etc.’
(3.2); this learning is for one who desires a particular reward, and
this reward is *Heaven*. Or, if we have some assertions made in
continuation of the said injunction, referring to ‘streams of butter’ or
some such thing,—then these may be regarded as the reward (of learning
*several* *Vedas*).

“As for the injunction of the study (of one Veda) by the Religious
Student, it pertains to the *learning of the meaning*, and serves a
perceptibly useful purpose; *e.g*., the knowledge of what the Veda says
is found to be of use in the actual performance of religious acts; and
in fact it is only the man so learned that is entitled to their
performance. The learning of *several* Vedas, on the other band, serves
a purely imperceptible purpose. If this were not so, then, the
injunction of ‘Vedic Study’ having been fulfilled by the study of a
single Veda, the assertion of ‘having studied the *Vedas*’ (3.2) would
be entirely superfluous,—if it were not an injunction of learning
several Vedas for the purpose of acquiring *merit* (an imperceptible
reward).”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—How can the view here put forward
be acceptable?—since there is the single injunction—‘the Veda should be
learnt’; and if this be regarded as not pertaining to an imperceptible
transcendental result,—on the ground (1) that it is an injunction of
sanctification, and (2) tbat it is of use only in the performance of
perceptible acts—then the same can be said in regard to the study of
several Vedas also; for the same conditions are present there also. And
further, according to the view in question, there would be a diversity
(in regard to the Veda): in one case (that of the single Veda) it would,
like the injunction of fire-laying, be related to all compulsory and
optional acts, through the comprehension of its meaning; while in the
other (that of several Vedas), it would be directly conducive to a
desirable result.

It might be argued that “the injunction of the learning of several Vedas
is a distinct injunction, and it is not based upon the injunction of
‘becoming a teacher’ (as the injunction of learning *one* Veda is); so
that it is only one who desires a particular reward that is entitled to
the former.”

But this is not right; as a matter of fact, it is not a distinct
injunction at all; there is only one injunction bearing upon the
question,—*viz*., ‘ The entire Veda should be learnt’; and what the
other passage—‘Having learnt the Vedas, etc.’ (3.2)—does is to restrict
the number of Vedas learnt to *three* only, in view of the possibility
of the idea being entertained that the singular number (in the
injunction ‘the *Veda* should be learnt’) not being meant to be
significant, one might study as many recensional texts as he
could,—five, six, even seven. Then again, in the passage under question
(3.2) we do not find the injunction in the form ‘one should learn,’ the
actual words of the injunction being ‘*O should enter the state of the
House-holder*.’

Then again, what has been said above iu regard to significance being
attached to the singular number in ‘*Vedaḥ*’ is absolutely incoherent.
Such significance should be based upon direct injunction, and not merely
upon argument and reasoning; and in the case in question what the
Injunction lays down is‘learning for the acquiring of the Vedic text,’
and the predominance of this ‘learning of the text,’ indicated by means
of the two words ending with the Accusative ending, does not cease
merely on the ground of its subserviency to the ‘comprehension of the
meaning.’ If such reasoning were accepted, significance would have to be
attached to the singular number in ‘*graham*’ (in the passage ‘*graham
sammārṣṭi*,’ ‘wash the cup,’); for the cup, even though the predominant
factor, does become subservient to the ‘washing’; but no such
subserviency is directly expressed by word,—as there is in the case of
the passage ‘*grahair-juhoti*,’ where the words directly express the
subserviency of the ‘cups’ to the ‘*Homa*.’ Thus it is clear that the
predominance of ‘Vedic Study’ is distinctly indicated by the direct
denotation (of the Accusative ending), and also by Injunction; and the
predominance being thus expressed, no significance can be attached to
the singular number.

“Well, if the purposes of the injunction of ‘Vedic Study’ are
accomplished by the getting up of a single Veda, it behoves you to point
out the use of learning several Vedas.”

This we shall explain under Chapter III.

“If the Injunction of Vedic Study extends up to the learning of the
meaning also, then, even after the text of the Veda has been got up, so
long as the meaning has not been learnt, there would be no cessation of
the performance of such Restraints and Observances as the avoiding of
honey, meat, etc.—‘What harm is there in that?’—It would be contrary to
the usage of cultured persons: cultured persons do not avoid the eating
of honey, meat, etc., after they have got up the Vedic text, even though
they continue to listen to the expounding of its meaning.”

There is no force in this objection. For there is another law which
says—‘Having learnt the Veda, one should bathe’; and here ‘having
learnt’ refers to the mere reading of the text, and ‘should bathe’
indicates the abandoning of all those Restraints and Observances that
constitute the auxiliaries to ‘Vedic Study’; for Bathing is as much
prohibited (for the Vedic Student) as Honey and Meat; so that when
Bathing is permitted by the said law, it permits the use of Honey and
the rest also, by reason of their association, and also on account of
the prohibition of all these occurring in the same context. As for
intercourse with women (which also is prohibited along with Bathing,
etc., for the Vedic Student), this forms the subject of a separate
prohibition—‘With his life of continence unperturbed, etc.’, (*Manu*,
3-2); and the transgression of this during the time that one is learning
the meaning of Vedic texts would do no violation to the Injunction of
Vedic Study; for during the said time, ‘continence’ does not form a
necessary factor of ‘study’; as all Restraints and Observances cease
after the getting up of the text. Then again, this prohibition (of
intercourse with women) is meant to fulfil some purpose for the man (and
hence not compulsory); it is for this reason that in the event of
transgression occurring in some way or the other, there is the expiation
laid down (in 11.118) for the Vedic Student commiting adultery; and what
the prescribing of this special expiation indicates is that the emission
of semen being a delinquency on the part of the person who is still
keeping the Restraints and Observances (as is clear from 11.120),—this
case would not be met by the ordinary expiatory rites of the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ and the rest, laid down in connection with ‘minor sins.’

“What are the grounds for taking the expression ‘should bathe’ as
figurative (and indicative of the discontinuance of Restraints and
Observances)?”

Our answer is as follows:—The ‘bathing’ herein laid down could not
consist of the mere washing of the body with water; for if it were so,
then what is enjoined would have to be regarded as serving some
transcendental purpose; on the other band, the Restraints imposed upon
the Vedic Student stand in need of the mention of some time at which
they could be discontinued; so that if the Injunction is taken as
indicating this limit of time, it comes to supply a much-needed
information.

“But these Restraints do not stand in need of any other limit; they are
meant to subserve the injunction of Vedic Study; so that the fulfilment
of that injunction would be their natural limit; the fulfilment of the
injunction consists in the accomplishment of its object; its object is
*study*; and the accomplishment of study is something that is easily
perceived. \[Hence there can be no point in taking the expression
‘should bathe’ as indicative of the limit of the Restraints and
Observances.\]”

This would be quite true, if the injunction of Vedic Study rested merely
on what is directly expressed by it. As a matter of fact, however, its
object embraces things not so expressed; for instance, the comprehension
of the meaning of Vedic texts resulting from the said study is also
included in the object of the said Injunction; because if it were not
so, then the Injunction would fail to be sanctiftcatory in character. In
fact, if the Injunction rested entirely in what is directly expressed by
it, it would lose its injunctive character itself; for the
*injunctiveness* of the Injunction consists in its urging the agent to
accomplish what it denotes; and ‘what it denotes’ consists of (*a*) the
result to be accomplished, (*b*) the means of accomplishing it and (*c*)
the procedure adopted; and iu as much as all these three are expressed
by a single word, none of them can be regarded as beyond what is denoted
by the Injunction. Thus then, in the injunctive verb ‘*udhīyīta*’
‘should study,’ the thing to be accomplished is what is determined by
the verbal root ‘to study,’—and the ‘procedure’ consists of the keeping
of Restraints and Observances. As a matter of fact, this injunction, by
itself, is not capable of bringing about the fulfilment of what it
denotes; because in the case of every Injunction the full accomplishment
of what it denotes is obtained through the execution of an object; and
the execution of the object of the injunction in question is already
accomplished by the force of another Injunction. For instance, for the
Teacher, there is the Injunction—

‘Having initiated the pupil, he should teach him the Veda’; and as the
work of ‘teaching’ cannot be accomplished without the work of
‘learning,’ the Teacher, with a view to the accomplishing of the
injunction of his own duty, urges the boy to the work of ‘learning’; and
it is not possible for the boy, without being urged by the Teacher, to
accomplish the act, merely on the strength of his own knowledge of the
injunction. From all this it follows that the act of ‘learning the Veda’
should be regarded as prompted by the injunction addressed to the
Teacher. And when the act is accomplished by being prompted by that
injunction, there is no need for any other injunction proscribing the
pupil’s act of ‘learning.’ Thus then, being devoid of prompting force,
what sort of injunctive character could belong to the Injunction in
question (‘the entire Veda should be learnt’)? In face of this
possibility of the Injunction losing its character, we have to look out
for some such method whereby it would acquire the requisite prompting
force. And the only sure way of doing this is to regard it as an
injunction of embellishment. Nor would the embellishment in question be
entirely useless; for it is only when the learning (of the Vedic text)
has been accomplished, that the pupil derives knowledge of some sort of
meaning, which latter knowledge becomes useful in the performance of all
those acts (that are laid down in the Veda). From this it is clearly
perceived that the Injunction in question lays down the necessity of
acquiring the knowledge of the meaning of the texts that have been
learnt in the course of ‘Vedic Study.’ Though from the very nature of
things, the meaning of the texts becomes comprehended as soon as the
texts have been heard,—yet such a comprehension is never definite and
sure. Hence the prompting done by the Injunction is towards that method
by which the said knowledge may become definitively certain. This
*certainty* comes about when one has pondered over the subject and
succeeded in setting aside all doubts; and the doing of this *pondering*
is not found to be indicated by any other means of knowledge; it is
certainly not prescribed by the injunction of ‘becoming a Teacher,’—as
this latter is accomplished by the learning (by the pupil) of the mere
verbal text. Nor is it indicated by any visible purpose to be served by
it; for what purpose of man is there which could not be fulfilled
without the said *pondering*,—and for the fulfilling of which one would
undertake it?

“Just as for one who desires to acquire landed property, the performance
of the act conducive to it is likely to be taken up by chance (or
whim),—the same might be the case with the pondering in question also.”

But in that case, there being no certainty regarding the whims and
desires of men; it is just possible that some one might not do the
pondering at all; or even if he did do it, he might not do it
immediately after the learning of the Vedic text.

Thus then, this part (of study) not being indicated by any other means,
it comes to be regarded as falling within the province of the Injunction
in question, in accordance with the principle that that alone forms the
subject-matter of an Injunction which is not got at by any other means.
Since then, (*a*) the ‘learning of the text’ is already got at by other
means,—(*b*) since the comprehension of the meaning which follows, by
the very nature of things, upon the mere reading is uncertain and
indefinite,—(*c*) since such comprehension serves no useful
purpose,—(*d*) since even after the sanctificatory learning of the text
has been accomplished, it is only the definite knowledge of its meaning
that serves the useful purpose of helping the performance of acts,—and
(*e*) since the said definite-knowledge is obtained only by means of
pondering,—it follows that it is necessary to do this *pondering* during
a well-defined time; and for the due accomplishment of this pondering,
the Injunction in question comes to be one pointing to it as its
ultimate purpose.

It is for this reason that in regard to the Restraints there arises the
doubt as to whether they arc to end with the learning of the words heard
from the mouth of the Teacher, or they are to go on with the enquiry
into the meaning of these texts, till this is definitely
ascertained,—the necessity of learning this meaning being indirectly
implied. Such being the doubt, the direction that, ‘One should bathe
after having learnt the Veda,’ serves to indicate the limit of the
observance if the said Restraints; and since the indirect indication of
this direction is equally helpful to the subject-matter in question, and
to the settling of the doubtful point, it is only right to accept the
said indication.

“Why is it said that the comprehending of the meaning is not directly
laid down? As a matter of fact, the words used are that ‘the Veda
*should be learnt*,’ which directly speaks of the said comprehension. In
the Veda as well as in other *Smṛtis*, we find such directions as
‘Learns the Veda,’ and ‘The Veda should be studied.’ And since the rule
laid down by Manu also is based upon those directions, its meaning must
be the same as that of these directions.”

The ‘learning’ spoken of in the directions (‘*tatyaḥ*’) refers to that
comprehension of meaning which is only indirectly implied. Or,
‘learning’ may stand for the getting up of the verbal text only; and the
necessity of learning the meaning would be deduced from the reasoning
expounded above. Nor is there any incongruity in the conclusion that,
though the Injunction in question is one only, yet one part of it—that
pertaining to its subject-matter—is prompted by the Injunction of
‘becoming a teacher,’ and another portion of it is prompted by itself.
Though this involves a diversity, there is nothing wrong in
this,—representing as it does, what is a mere fact.

It has been urged that “it is only right that several Vedas should be
learnt for the purpose of accomplishing a transcendental result.”

We shall answer this under 3.1.

The term ‘*veda*’ denotes that textual rescension which consists of the
collection of Mantra and Brāhmaṇa passages. But in actual usage the term
‘*veda*’ is applied to *portions* of that collection also. Hence, in
order to remove all doubts on the point, the text has added the
qualification ‘entire.’ As a matter of fact, the learning of a single
sentence cannot be regarded as fulfilling the ‘learning of the Veda,’
for the simple reason that the other sentences also are ‘Veda,’ and the
said ‘learning of the Veda’ is a sanctificatory act; just as in the case
of the ‘sacrificial cups’ \[the ‘washing’ of a *single* cup is not
regarded as fulfilling the ‘cup-washing,’ which h as been proscribed as
a sanctificatory act\]. Still, with a view to make this quite clear, the
text has added the word ‘entire.’

Others explain the term ‘entire’ as meant to include the Subsidiary
Sciences. The term ‘*veḍa*’ itself stands for the entire collection of
sentences above referred to; so that if one were to learn a single verse
less than that, he would not be regarded as having ‘learnt the Veda.’
Thus (the learning of the *whole* Veda being implied in the term ‘Veda’
itself), the addition of the epithet ‘entire’ could only be for the
purpose of including the Subsidiary Sciences. This is what h as been
declared in another *Smṛti* also—‘That the Veda along with its six
subsidiaries shall be learnt is the duty of the Brāhmaṇa.’

“All that the present verse says is that what is called ‘Veda’ should be
learnt *entire*; and certainly the Subsidiary Sciences are not called by
the name ‘Veda’; what then is there which signifies that the Veda should
be learnt *along with the Sciences*? As for the law—‘the Veda with its
six subsidiaries should be learnt,’—here we find the Subsidiary Sciences
mentioned by their own name; while in the present verse the adjective
‘entire’ qualifying the ‘Veda,’—how could the Subsidiaries be included?”

Our answer is as follows:—As a matter of fact, the present verse is
based upon the *Śruti*—‘the Veda shall be learnt’; and it has been
established that this ‘learning’ is meant to extend up to the full
comprehension of the meaning; this comprehension is not possible without
the help of the Subsidiary Sciences. It is thus that these sciences
become included by implication; and thus the learning of Elucidations,
Etymologies, Grammar and Exigetics also becomes implied by the same
Injunction. For these reasons, the inclusion of the Subsidiary Sciences
being admitted, it is only right that the term ‘entire be taken as
indicating the same fact.

The Nirukta (Etymological Explanations) and the rest are ‘*aṅgas*,’
‘parts,’ of the Veda, but not in the sense in which the hands and feet
are ‘limbs’ of man’s body, being its component parts; the Subsidiary
Sciences are not components of the Veda; in fact they are called
‘limbs,’ ‘*aṅgas*,’ of the Veda only figuratively; the sense being that
without these the Veda is not able to accomplish its purposes; and hence
they are as if they were ‘limbs’ of it. It is in view of this figurative
signification of the term ‘Veda,’ that the adjective ‘entire’ should be
explained.

‘*Along with the Esoteric treatises*.’—The Upanisads are the ‘esoteric
treatises.’ Though these also are ‘Veda’ they have been mentioned
separately, on account of their great importance.—(165)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 505), where it is
explained that though the adjective ‘*kṛtsnaḥ*,’ ‘entire,’ qualifies
‘*Veda*’, yet what is meant is one *entire śākhā* of the Veda, and not
*all the śākhās* of a Veda; and hence the upshot is that the entire
*śākhā* of a Veda should be studied by one who has been sanctified by
the sacraments prescribed in the *Gṛḥyasūtra* of that *śākhā* to which
his forefathers belonged.

*Medhātithi* (P. 152, 1. 1)—‘*Satyapi vedatve?*—On p. 140, 1. 3,

honey, meat, perfumes, garland and the like;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*

Duty; on account of deviation from the observances, no sages appear

The *repeating* of the Text for the purpose of getting it up, which
comes up as supplementary to the subject-matter of the context, is here
re-iterated for the purpose of eulogising it, and not for enjoining it
again.

The term ‘*constantly*’ refers to the time of study only.

The term ‘*tapas*,’ ‘*piety*,’ stands for fasting and such other bodily
mortifications; but in the present context it denotes figuratively that
spiritual faculty produced by the mortifications which consists in the
capacity to grant boons and pronounce curses.—‘*Tapasyan*’ stands for
‘desiring to acquire’ the said *piety* by means of bodily
mortifications; the root (in ‘*tapasyan*’) denoting the bodily
sufferings undergone in the process of *acquiring*. The *Parasmaipada*
ending (in ‘*tapasyan*’) is justified on the ground that the participle
is not intended to have the force of the reflexive-passive (in which
case alone the Ātmanepada ending would be necessary, by Pāṇini’s Sūtra
3.1.88).

The second half of the verse is a recommendatory reiteration, supplying
the reason for what lias been asserted in the first half.

Whatever ‘penance’ there is on the Earth, the ‘repeating of Veda’ is
superior to all. This is meant to eulogise the act as leading to results
similar to those brought about by all the austerities.—(166)

This is another commendatory statement pertaining to the injunction of
Vedic Study contained in the Vājasaneya-Brāhmaṇa.

The construction is—‘*ā* *nakhāgrebhya eva*.’

‘*Ha*’ denotes *hearsay*.

The term ‘*highest*’ having already signified the high character of the
penance, the phrase ‘*to his very nail-tips*’ h as been added with a
view to expressing the fact that the penance intended is higher even
than the highest; the sense being that even though the nail-tips are
insensible, yet they also are affected by the penance; the *Kṛcchra* and
other penances, not pervading over tho nail-tips, are not productive of
all that is desirable; but the penance in question reaches even those
tips. This is the special praise bestowed upon the penance.

‘*Tapyate tapaḥ*’;—tbe augment ‘*yak*’ and the *Ātma* *nepada* ending
are in accordance with Pāṇini 3.1.88, by which the root ‘*tap*’ takes
the said augment and ending, when governing the noun ‘*tapas*.’

‘*Even though garlanded*.’—One who wears a garland is called
‘garlanded,’ *i.e*., the man who wears a string of flowers.

This epithet indicates the renouncing of the restraints imposed upon the
Religious Student. The meaning is that, even if one were to renounce the
duties of the Religious Student, and yet recite the Veda ‘*to the heat
of his capacity*,’—as much as he can do, even though that be
little,—‘*daily*’—every day,—he becomes endowed with excellent success.

This is mere praise; it does not moan that one should read the Veda
after renouncing the restraints.—(107)

*Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*, 11. 5. 7. 4.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 509), which adds
the following explanatory notes:—The meaning is that the man who, even
though wearing the garland,—*i.e*. though not observing the rules and
restrictions strictly,—sedulously carries on Vedic study, carries on
excellent austerity ‘to the very fingertips—the particle ‘*ha*’
indicates that the fact stated is universally recognised. Thus the sense
is that “when Vedic study, carried on without strict adherence to the
rules, is conducive to excellent results,—what to say of it, when done
in strict accordance with the rules.”

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 69), which gives the *Anvaya*
as—‘*ānakhāgrebhyaḥ tapastapyate ha*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 128), which explains the meaning as one who studies the Veda to the
best of his capacity performs the ‘highest austerity, to the very
finger-tips it adds the notes—‘*ha*’ indicates that what is stated here
is well-known,—‘*sragvī*’, wearing a garland, *i.e*. even though not
strictly observing the restraints and observances.

Some persons (as noted above) have explained the term ‘*entire*’ (of the
preceding verse) to include the Subsidiary Sciences; and according to
this view, it might be thought that the study of these might be taken up
in any order one might choose, without any restriction; hence the
present verse proceeds to lay down a definite order,—*viz*., the Veda
should be learnt first, then the Subsidiary Sciences. Others have
however taken the term ‘entire’ to preclude the possibility of men being
content with the learning of parts only of the Veda; and according to
these, the ‘learning of the Veda’ naturally comes up first, after the
completion of the ‘*Traividya*’ observances (of the *Upanayana*) so that
(what the present verse means is that) until the Veda has been learnt,
the learning. of the Sciences cannot be permitted.

‘*The twice-born man*’—Brāhmaṇa—‘*who, not having learnt the Veda,
labours*’;—*devotes attention*—‘*over* *other subjects*,’ *i.e*.,—the
Subsidiary Sciences, or treatises on Reasonings—‘*falls, even while
living, to the state of the Śūdra*’—‘*soon*’—quickly,—‘*along with his
descendants*’;—*i.e*., accompanied by his son, grandson and other
descendants.

‘*Labour*’—is great effort. Since the absolute prohibition of labour
over the study of the Sciences cannot be intended, all that is meant is
that these latter are to be studied during the time available, after the
Veda has been learnt.

The mention of ‘*falling to the state of the Śūdra*’ is meant to express
excessive deprecation.

The use of the term ‘*twice-born*’ implies that the restriction herein
laid down regarding the rules of study applies to only one who has gone
through the Initiatory Rites; and before Initiation, the study of such
Subsidiary Sciences as of Phonetics, Grammar, and the rest as are not
interspersed with quotations from the Veda, is not prohibited.

“The study of the Subsidiary Sciences is implied by the Injunction of
Vedic Study; and this injunction is acted up to by the boy prompted by
his Teacher; so that before Initiation, there being no Teacher, how can
there be a study of the Subsidiary Sciences?”

There is no force in this objection. According to the assertion—‘the
child who is taught by his father they call efficient’—the Initiatory
sanctification might be performed by the father; who, before the
Initiation, will teach him the Science of Grammar and the rest.—(168)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 510) as declaring
the omission of Vedic study to be sinful; and adds that this text lays
down *directly* the compulsory character of the study, which has been
already *indirectly* indicated by the injunction of the compulsory daily
duties: and the effect of this direct declaration comes to be this that
the omission of the study (as a compulsory duty) involves sin; specially
as for this omission special expiatory rites have been prescribed.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 49) as declaring that there
is sin in the omission of Vedic study, which is a duty duly enjoined. It
is interesting to note however that this assertion has come from the
*Pūrvapakṣin*, and the *Siddhānta* view put forward is that what this
verse is pointing to is only that ante-natal sin which is the cause of
the sloth to which the omission of the study and such other duties is
due; and it is added that what the due performance of the obligatory
duty does is either (1) to maintain the ‘absence of sin’ or (2) to
destroy the said ante-natal sin.

The same work quotes the verse again, on page 140, in support of the
view that Vedic study is an *obligatory* duty.

The same work quotes it again in its Prāyaścitta section (p. 15) as an
instance of what is meant for the *male* only.

The *Madanapārijāta* (p. 102) simply quotes it among a number of other
texts laying down the thorough study of the Veda.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 129) to the effect that
Vedic study should be the very first care of the twice-born.

‘*Mātuḥ*—from the mother;—‘*agre*’—first—‘*adhijananam*,’—birth, of man.

‘*The second*, *after the girdle-tying ceremony*’;—*i.e*., after the
*Upamyana*. The short vowel ‘*i*’ in the term ‘*mauñjibandhane*’ is
according to Pāṇini 6-3-63, by which there is much latitude given in
regard to vowels contained in proper names.

‘*The third*, *after sacrificial initiation*,’—such as the Jyotiṣṭoma
and the rest. This initiation also has been described as ‘birth’ in such
passages as—‘when the priests initiate the sacrificer, they bring about
a repetition of birth.’

These arc the three births of twice-born men, described in tho Veda.

“In that case the man becomes *thrice-born*.”

Let that be so; as a matter of fact, the Upanayana is the basis of the
name ‘twice-born’;—and it is on this name that the man’s title to the
performance of *Śrauta*, *Smārta* and conventional rites is based. Tho
mention of the first and third

‘births’ is simply for the purpose of eulogising the second one, which
is the best of all births; \[As regards the third birth\] it is only the
performance of sacrifices to which the uninitiated man is not entitled;
while the one who has not undergone the *Upanayana* ceremony is not
entitled to any religious act at all.

Others hold, that it is ‘Fire-kindling’ that is here spoken of as
‘sacrificial initiation,’ on the ground of its Leing the forerunner of
all sacrifices. That Fire-kindling also is regarded as a ‘birth’ is
shown by such passages as—‘he who does not kindle the fire is as good as
unborn.’—(169)

Hopkins is not quite accurate in his interjectory remark—“So the *twice*
-born has *three* births!” It is not every twice-born person that has
three births; the third ‘birth’ belongs to only that twice-born person
who is initiated for a sacrifice. Hopkins might as well exclaim in
connection with the next verse—“So the twice-born has two mothers and
two fathers!”

‘*Among these*’—above-mentioned births;—that which is ‘*Brahmic

*Muñja-grass*; at this ‘*Sāvitrī is his mother*,’—*i.e*., it becomes
accomplished by the expounding of the Sāvitrī-mantra. This shows that in
the whole Upanayana ceremony, the expounding of the *Sāvitrī* is the
most important factor; it is for this purpose that the child is ‘brought
near’ (*upa-nīyate*). ‘*The Teacher is his father*.’

Birth is always brought about by the Father and Mother; hence
metaphorically the Teacher and the Sāvitrī hare, been described as
‘father’ and ‘mother.’—(170)

tying the girdle that the Teacher is to be honoured like the father;
hence the next verse is added
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 335), as laying
down that the Upanayana constitutes the ‘*brahmajanma*,’ ‘brahmic’ or
‘Vedic’ ‘birth.’ The compound ‘*brahmajanma*’ is expounded as ‘*brahmaṇā
vedena gāyatrīrūpeṇa janma iva*,’—i. e. the rite which is like *birth*,
through the *Brahman* or *Veda*, in the form of *Gāyatṛī*;—*i.e*. it is
a rejuvenation brought about by the sanctificatory rite. The idea of
this being a ‘birth’ has been spoken of in the Śruti
also—‘*Gāyatryā-brāhmaṇamasṛjat tṛṣṭubhā rājanyam jagatyā vaiśyam na
kenachicchandasā śūdram*—That the term ‘*brahma*’ (in the compound
‘*brahmajanma*’) does not stand for the *whole Veda* is made clear by
the qualification ‘*mauñjībandhana-chihnitam*,’ ‘marked by the tying of
the girdle—this tying of the girdle being done immediately after the
imparting of the *Gāyatrī*, and not after the whole Veda has been taught
It goes on to add that this same fact has been stated by Medhātithi
negatively, in the passage ‘*tayāhi anuktayā tanna niṣpannam bhavati*,
(until the Gāyatrī has been imparted, the Upanayana is not
accomplished). \[This passage occurs on p. 153, 1. 22 of Medhātithi,
where however the reading found is *tanniṣpannambhavati* ‘It becomes
accomplished by the expounding of the *gāyatrī*’ (Translation, p. 459);
which is a *positive*, and not a *negative*, assertion, though the
meaning is the same in both cases\].—The conclusion therefore is that
the name ‘*Upanayana*’ pertains to the *imparting* *of the
Gāyatri-mantra*.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 59) as supplying the
reason for regarding *Upanayana* as a second ‘birth.’

‘*They call the teacher* “*Father*,” *on account of his imparting the*
*Veda*,’—*i.e*., On account of his teaching the entire Veda, not merely
of expounding the Sāvitrī. ‘*Imparting*’ stands for making the boy agree
to pronounce the words of the Veda.

“If it be as described here, then, until the teacher has acquired the
position of the father, the boy cannot obtain his second birth; and
until he has become ‘twice-born,’ he would be as unrestrained in his
conduct as he is prior to the Upanayana.”

In view of this difficulty the text adds—‘*before the tying of the
girdle for him*’—*no religious act*—any act, *Śrauta*, or *Smārta* or
*conventional*, for the acquiring of transcendental results,—is
performed; *i.e*., he is not entitled to perform any such act. In fact
it is only after his *Upanayana* that the boy becomes entitled to the
performance of the duties of his caste and of humanity.

“How could there be any question of the boy being entitled to the
performance of any such acts, when he is lacking in the requisite
knowledge (prior to Initiation and Vedic Study)?”

It is in view of this that it has been declared that “the pupil is to
his teacher both pupil to be taught and person to he helped in the
performance of sacrifices”; \[and while he is himself kicking in the
requisite knowledge\] he should be taught by his teacher (how to perform
the acts); as it has been said above (2.69)—‘The teacher should teach
him the rules of cleanliness and right conduct.’ Says Gautama also
(2.6)—‘The restraints begin with the Upanayana.’ The business of the
teacher extends up to the completion of Vedic Study.—(171)

The phrase ‘*till the tying of the girdle*’ has to be construed with
this verse; or the intended limit may be taken as supplied by the
commendatory statement contained in the second half—‘*so long as he is
not born in the* *Veda*.’

‘*Brahma*’—Vedic text—‘*he should not pronounce*.’ This is an
instruction to the father of the boy; the sense being that he should
guard the child from pronouncing Vedic texts in the same manner as ho
guards him from the drinking of wine and such other acts.

Some people interpret this prohibition of pronouncing Vedic texts to
indicate the propriety of learning the Subsidiary Sciences before
*Upanayana*. They further explain the causal affix (in
‘*abhivyāhārayet*’) to mean that the child should not be made by his
father to pronouce Vedic texts, there is no harm done if the child
himself pronounces a few indistinct words of the Veda.’

But this is not right; as we read in another *Smṛti*—‘He should not
*pronounce* Vedic texts’ (Gautama, 2.5). And in the following
commendatory statement also it is stated that ‘*he is equal to a
Śūdra,'* which means that the child pronouncing Vedic texts is just as
reprehensible as the Śūdra.

The term ‘*svadhā*’ stands for the food offered to Pitṛs; or, the term
may stand for the ‘rites performed in honour of Pitṛs’.; and the term
‘*svadhāninayana'* means ‘that mantra by means of which the said food is
offered or given’; *e.g*., such mantras as ‘*śundhantām pitaraḥ*’ and so
forth. With the exception of such mantras, the boy should not pronounce
any Vedic texts.

It is from this that we deduce the fact that the uninitiated boy should
offer to his father libations of water, the ‘*nava-śrāddha*’; etc. That
he is not entitled to the *Pārvana* and other *śrāddhas* follows from
the fact of his still being without the ‘Fire.’ These latter shall be
described under the section on ‘*Piṇḍānrāhāryaka* (?).’ We shall explain
all this in full detail in *Adhyāya III*.—(172)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (I, p. 24) in support of the view
that the uninitiated twice-born is like the Śūdra, and as such should
not pronounce Vedic mantras except in Śrāddha;—again in the same work,
on p. 795, to the same effect, where it adds the following
notes:—‘*svadḥā*’ is *śrāddha*’, and ‘*svadhāninayana*’ means ‘that
group of mantras by which the śrāddha is *accomplished*’ (‘*svadhā
śrāddham ninīyate yena mantrajātena*’);—barring this group of mantras,
he shall pronounce none other; in every other case the mantra would be
recited for him by a Brāhmaṇa.—The same work (II, p. 383) quotes the
verse again, in support of the view that the uninitiated boy also is
entitled to recite Vedic mantras at *śrāddhas*;—where ‘*abhivyāhārayet*’
is explained as ‘*vadet*’, *should pronounce*, the causal affix ‘*ṇich*’
being used reflexively.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 327) quotes the second line, in support of
the view that whenever the twice-born person is described as *having the
character of the Śūdra*, it is by reason of his being not entitled to
Vedic Study;—again on p. 348, where it is explained that ‘equality to
the Śūdra’ is a ground for the man’s not being entitled to rites
involving the use of Vedic mantras;—that this is so is indicated by the
particle ‘*hi*,’ (which means *because*)...... In fact whenever a
twice-born person is spoken of as being *like the Śūdra*, what is meant
is that he is not entitled to the performance of rites involving the use
of Vedic mantras.

It is quoted in *Vyāvahāra Bālambhaṭṭi*, (p. 656);—and in
*Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 23), as laying down the law for the uninitiated.

character, equal to the Śūdra.’

*Gautama* (2.4, 5, 9).—‘The boy may urinate or stool as he pleases; for
him there are no rules regarding water—sip-piug; he should not pronounce
Vedic texts, except at offerings to Pitṛs.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 327).—‘So long as the boy has
not been initiated there is no harm done if he does not observe rules
regarding what should or should not be eaten or what should or should
not be spoken or regarding lying.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra).—‘He may do and eat and say what

Verse 2.69 has laid down the order of sequence among Cleanliness, Right
Conduct and Vedic Study: and hence the Veda should be read in that same
order. The learning of the Veda having become possible after the
Initiatory Rite, the present verse serves to lay down the order in which
it is to be done. The boy, on being initiated, should keep the
‘*Traividya*’ and other observances; and then proceed to study the Veda.

‘*For the boy whose Initiatory rite has been performed*,’—*i.e*.,—for
tho Religious Student—‘*instruction reagarding obser* *vances is
considered desirable*,’—and is actually done by teachers. As a matter of
fact, it is on the strength of the scriptures that the said instruction
is ‘considered desirable’; hence the ‘desirability’ spoken of stands for
the ‘necessity of doing’ it.

After this instruction follows the ‘*getting up of the veda*,’—‘*in due
order*’—as here described ,—‘*according to the prescribed rule*.’—This
is a reiteration, for the purpose of filling up the metre.—(173)

‘*Vrata*’—‘The Vedic *vratas*, of the *Godāna* and the rest’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, and Rāghavānanda);—‘the observances and
restrictive rules, such as offering fuel, the prohibition of sleeping in
the day-time, and the like’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘Penances, like the
*Prājāpatya*’ (Nandana and Nārayāṇa).

over the staff, he should direct him to Religious Studentship—“Thou art
a Religious Student, sip water, do your duty, sleep not during the day,
study the Veda under the Teacher.”’

*Yājñavalkya* (2-15).—‘The Teacher, having initiated the boy, should
teach him the Veda preceded by the *mahāvyāhṛtis*, and instruct him
regarding cleanliness and conduct.’

*Gautama* (2-20).—‘The restrictions begin with the Upa nayana.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.2.11, 17-20).—‘On being initiated, the boy
should reside in the Teacher’s family, as a Religious Student; there is
no fasting for the Religious Student desirous of acquiring knowledge;
the rule for the Religious Student is that he should he entirely under
the Teacher, except as regards the committing of degrading sins; he
should he ever bent upon the good of the Teacher, never crossing him in
speech.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (4.13, 14, 16).—‘Morning and evening, he should
fetch a jar of water;—every day he should bring fuel from the forest and
keep it on the ground;—having kindled the fire and swept round it, he
should lay fuel on it, morning and evening, in accordance with the
instructions he receives.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (5.5).—‘He should do such acts as might be
pleasing to the Teacher.’

*Viṣṇu* (28.1).—‘For Religious Students, residence in the Teacher’s
house.’

*Viṣṇu* (2,14).—‘The offering of the two Twilight Prayers; and after
offering it, he should salute the Teacher.’

*Viṣṇu* (34-35).—‘Thus he should make his own either one Veda, or two
Vedas, or three Vedas; then the Vedic Subsidiaries.’

*Viṣṇu* (34-42).—‘After having made the Veda his own, he should obtain
the Teacher’s permission and offer him an excellent thing and then
bathe.’

*Viṣṇu* (19.1).—‘Him should one know as the *Teacher* who initiates him,
teaches him the observances and teaches tho Veda.’

*Gobhila Gṛhyasūtra* (2.20. 33-34).—‘Then he directs the boy—thou art a
Religious Student,—fetch fuel, sip water, do thy duty, sleep not during
the day.’

*Gobhila Gṛhyasūtra* (3. 4. 1).—‘The Religious Student should study the
Veda.’

*Gobhila Gṛhyasūtra* (1. 1. 7).—‘The Religious Student having studied
the Veda, should make the final offering of fuel on the fire.’

*Śaṅkha* (3.1-2).—‘Having initiated the pupil, the Teacher should first

The authors of Gṛhyasūtras have laid down certain acts called
‘observances’; such for instance as, ‘for one year one desires to get up
the Veda or a part of it,’—in which connection there are observances and
vows and restraints prescribed; when one of these observances has been
completed, and another is taken up, then all the rules and regulations
that have been prescribed in connection with the Upanayana have to be
followed.

“In that case how are the skin, etc., previously taken up to be disposed
of?”

They are to be thrown into the water.

“That has been declared to be the method of disposing of things
previously taken up; but of what form would be the disposal of such of
those things as might have been destroyed (or lost)?”

As regards cases of loss, in as much as each of the things has its use
definitely prescribed in the descriptions, it naturally follows that
when one is lost, it is replaced by another; and this taking up of the
latter would constitute the ‘disposal’ of the former.

‘*That* *skin*’ which has been prescribed for a particular Religious
Student, *e.g*., ‘the skin of the *Kṛṣṇa* deer for the Brāhmaṇa, that of
the *Ruru* deer for the *Kṣatriya* and so forth.

Similarly with the *staff* and other things.

All this stands ‘*during* *the observances, also*.’ In view of the
context, ‘observances’ here must he taken as standing for ‘instruction
regarding observances.’—(174)

The Author is going to set forth a set of restraints and observances, in
a section by themselves; and the present verse is intended to emphasise
the importance of these; the sense being that what has been said before
must be done, but what is coming next is even more important and
conducive to superior results.

The term ‘Religious Student’ has been added in order to preclude the
suspicion that a fresh section having begun here, the duties that are
going to bo described are not meant for the student.

“If the text is continuing to describe the duties of the Religious
Student, why should this be regards as a different section?”

Even though what are going to be described are similar in character to
those that have gone before, yet there is a certain superiority
attaching to them; and it is purely on the ground of this slight
distinction that their?tr?eatment has been regarded as forming a
different section.

The remaining words of the Text are explained as added for the purpose
of making up the verse.

‘*Should observe*,’—Should follow.

‘*These*’—Those going to be described. The pronoun ‘this’ always refers
to what happens to be uppermost in the mind.

‘*Living with his Teacher*’—for the purpose of acquiring learning. The
participle ‘*living*’ indicates permanent proximity.

‘*Having fully controlled his organs*’—in the manner described above.
(Verses 88—100.)

‘*With a view to enhancing piety*’;—*i.e*., for the purpose of that
embellishment of himself which is brought about by the proper observance
of the Injunction of Vedic Study.—(175)

verse.

*Laghvāśvalāyana Smṛti* (1.5).—‘The Religious Student, firm in his own
duty, should remain devoted to the service of the Teacher.’

*Laghvāśvālāyana Smṛti* (12.15-16).—‘Then he should make the student get
up the Veda on such days as are fit for study; being initiated, from
that day onwards for six months, he should serve the Teacher and study
the Veda in the prescribed manner.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (5.2-3).—‘Having studied either one Veda, or two Vedas, or
three Vedas,—his studentship unruffled, the Religious Student should
serve the Teacher.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (26.18-19).—‘As horses, without a chariot, or a chariot
without horses, so is Austerity without Knowledge, and Knowledge without
Austerity. Just as food mixed with honey, or honey mixed with food, is
wholesome, so also are Knowledge and Austerity united.’

*Gautama* (3.9.5).—‘Conducting himself thus, with senses subdued, he
reaches Brahmic regions.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.2,11,12,19,26).—‘After initiation, residence
in the Teacher’s house...... He should never have sexual intercourse.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (4. 23, 29).—‘He should every day safeguard the
interests of the Teacher by means of virtuous and prudent acts; the
Religious Student, with mind concentrated, should perform all useful
acts.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (5.1, 5, 9-11).—‘The term Austerity stands for
the Restrictions; he should perform such acts as may be pleasing to the
Teacher;—attentive to Vedic study, bent upon Dharma, fixed in austerity,
straightforward and merciful, thus does the Religious Student become
accomplished.’

*Viṣṇu* (27.47).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who carries on his studentship in this
manner goes to the highest place and is not born again.’

*Viṣṇu* (1.24).—‘Delighting in learning the Veda, living under the
Teacher, bent upon the Teacher’s good.’

*Vyāsasmṛti* (1.24).—‘Being initiated, he should reside in the Teacher’s
house, ever calm and collected; on a sacred day, having pronounced the
Praṇava and the Gāyatrī, he should begin the study of the Veda, also the
Dharmaśāstra, for the purpose of understanding cleanliness and conduct;
having duly read all this from the Teacher, he should act so as to
please him; in this manner should he keep the observances of his
studentship. He should ever attend upon him till he completes his Veda
study.’

*Nārada* (5.8-15).—‘Till he has mastered the sciences, the student shall
attend diligently on his Teacher; the same conduct has to be observed by
him towards the Teacher’s wife and son. He shall preserve chastity and
beg alms, lying on a low couch and using no ornaments. He shall go to
rest after, and rise before, all persons in the Teacher’s house. He
shall never come or stay without his Teacher’s bidding; his Teacher’s
call he must obey without hesitation, when he is able to do so. He shall
read at the proper time, when his Teacher is not averse to it, sitting
on a lower seat than his Teacher, by his side, or on a bench and paying
attention to what he says. Science, like the current of a stream, is
constantly advancing towards the plain; therefore one studying science
should be humble towards his Teacher. His Teacher shall correct him, if
he is not obedient, scolding him or chastising him with a rope or with a
small shoot of cane. The Teacher shall not strike him a heavy blow; nor
on the head or on the chest; and he must encourage him after having
chastised him. Otherwise the king shall punish the Teacher. After having
completed his studies, he shall give the customary present to his
Teacher and return home. Thus should be the conduct of the Student.’

Everyday, ‘*having bathed and become pure*,’—*i.e*., having his
uncleanliness removed by bath,—‘*he should make offerings to Deities,
Sages and Fathers*.’ If he is already clean, he need not bathe; as the
adding of the term ‘clean’ clearly shows that the ‘bathing’ here laid
down is only for the purpose of cleanliness, and hence its performance
is absolutely compulsory, like the ‘bathing’ to be done by the
*Snālaka*, Accomplished Student. It is for this reason that in another
*Smṛti* bathing has been prohibited (for the Religious Student); though
this prohibition refers to bathing with clay, for purposes of personal
adornment. Gautama however has prescribed actual bathing. Hence what is
meant is that one should plunge into water like a stick, and he should
remove dirt, etc., by rubbing the body with his hauds. Unless there is
touching of an unolean thing, such dirt as arises from perspiration, or
from contact with the dust contained in the clothing, etc., does not
make one ‘unclean’; for the presence of such dirt is inevitable. Says
the Brāhmaṇa—‘What is *dirt*? Is it the skin, or hairs of the beard or
penance?’—which shows that the presence of such ‘dirt’ is conducive to
spiritual merit.

“How is it known that the *bathing* (here laid down) is for the purposes
of cleanliness?”

The present injunction cannot be taken as prompting, to the performance
of divine service, a person who fulfills the two distinct qualifications
of ‘having bathed’ and ‘become clean’;

\(1\) because as a matter of fact, one who has bathed can never remain
unclean;

\(2\) because even for a person who has adopted cleanliness by having
sipped water, etc., bathing is found to be enjoined;

\(3\) because we meet with such passages as ‘having bathed, sipped
water, one should sip water again,’ where even for the person who has
bathed a method of further cleanliness is enjoined.

From all this it is clear that what the present verse enjoins is that
whenever occasion (in the shape of the contact of unclean things, etc.)
arises, one should bathe, even though there be already present the
‘cleanliness’ that is generally understood as such.

Or, the present verse may be regarded as a totally independent rule,
intended to prohibit bathing without special occasion arising in the
shape of uncleanliness; and it is iu view of this, prohibition that we
have the counter-exception—‘one should bathe after having learnt the
Veda,’—which enjoins bathing at the end of Vedic Study (even in the
absence of any uncleanlincss).

“*He should make offerings to Deities*, *Sages and Fathers*.”—By reason
of the mention of ‘*tarpaṇa*,’ the ‘offering’ here meant appears to be
that offering of water to the Deities and others which has been
prescribed among the duties of the house-holder, under 3.283. The
authors of *Gṛhyasūtras* also have declared this act as to be done, with
water only; *e.g*., says Āśvalāyana (3.1.3)—‘He satisfies the Deities.’
Inordinary life also this act is known as the ‘offering of water.’

The Deities to whom this offering is to be made have been enumerated by
the writers on Gṛhya—*vis*., Agni, Prajāpati, Brahmā and so forth. The
‘*tarpaṇa*,’ ‘offering,’ to these does not consist of producing in them
the feeling of satisfaction (which is the etymological meaning of the
term ‘*tarpaṇa*’); it consists only in the pouring, on their behalf, of
water with joined hands. Hence what is here laid down comes to be only a
sacrificial offering, in which water is the substance offered. Specially
as the character of ‘deity’ could not otherwise have belonged to those
to whom the offering is made; for that alone has been called ‘deity’ to
whom a sacrifice is offered; it is not one who *becomes satisfied*. The
only definition of ‘deity’ that we have is—‘Deities are recipients of
hymns and recipients of offerings’; they become ‘recipients of hymns’ by
becoming the objects of eulogy, and they become ‘recipients of
offerings’ by becoming those to whom offerings are made. When therefore
our author speaks of them as ‘*tarpya*,’ ‘to be satisfied,’ he uses the
term in its figurative sense of ‘being recipients of the offering of
water.’ The teacher and such other persons are recognised as
‘recipients’ when the cow and such things are transferred to their
ownership; and the Deities also are ‘recipients.’ Thus both having the
common character of ‘being recipients,’ they are described as ‘being
satisfied.’ If what is laid down here meant actual ‘satisfying’ of the
Deities, then this^(:) water-offering’ would become a purely
sanctificatory act; and yet no ‘Sanctification’ is possible in the case
of Deities; for the simple reason that they have not been, nor are they
ever likely to lie, employed; and what has never been employed, or is
not likely to be employed, cannot rightly be regarded as an object of
sanctification.

‘*Sages*,’—*i.e*., those sages that happen to be one’s ‘*Gotra-ṛṣis*’;
*e.g*., for those belonging to the ‘Parāśara-gotra,’ Vaśiṣṭha, Śakti and
Pārāśarya would be the ‘sages’ (to whom the offering is to be made). The
author of *Gṛhyasūtras* have however spoken of the ‘seers of Vedic
Mantras’ (and not the *Gotra-ṛṣis*) as the ‘sages’ to whom the offering
is to be made; *i.e*., the sages Madhucchandas, Gṛtsamada and
Viśvāmitra. Since the text speaks of ‘sages’ without any qualification,
it is open to us to take it as standing for both kinds of sages; but in
view of the fact that the Gṛhyasūtras have specified them (as being the
‘seers of mantras’), it is only right to take these latter as meant.

‘*Fathers*.’—One’s dead ancestors,—father, grandfather, etc., all
*Sapiṇḍas* and *Samānodakas*. In the case of the ‘Fathers,’ the
‘offering’ is to be the actual ‘*Tarpaṇa*’ itself. This is going to be
distinctly laid down under the rules bearing upon *Śrāddha*.

*Worshiping of the Deities*.—In connection with this some ancient
writers have made the following observations:—“Who are these deities,
whose ‘worship’ is here laid down? If they are meant to be those pninted
in picture-books—figures with four arms, with a thunderbolt in the hand
and so forth,—then, since ordinary men regard these as ‘images’ (which
connotes *unreality*), they can be called ‘Deity,’ only figuratively.
If, on the other hand, they are meant to be those related to hymns and
offerings,—which are indicated by Vedic injunctions, and also by the
words of mantras, and which are called so by persons versed in the use
of words and their denotations,—such as ‘Agni,’ ‘Agni-Soma,’
‘Mitra-Varuṇa,’ ‘Indra,’ ‘Viṣṇu,’ and so forth—then, in that case, their
character of ‘Deity,’ would be dependent upon the said acts (of
offering, etc.), and not upon the fact of their having any connection
with the denotation (of the term ‘Deity’); and further, a particular
(Deity) would be the ‘Deity’ for only that offering which is enjoined as
to be offered to him; *e.g*., when the ‘Cake baked upon eight pans,’ is
called ‘*āgneya*’ (dedicated to Agni), Agni becomes the ‘deity’ only of
that cake, and not of that which is called ‘*saurya*’ (dedicated to
Sūrya).”

From the above considerations the conclusion that the ancient writers
have deduced is as follows:—In cases where the term cannot be. taken in
its direct denotation, it is only right to take it in the figurative
sense; specially as such is the actual usage. Hence the ‘worship’
enjoined in the present verse is that of *images*.

What the truth on this point is we shall explain below, under verse 189.

‘*Madhu*’—stands for the *honey* produced by bees. As for *wine* (which
also is called ‘madhu’), it is an intoxicant; and hence its use is
prohibited even before the Upanayana: ‘The Brāhmaṇa should ever abstain
from intoxicants’—says Gautama (2.20).

‘*Meat*,’—even such as has been offered (to deities And fathers).

The term ‘*scent*’ stands for camphor and such other things as are of
extremely sweet scent,—the name of the quality (scent) being used
figuratively for things possessed of it. All highly perfumed substances
are prohibited, and what is prohibited is the applying of these perfumes
to the body; as for the scent itself, when it proceeds from the fragrant
substance, it cannot, be checked. Nor does the prohibition apply to the
case where the perfume reaches the student by chance. What is
reprehensible therefore is the intentional using of fragrant incense and
such things as luxury. It is for this reason that there.is nothing
reprehensible in the case where the pupil is told by his Teacher to cut
a Sandal-tree and the sweet smell of the wood reaches him it its natural
way. It Is by reason of its being mentioned along with ‘garland’ that we
take it to mean *strong scent*. That which is not strong enough to
exhilarate the mind,—*e.g*., the smell of such things as *Kuṣṭha, Ghṛta,
Pūtidāru*, etc.—is not prohibited.

‘*Garland*’—flowers strung together.

‘*Flavours*’—Sweet, acid and the rest.

“Since things absolutely devoid of flavour could not be eaten, living
itself would be impossible (if one were to avoid all flavours).”

True; but what are prohibited are highly tasty things, like sugar. This
prohibition applies also to such substances as are mixed with other
things, by way of condiments. Or, the prohibition may apply to too much
indulgence in too richly cooked and tasty food. To the same end we have
the following saying—‘He alone acquires learning who shuns wealth like
serpent, sweets like poison and women like demonesses.’

Others explain ‘*rasa*,’ ‘*flavour*,’ to stand for the poetic emotions,
Erotic and the rest; the sense being that one should not arouse his
emotions by witnessing dramatic performances or listening to poetical
recitations.

Others again have held the view that the prohibition applies to the
pieces of sugar-cane, *Dhātri* and such other substances, when extracted
and separated from them,—and not as contained within them.

This however is not right; the term ‘*rasa*’ is not known as symonymous
with ‘fluid.’

As a matter of fact, what is prohibited with regard to each of the
things named is its enjoyment, in whatever form this may be possible.
For instance, of honey and meat, what is prohibited is the *eating*, and
not the seeing or touching; of scent and garland, what is prohibited is
using them with the idea of adorning the body, and not merely holding
them by the hand; similarly in the case of women, it is sexual
intercourse that is prohibited; and it is by reason of there being a
fear of such’intercourse following that the author is going to prohibit
later on, the looking at, and touching of, women. As says Gautama
(2.16)—‘The looking at, and touching of women (are reprehensible), for
fear of its leading to actual intercourse.’

‘*Fermented acids*’—such things as turn acid; that is those that turn
acid either by being kept overnight, or by being mixed with other
substances. Such substances are prohibited by reason of the avoiding of
these being among the duties of all twice-born persons; and yet it has
been re-iterated here for the purpose of including all those things that
are named ‘acid’ only figuratively; it is thus that ‘harsh words’ become
prohibited. Says Gautama—‘Acid words (should be avoided).’ It is for the
purpose of including all this that the author has added the epithet
‘all.’ This epithet ‘all’ is meant to refer to ‘flavours’ and ‘acids.’
It is thus that the figurative use becomes established.

Some people offer the following explanation:—“The term ‘acid’ prohibits
the acid flavours, and the term ‘all’ prohibits unpleasant words.”

These people should be asked the following question:—Why cannot the
epithet ‘all’ be taken as prohibiting those things that are prohibited
only by implication r In this way we could obtain the prohibition of
curds and like things which have turned acid. If however the prohibition
(by ‘all’) be explained as referring to things whose use is
possible,—then there can be no objection to it.

‘*Of living creatures*,’—such as insects and fleas; the killing of these
is done through childishness; hence we have the present prohibition with
a view to emphasise the necessity of making special efforts to avoid it.
Or, the re-iteration of the prohibition may be meant to be indicative of
the fact that the avoidance of killing is auxiliary to ‘Vedic Study.’ So
that the *killing* would involve the transgression, not only of the
prohibition calculated for the benefit of the agent, but also that of
the due observance of the injunction of Vedic Study.

“Why is not the same assumption made regarding the *fermented acids* and
other things also?”

The prohibition of the *acids*, etc., is such as has room for it in
other cases also \[ *e.g*. Harsh words are prohibited for other people
and under other circumstances also; the prohibition of killing has no
such room for application, since it is necessary during sacrificial
performances\]. And when between two things it is found that one becomes
absolutely null and void, while there is still room for the other, then
preference is given to the former.—(177)

notes one‘other’ explanation, *juices of sugar-cane, tamarind and other

‘*Rasān*’ stands for the juices of sugar-cane and other things;—even
though *Honey* also is a juice, yet it has been mentioned separately in
view of the heavier expiatory rites prescribed for the transgressors of
the rule prohibiting it.

‘*Anointing*’—rubbing of the head and body with butter, oil or such
other oily substances.

‘*Applying collyrium to the eyes*—the addition of the word ‘eyes’ is
only for the purpose of filling up the metre.

What is prohibited in regard to these two is the having recourse to them
by way of ornamentation; and not their use as medicine. That this is so
is. dear from their being mentioned along with ‘scents and garlands.’

‘*Shoes*’—foot-covers *made of leather*; not all kinds of foot-cover.

‘*Holding of the umbrella*’—either by one’s own hand or by the hand of
another person; both are prohibited.

‘*Kāma*’ here stands for *attachment*; the preclusion of *sexual desire*
being already included under the prohibition of association with women
(in 177).

‘*Anger*’—rage.

‘*Avarice*’—selfishness. Notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are the
characteristics of the mind.

‘*Dancing*.’—The throwing about of one’s limbs for the delectation of
ordinary people, as also the acting of dramas according to the rules
laid down by Bharata and others.

‘*Singing*’—the exhibition of the ‘Ṣaḍja’ and other musical notes.

‘*Playing upon musical instruments,'*—the producing of musical sounds by
means of the lute, the flute and so forth, as also the striking, to
time, of such instruments as the drum, *mṛdaṅga* and the like.—(178)

‘*Gambling*;’—playing with dice. Cock-fighting, etc., are also
prohibited by this,—the term ‘gambling’ being used in its most general
sense.

‘*Quarelling with people*’;—wordy dispute, without any reason, on common
matters; or asking people at random for news.

‘*Calumniating*.’—Recounting the defects of other people through sheer
ill-will.

‘*Lying*’—describing things otherwise than what is actually seen or
heard.

Every one of these words has the Accusative ending, on account of its
being governed by the verb ‘should abstain from’ (in the preceding
verse).

‘*The gazing at and touching of women*’;—‘*gazing at*’ means looking
intently with a view to observe the shape of limbs; ‘this part of her
body is beautiful—that is not so,’and so forth.

‘*Touching*’ stands for *embracing*. These two are prohibited for fear
of their leading up to sexual intercourse; and this is to be applied to
the case of the young boy in some way or other.

‘*Injuring of others*,’—*i.e*., doing harm; obstructing the fulfilment
of some purpose. For instance, if he is questioned on matters relating
to the marriage of girls, he should not say that a certain bridegroom is
unfit, even if he be really so; he should remain quiet (say nothing), as
lying has been prohibited.—(179)

This is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 456);—in *Madanapārijāta*

When one renounces his vow of continence intentionally, then he has to
perform the expiatory rite prescribed for the ‘*Avakīrṇī*’ (11.120 *et.
seq*.); the present verse lays down what one should do when he does it
unintentionally.

No significance attaches to the mention of ‘dream’; the *absence of
intention* is the only necessary condition; and no intention can be
present during dreams. Hence this same expiatory rite is to be performed
in a case where, even though he may be not asleep, the flow occurs
involuntarily, in the same manner as certain other fluids flow out of
the body.

The sense of the verse thus is that—‘if one drops his manhood
unintentionally, he should perform this expiatory rite that he should
recite the three verses, etc., etc.—(181)

He should fetch as much of water in jars and other things as might serve
the purposes of the Teacher.

This is only by way of illustration; the meaning being that he should do
other household-work also,—all that is not absolutely demeaning. What
this verse is meant to indicate is that the pupil should not be made to
do any demeaning work,—such as touching the utensils in which food has
been eaten by persons other than the Teacher himself. For as regards the
Teacher himself, his service has been already prescribed in a general
way.

The compound ‘*yāvadarthāni*’ is to be expounded as ‘*yāvān arthaḥ
eṣām*.’

‘*Day by day he should beg for alms*’;—‘alms’ here stands for a very
small quantity of *cooked*, just enough for sustenance. It would not be
right to argue that it stands for *food in general* (not necessarily
*cooked*); since the generic term ‘*anna*’ (food) is found to be used in
the prohibition coming later on (in 188) regarding ‘the *food* of one
person’; because in view of the injunction ‘having collected the alms,
he should present it to the Teacher and then eat it,’ where the
*bringing* and *eating* are mentioned together, it is clear that
*cooked* food is meant; if dry grains had been brought in, how could
they be eaten forthwith? If the grain were collected and then cooked in
the Teacher’s house, the food thus cooked would be one that has the
*alms* for its source, it would not be the *aims* itself. In common
usage also it is *cooked food* that is called ‘alms.’

‘*Day by day*.’—“The daily *begging for alms* is already implied in what
follows later on (in 188)—‘He should live every day on alms.’

In 188, the term ‘every day’ has been added for the purpose of laying
down the means of subsistence; while the term ‘day by day’ in the
present verse is meant to preclude the possibility of some one keeping
the food mixed with butter, etc., overnight and then eating it next day;
the sense being that he should beg for alms and eat it *day by day*; and
he should never beg on one day and then, having kept it over-night, eat
it next day after mixing it with butter, etc—(182)

The Author next mentions the persons from whom the alms are to be
begged.

‘*Who are not devoid of Veda and sacrifices*—who are equipped with Vedic
learning, and perform the sacrifices to which they are entitled;—‘*not

performance of sacrifices, but who are accustomed to meritorious acts.
Or, those persons may be called ‘*for their deeds*’ who are content with
their own means of livelihood, and do not go in for such means of living
as usury and the like.

‘*From the houses of*’ these people ‘*he should fetch alms*’—*i.e*., beg

Even though the Teacher’s family may fulfil the aforesaid conditions,
yet ‘he should not beg for food’ from that family. ‘*Kula*,’ ‘*family*,’
stands for ‘relations’; hence one should not receive alms from the uncle
and other relations of the Teacher.

‘*Paternal relations*’—from the family of those related to the student
on his father’s side.—‘*From his maternal relations*’—*i.e*., from his
maternal uncle and others.

This verse should not be construed in such a way as to connect the words
‘paternal relations, etc.,’ with the *Teacher*; since the Teacher’s
relations have all been included under the term ‘*Teacher’s family*.’

“From whom then is he to beg for food?”

From houses other than those here mentioned.

‘*When other houses are not available*’—*i.e*., not possible;—when, for
instance, the entire village is inhabited either by the Teacher’s
family, or by his own paternal and maternal relations; and there are no
other families;—or even though they are there, they do not give him
alms;—then the student may beg from those just mentioned; when, others
are uot available, he should first beg from his maternal relations; if
these latter be not available, then from his paternal relations; and
when even these arc not available, then from the Teacher’s family.—(184)

The term ‘*distance*’ is meant to stand for such plots of land as are
not owned by any one; for instance, the forest is ‘distant’ from the
village, and it is not owned by any one. If such were not the meaning,
and ‘distance’ simply meant ‘remote places,’—then since the exact degree
of remoteness is not specified, the manning of the injunction would
remain indefinite.

‘*Having fetched*’—having brought.

‘*Should place*’—should keep.

‘*In the air*’—*i.e*., on the roof of the house; no placing is possible
in the open air, without some support.

‘*With* *these* *he should make offerings morning and evening*.’

The fetching of the fuel may he at that or at any other time, according
as the student pleases.

Some people regard the ‘placing in the air’ as serving some
transcendental purpose. Others have however held that the fuel brought
fresh from the tree is wet; and hence it is necessary to place it either
on the top of the house or on that of a wall, etc. (for the purpose of
drying).—(186)

desirous of food; dry, if desirous of Brahmic glory; both, if desirous

in the absence of that, Khadira or Śamī or Rohitaka or Aśvattha; and in

‘*He who, for seven days*’—consecutively, ‘*has omitted to beg alms and
to offer fuel to the Fire,—without being ill*’—while not suffering from
any disease,—‘*shall perform the rites prescribed for the
Anakīrṇin*’;—*i.e*., the expiatory rite the exact form of which is going
to he described in Chap. 11?. (verse 118).

This is said here only for the purpose of showing the gravity of the
offence; and it does not mean that the rite mentioned is to he actually
performed in expiation of the omission. That this is so is shown by the
fact that another *Smṛti* has laid down a much simpler expiation for
this omission, *viz*.: ‘offering of clarified butter, etc.’ The
following fact also is another indicative of the same conclusion:—If
what is mentioned here were a real expiatory rite, then on the occasion
of mentioning the conditions under which the ‘*Amkīrṇin-rite*’ are to be
performed as an expiatory rite, the author would have mentioned these
omissions also, in the same way in which he has mentioned ‘sexual
intercourse with women.’

Some people interpret this verse to means as follows:—“It is necessary
to do the two acts (of begging alms and offering fuel) for seven days
only; having done them for seven days, if one drops them, there is no
harm in this; and these seven days are to be the first ones after
Upanayana.”

This however is not right; as it would lie in direct contravention to
the direction that ‘this should be done till the Final Return from the
teacher’s house,’—as also to what follows in the next verse.—(187)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 438) as
laying down the *Avakīrṇivrata* (actually prescribed in 11.118 in
connection with the loss of chastity on the part of the Student) as
applicable to other omissions also;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p.
485), in support of the view that the Begging of Alms is not optional,
but compulsory, since the present verse prescribes an expiation for its
omission, which clearly implies that the omission is sinful;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498) to the effect that the omission of Begging
alms involves sin; and again on page 500, where it is explained that the
expiation here prescribed is to be performed in the event of repeated
omissions;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 1345, on 3. 281), where it is
explained as laying down an expiation for those cases where the duty of
‘fire-tending’ is omitted without any such extenuating circumstance as
being occupied with some other duty.

*Nirṇayosindhu* (p. 190) quotes it as laying down the expiatory rites
due on the omission of the duties laid down for the Student.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1142) as laying down the expiation for
omitting the said duties, without sufficient reason;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 111) to the effect that alms-begging is an obligatory
duty;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 357).

*Objection*.—“It has already been laid down that he should go about
begging alms every day (183).”

What is there said would show that the begging of Alms is meant to serve
the visible purpose (of sustaining the body); specially as it has been
subsequently laid down that ‘having offered it to the Teacher, he should
eat it’; and this ‘*eating*’ cannot be sanctificatory of the alms; which
alone could prevent us from taking it as serving the purely visible
purpose of sustaining the body.

Some people have explained that the re-iteration of the ‘daily begging
of alms’ is made for the purpose of adding the further direction that
‘he should not eat the food given by one person.’

But this is not right. Since the eating of the food given by one person
is precluded by the term ‘alms’ itself. ‘Alms’ stands for *an aggregate
of what is obtained* *by* *begging*; whence then could there be any
possibility of eating the food given by one person?

The conclusion on this point is that the whole rule has been re-iterated
here with a view to adding (in the next verse) that such eating of the
food given by one person is permissible at *Śrāddhas*.

‘*He should subsist on alms*’;—he should nourish his body—sustain his
life—by means of food obtained by begging; and he should not eat food
received from a single person.

The verse should not be taken to mean that “he should not eat what
belongs to a single person,—he should eat what belongs to several
owners; *e.g*., what belongs to several undivided brothers.” For the
word in the text means simply ‘one who eats one food—or one person’s
food.’

The term ‘*Vrati*’ here stands for the Religious Student; and as the
fact of the rule pertaining to him is clear from the context, the
addition of the word can be taken only as filing up the metre.

Next follows the commendatory statement:—‘The subsisting—sustaining of
the body—of the student on alms only has been declared to be equal to
fasting.’—(188)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
454) in support of the view that the Student should not accept food from
one and the same house day after day; and adds that this is meant to
apply to normal times; in abnormal times it is not meant to be strictly
adhered to; this on the strength of Yājñavalkya’s declaration (1. 32.)

The same work quotes the second half of the verse on p. 485, as
declaring the reward accruing to the Student from strictly following the
rules of alms-begging.

The whole verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498) as prohibiting
the habit of seeking for food from one and the same person regularly;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 61);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 111),
which says that this refers to *normal* times, not to abnormal times of
distress.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse provides an exception, under certain conditions, to the rules
regarding subsisting on alms.

‘*In honour of Gods*’;—*i.e*., when Brāhmaṇas are fed in honour of the
gods; and also when they are fed in honour of the fathers;—if he is
‘*incited*,’ requested—‘*he may eat freely*’—the food given by one
person. But he himself should not ask for it.

This again should be ‘*in due accordance with his observances*’; *i.e*.,
he should avoid honey and meat, which are inconsistent with his
observances. The two phrases—‘in *due accordance with his observances*’
and ‘*like an ascetic*’—express the same meaning; and it does not mean
that in a village he is to eat ‘in accordance with his observances,’
while in the forest he is to eat ‘like an ascetic.’ It is with a view to
filling up the metre that the two phrases have been used. \[There is
another reason why the phrase ‘*like an ascetic*’ should not he taken
separately\]—‘Ascetic’ here stands for the *hermit*, so if the student
were permitted to eat ‘like the hermit,’ the eating of meat also would
become allowed for him; as the hermit is permitted to eat meat, by such
rules as ‘he may eat the flesh of dead animals’ (Gautama, 3.31).

‘*In honour of Gods*’;—*i.e*., those rites of which gods are the
deities; *i.e*., the feeding of Brāhmaṇas laid down as to be done at the
performance of the *Agnihotra*, the *Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa* and the other
sacrifices offered to the gods; as we find in such injunctions as ‘at
the Āgrahāyaṇa and other sacrifices one should feed Brāhmaṇas and make
them pronounce “*svasti*.”’ It is in connection with these that we have
the present permission for the religious student.

Others explain the term ‘*performance in honour of the gods*’ to mean
that feeding of Brāhmaṇas which is done in honour of the Sun-god on the
seventh day of the month, and so forth.

This however is not right. For the act of *eating* has no connection
with the gods,—being, as it is, not instrumental in the accomplishment
of any sacrifice. Further, the mere fact of an act being done with
reference to a god, does not make the latter the ‘deity’ of that act; if
it did, then the Teacher would have to be regarded as the ‘deity’ when
one gives a cow to him, and the room will have to be regarded as the
‘deity’ when one sweeps it. Then again, it is with the *eater* that the
act of *eating* is directly connected; and the Sun-god has no active
function in the fulfilment of that act (as the Teacher is in the former
case); nor is he the thing aimed at (as the room is in the latter case);
as the eating is not for his sake. Further, the accusative ending (in
the term denoting *food*) denotes that it is meant for the eater, not
that it is meant for the Sun-god. Nor has it been enjoined anywhere that
‘one should feed Brāhmaṇas for the sake of (with reference to) the
Sun-god.’

It might be argued that on the basis of usage we assume the existence of
such an injunction.

But this cannot be; because there is always some scriptural basis found
for such assumption of injunctions.

“In the present case also we have such basis in the shape of the
‘external’ *Smṛtis*.”

If there were such a Smṛti-rule, its meaning would be that ‘one should
please the gods by feeding Brāhmaṇas.’ And it would not be right to
assume such a meaning; as scriptural injunctions are aimed, not at
*pleasin the Gods*, but at accomplishing what is prescribed by the
injunctions. Then again, if such were the meaning of the Injunction, its
connection with the Sun-god and others intended to be deities could not
be based either upon an object, or upon a desired result; nor again
could they be the purpose, as in the case of the act of piercing; nor
are they desired for their own sake, like cattle and other desirable
things, for the simple reason that they are not something to be enjoyed.
If it were the *satisfaction* of the Sun-god that were desired,—that
also, will need a proof for its own existence; and there is no such
proof available. Such a thing as the ‘satisfaction of the Sun-god’ is
not known by Perception or other means of knowledge,—in the way that
cattle, etc., are,—whereby it could be desired and connected with the
performance of sacrifices.

If the motive of the man be held to be the idea that “the Sun-god is my
lord and he will endow me with a fruit desired by me”;—this also cannot
be accepted, as there is no proof for this either. There is no
Injunction in support of this idea. It is only an Injunction that
prompts to activity the person who is related to a certain well-known
result, which also serves to single out the man so prompted; but it does
not point to the presence of the result. What the Injunction points to
is the fact that a certain act known by other means of knowledge as
leading to a particular desirable result is related to the performance
as his qualifying factor.

If it be held that the offering is a kind of ‘sacrifice,’ and the
*feeding* is a kind of *disposal* of it,—our answer is that that may be
so regarded, if such is the usage of cultured people. But the feeding
cannot be shown to have any direct connection with the deity; and as for
connection through the intervening agency of the *sacrife*, that we do
not object to. Then again, as a matter of fact, when people undertake
the performance of such acts, they have no idea that they are performing
a *sacrifice*; the only idea that they have is that when the Brāhmaṇas
have been fed, the particular deity would be satisfied. From all this it
is clear that the Deity has no sort of action conducive to the act of
feeding, nor is it the qualifying factor of any other thing that has
such action. Thus then, the Deity is neither the object of the act, nor
has it any connection with it. Nor again is it possible for the Sun-god
and the rest to be regarded ns *aimed at* by the act; for in the act of
*feeding*, it is the person *fed* that is aimed at; and it is the
Brāhmaṇas that are fed. Further, the mere fact of being *aimed at* does
not make one the ‘deity’; for in that case, when one gives a cow to the
Teacher, or sweeps the room, the Teacher and the room would have to be
regarded as ‘deities.’

“How then is there to be Brāhmaṇa-feeding at a performance in honour of
ancestors? There also the fathers could not be the ‘deities’ of the act.
The offerings made into the Fire could not be regarded as made in honour
of the ancestor; as other deities are found to be mentioned in
connection with them. And just as the ‘satisfaction of the Sun-god,’ so
the ‘satisfaction of ancestors also, cannot be regarded as the result to
be accomplished, by the act; for the very same reason that the
connection of such satisfaction with the Injunction is not cognisable by
any other means of knowledge.”

To this some people make the following answer:—The ‘satisfaction of
Ancestors’ is clearly recognised (as the result to be accomplished).
That such beings as the ‘Fathers’ do exist is proved by the fact of
souls being imperishable; and it is only through their deeds that they
become connected with physical bodies. The feeding of these ‘Ancestors’
is the principal business, of which the reward has been described in the
passage—‘feeding them, one obtains ample reward.’ This reward could only
consist in the satisfaction of the Ancestors; this ‘satisfaction’ again
could only be in the form of happiness, mental contentment; it could not
be in the form of physical gratification which follows, in the case of
men, from the act of *eating*. This pleasure may sometimes accrue to the
fathers during the different conditions of life in which they happen to
be born under the influence of their own past deeds. The verbal root
‘*tṛp*’ denotes only *satisfaction*; physical gratification is something
different, and can be known only by other means of knowledge.

Against this the following objection might be raised:—“In as much as the
Son is the nominative agent in the act of feeding, how could the result,
which should accrue to the agent, accrue to the Ancestors,—as people
versed in law do not regard actions as bringing rewards to persons other
than the actual doers.”

Such an objection cannot be rightly taken. Because in this case the
Ancestors themselves are the accredited agents; by the mere act of
begetting the child, the father has done all this (that the son does on
his behalf); in fact the son is begot for the sole purpose that he will
confer on the Father benefits, seen as well as unseen. Tims then, just
as in the *Sarvasvāra* sacrifice—where the performer offers his own life
and is thus absent when the subsequent details are performed,—some other
persons continue to be regarded as the ‘performer,’ by virtue of his
having died after having requested the Brāhmaṇas to finish the sacrifice
for him, by means of the words

‘O Brāhmaṇas, please finish the sacrifice for me’;—so would it also be
in the case in question. The only difference between the two cases is
tbat in the case of the *Sarvasvāra*, the actual doers are the hired
priests doing the act with the totally different motive of earning a
living, while in the case in question the doer is the son, who has been
prompted by tbat same Injunction. Just as the Father performs the
sacraments *for his son*, being prompted to it by the Injunction of
*begetting sons*, which Injunction extends up to the final admonition
addressed to the son (after Upanayana),—similarly the *Śrāddha* and
other rites are performed, *for the father* by the son. Just as the
maintaining of the living father is a necessary duty of the son, as laid
down in (11.10A), so is it with the dead father also.

The performance of the act in question is not purely voluntary, like the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice, in connection with which we read—‘On the birth
of a son, one should offer the Vaiśvānara cake baked on twelve pans;—he
upon whose birth this offering is made becomes glorious, an enjoyer of
food and endowed with efficient organs.’ Here we find that the Father
comes to perform the Yaiśvānara sacrifice when he desires certain
results for his son; and it is not compulsory, like the Tonsure and
other sacramental rites. As regards the act under consideration, on the
other hand, we have the direction that ‘the rite in honour of the
Fathers should he performed till one’s death,’ which shows that the rite
is to be performed throughout one’s life.

As regards the objection that the result of the act, according to this
view, does not accrue to the doer of the act,—this is explained in a
different manner: just as in the case of the Vaiśvānara sacrifice, the
result, in the shape of having a highly qualified son, accrues to the
father, who is the doer of the act,—so in the case in question also, the
result, in the shape of the ‘Father’s satisfaction,’ accrues to the son,
the doer of the act. So that in both ways—whether the result accrue to
the father or to the performer of the rite,—there is no incongruity at
all. For as regards the father also, a result like the one in question
is one that is desired by him in the very act of begetting the child; so
that the father also does not obtain a reward not desired by him.

“If the ancestors are not the ‘deities’ of the Śrāddha-rite, how can it
be called ‘*paitra*’ (in honour of ancestors), which term has been
formed by the adding of the affix denoting the *deity*?’”

What we say in answer to this is that the Fathers are regarded as
deities on the ground of their being, like deities, the entities with
reference to whom the offerings are made. The ancestors are referred to
in some such form as ‘this feeding of Brāhmaṇas is done for the purpose
of benefiting you.’ In the offering called the ‘*Piṇḍapitṝ-Yajña*,’ the
ancestors are actually ‘deities but of *śrāddhas*, the ancestors have
not been regarded as ‘deities.’ As for this feeding of Brāhmaṇas, it is
on the same footing as the offerings tbat are made into the fire of
portions of clarified butter, cake and such other things. And in this
way the Brāhmaṇas themselves occupy the position of ancestors. Hence at
the time that the food is served to them, one should think of it being
offered to his ancestors, with some such expression in his mind—‘this is
offered to you, it is no longer mine.’ The Brāhmaṇas thus fed attain the
position of the ‘*Āhavanīya* fire’ (into which libations are poured);
the only difference being that into the Āhavanīya the offering is
actually thrown, while it is only placed near the Brāhmaṇas, and they
take it up themselves.

Nor will it be right to argue that “*Śrāddhas* cannot be regarded as
*sacrifice*, as in them the syllable ‘*svāhā*’ is not pronounced with
reference to the gods.” Because we find the same in the case of the
‘*Sviṣṭakṛt*’ offerings (which are regarded as sacrifice). Thus then,
the *Śrādḍha*, even though of the nature of a ‘sacrifice,’ can be
offered to Ancestors. Nor is there any incongruity in the Ancestors
being the ‘deities’ (of the offering) and also the recipients of the
result. We are going to explain more about this matter, which is not
directly mentioned in the text, under Chapter III.

From all this it becomes established that the Sun and the other gods arc
not ‘deities’ in the feeding of Brāhmaṇas.

“The definition of ‘deity’ as *one who is aimed at in a sacrifice* is
too narrow; because as a matter of fact, we find the name ‘deity’
applied even in cases where there is no connection with any sacrifice;
*e.g*., in such statements as—(*a*) ‘the worshipping of deities,’ ‘one
should approach the deities.’ But neither *worship*, nor *going forward*
(which is what is expressed by *approaching*), is possible with regard
to deities.”

There is no force in this; as the *worship* may be taken as enjoined in
connection with those cases where the deity is actually enjoined; or, it
may refer to the deities as related to the Agnihotra and other
sacrifices.

“Even so, the difficulty does not cease. The deity can never be the
*object of worship*; as that would deprive it of the very character of
‘Deity’ (which has been defined as consisting in being *aimed at in a
sacrifice*); for if it were the *object of worship*, it could not be the
*recipient of the sacrifice*. It h as been declared that ‘the active
agent of one act cannot be an active agent of another.’ The ‘active
agent’ is a particular kind of force, and this force varies with each
particular act; and as the presence of such force can be indicated only
by its effects, we can reasonably assume only that much of diversity in
it as there may be effects. From this it follows that what is the
‘recipient of a gift’ must remain the *recipient*, it cannot become the
*object*.—‘How then do we have such expressions as *give this to the
cooker*, where the *nominative* of the action of *cooking* becomes the
*recipient*,—or *having his body wounded by arrows, he went away
helplessly, being looked upon by the glances of his beloved*, \[where
the *object* of the act of *looking* becomes the *nominative* of the act
of *going* \].’—The answer to this has already been explained:—such
expressions become justified by the difference between the *efficiency*
and the *efficient* being regarded as secondary and figurative; as is
found to be the case in such expressions as ‘having eaten, he goes.’
Thus then, if the aot in question is meant to be a *worship*, then its
object cannot have the character of the ‘Deity’; while if the Sun and
the rest are ‘deities,’ then the act enjoined cannot be regarded as
‘worship.’ Nor can it be held that the Sun being well known as a
‘deity,’ the present injunction lays down its *worship*. Because the
term ‘deity’ is not a common name of the Sun and other gods, in the way
in which the term ‘*go*’ (cow) is of the ‘*śabaleya*’ and other bovine
varieties.”

To the above we make the following reply:—It is quite true that the Sun
and others are not, in their own form, ‘deities’; the term ‘deity’ is a
relative term; and it is only from an injunction that we can learn that
a certain being is the ‘deity’ of an act; the fact being that when a
certain offering is enjoined with reference to a being, this latter is
the ‘deity’ of that offering. It is for this reason that Agni is not the
‘deity’ of any other offering save that ‘dedicated to Agni.’ \[All this
is quite true\] but no injunction of ‘worship’ is possible without the
object to be worshipped; and deities are found to be mentioned as
objects of worship. Now if the act of ‘worship’ is not possible when the
term ‘deity’ is taken in its primary sense, then the ‘worship’ may be
taken as being of the nature of ‘sacrifice.’ But, in the absence of any
mention (in the injunction of feeding Brāhmaṇas) of the substance to be
offered and the deity to whom it is to be offered, the act in question
cannot acquire the character of true ‘sacrifice’; so that the text iu
question may be regarded as a descriptive reference for the purpose of
prescribing the ‘forenoon’ as the proper time for it; the sense being
that ‘all acts in honour of the gods should be done during the
forenoon.’

“Why is it said that the deity is not directly mentioned?”

For the simple reason that there is no word directly signifying any
deity. The term ‘deity’ that is actually found is the common name of all
deities; so that the injunction refers to the worshipping of Agni,
Āditya, Rudra, Indra, Viṣṇu, Sarasvatī and so forth; and during the
*worship* there is offering of incense, light, garland, presents and
such other things. In the case of Agni; the connection with the act of
worship offered is always direct; as regards Āditya (the Sun-god) since
he is far off, his worship consists in the placing of sandal-paste,
flowers, etc., on a clean spot; and as regards Indra and the other gods,
since they are not visible, their worshipping is done by the placing of
flower, etc., accompanied by a reference to their names. Though in the
act of worship, the beings worshipped form the predominant factor, yet
inasmuch as they are subservient to the act to be done, it is the act of
worship that comes to be recognised as what should be done. If the
substance offered were the predominant factor, then the Deity could
never form the subject of the injunction. All this is made clear in
Jaimim’s Mīmānsā-Sūtra, 2.1.6 and 7. The view put forward on the other
hand is perfectly reasonable, the case being analogous to that of the
Hymns and Eulogies. The Hymn is not made for the sake of the hymn
itself; so the *worship* also is not for the sake of the *worshipped*.
If might be argued that Hymns and Eulogies are not mentioned here by
name. But the answer to this has already been given. The accusative has
the sense of the instrumental, as in the expression ‘*juhoti*,’ where
‘*saktūn*’ has been taken as ‘*saktubhiḥ*.’

Similarly the sentence ‘*mṛdam gām daivatam pradakṣiṇāni kurvīta*,’—‘one
should have the clay, the cow, the deity to his right,’—lays down the
use of the right hand; the sense being that all acts done in honour of
the gods should be done with the right hand; the passage cannot mean
that the deities ensouling the clay, etc., should be actually placed on
the right; for the simple reason that the deities have no physical form.

The same holds good regarding the injunction ‘one should move up to the
gods.’ Since it is not possible for one to go near the gods by walking
on foot, and since the root ‘*gam*’ (as in ‘*abhigāccet*’) signifies
*knowledge*, why should ‘*abhigamana*’ differ from *Remembrance*? The
sense thus is that during the act one should think of the gods; *i.e*.,
he should avoid all anxiety or distraction of the mind. In this way this
*Smrti* is found to be one whose basis is actually found in the Vedic
Injunction, which says—‘One should think in his mind of that deity to
whom he may be offering the libation.’

“But this *thinking* of the deity is already implied in the *aiming*
(which has been put forward in the definition of the Deity),—which
cannot be done without *thinking*.”

This objection has no force; as mere *aiming* can be done also by a man
who is anxious and whose mind is distracted.

Thus then all suoḥ expressions as ‘the property of the gods,’ ‘the
cattle of the gods,’ ‘the substance of the gods’ and the like are to be
taken as referring to such cattle and things as hare been assigned to
(dedicated to) the gods. Some people have held that in the seotion
dealing with penalties to be inflicted upon persons stealing the
‘property of gods,’ it is the image of the god that is meant; as
otherwise the regulations bearing upon the subject would become liable
to he infringed. As regards the images upon whom the character of ‘gods’
has been imposed, things are called their ‘property’ on the basis of an
assumed sense of ownership; and it is such property that is referred to
as ‘property of the gods,’ in such passages as—‘the highest penalty is
to be inflicted on the stealing of the property of Gods, Brāhmaṇas and
Kings.’ In reality, gods can have no rights of ownership; and hence the
literal sense of the expression being inadmissible, it is only right
that we should accept the figurative one.

“In the present case what is the figurative sense? In every instance of
figurative use, the presenoe of a common function (or quality) forms the
basis; *e.g*., the expression ‘the Boy is Fire’ is used when the boy is
found to possess the white resplendence of fire. Similarly in every case
the figurative or secondary sense is recognised only where there is some
common property present;—the presence of suoḥ property being cognised by
means of perception and other means of cognition. In the case in
question however, since the sense of the *deity* is recognisable only by
the purpose served by it,—and the form of the deity cannot be
ascertained through that purpose,—how could there be any recognition of
common properties?”

Our answer is as follows:—We find particular forms of deities described
in the Mantras and Arthavādas; and all these descriptions are
interpreted as figurative. People who do not perceive any basis for such
interpretation take the passages in their literal sense and regard Indra
and the deities as actually possessing those forms; and the similarity
of such forms they actually perceive in the images; and in this sense
also it is only natural that the description should he regarded as
figurative.

Some people have explained that the feeding of Brāhmaṇas at *Śrāddha* in
honour of the Viśvedevas is what is described here as being ‘in honour
of the gods.’ But such feeding, being part of what is done ‘in honour of
ancestors,’ becomes included under the latter phrase, and the
re-iteration of it would he entirely meaningless. Then again, since we
have the generic term ‘gods,’ on what grounds could we restrict it to
the *Viśvedevas* only P If such restriction be based upon the
association of the term ‘*pitrya*’ ‘in honour of ancestors,’—then, since
the acts thus spoken of would not he included in ‘those done in honour
of ancestors,’—the two words could he justified on the analogy of the
expression ‘*go-balibarda*,’ ‘bovine bull,’ which is used even when
there is not much difference between what is denoted by the two
terms.—(189)

‘*Ṛṣivat*’—‘Like an ascetic; *i.e*. avoiding honey, meat and other
forbidden food’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘eating only a little
wild-growing rice and other food fit for the ascetic’ (Govindarāja,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

*Medhātithi* (p. 163, l. 17)—‘*Mṛtasya kartṛtvam*’—This refers to
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 10. 2. 55-56. The *Sarvasvāra*, a modification of the
*Jyotiṣṭoma* sacrifice, has been prescribed for by one who desires his
own death; and in course of this the sacrificer surrounds the Post with
a new piece of cloth and having addressed the words—‘O Brāhmaṇas, please
complete this sacrifce of mine,’—enters the fire. In connection with
this it is argued that the performer of the sacrifice having perished,
there can be no point in proceeding with it. But the final conclusion is
that the sacrifice must be proceeded with to its very end, as the
sacrifice as well as its *completion* is directly enjoined by the
*Śruti* text,—the latter by the words laid down as to be addressed to
the Brāhmaṇas.

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 424);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 291), which explains
the construction as ‘*ubhyarthitaḥ kāmamaśnīyāt, abhyarthitaḥ* meaning
‘requested,’ ‘invited’.

The duty—tbat one should eat the food given by one person only under
certain circumstances—that has just been prescribed, is meant for the
Brāhmaṇa only;—it has been so ordained ‘*by the sages*’—by the learned,
after having learnt it from the Veda. They do not intend this to apply
to the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya; which means that students belonging to
these two castes should not eat any food except what they get as alms.

*Objection*.—“As a matter of fact, it is only the Brāhmaṇa that is
entitled to eat at *Śrāddhas*; as is clear from such declarations
as—‘Which *Brahmaṇas* are to be fed at *Śrāddhaa*, and which to be
avoided?’—‘To the most deserving *Brāhamaṇa* etc.’ and so forth; from
which it is clear that the Brāhmaṇa alone is entitled to receive gifts.
Further, what we have here is a counter-exception, not an original
Injunction; and all denials are dependent upon possibility \[and in the
present case there is, as just pointed out, no possibility of the
feeding pertaining to any non-Brāhmaṇa\].”

To the above we make the following reply:—It has been ordained that
after the Brāhmaṇas have eaten, the remnant should be disposed of by
being made over to ‘relations’; and in this there is no restriction as
to caste; the man thus would feed any one who may happen to be his
‘relation’; and in this the recipients are indicated, not by the
caste-names ‘Kṣatriya’ etc., but simply by the general name ‘relation.’
It is in view of this possibility of non-Brāhmaṇas partaking of the food
at *Śrāddhas* that we have the prohibition in the Text.—(190)

On coming from some other place, ‘*he should stand looking at the face
of his Teacher*,’—he should not sit;—‘*having under control*, *his
body*’;—*i.e*., he should not do such acts as the throwing about of
hands and feet, laughing and so forth; nor should he speak anything
needlessly.

He should control his ‘*organs of sensation*,’—*i.e*, if he finds
anything wonderful near the Teacher, he should not think of it again and
again. He should control the Auditory and other organs also; the control
of the visual organ is secured by looking at the Teacher’s face.

He should control the mind also; *i.e*., he should avoid the thought of
difficulties pertaining to soriptural matters, or of the building of
houses, granaries and the like.

The prohibition contained under 288 with regard to ‘making an effort to
control, etc.,’—is meant to prohibit attachment.

The meaning of all this is that when he is near his Teacher, he should
not permit the slightest movement of his organs, even towards such
things as are not prohibited.

The arm should be raised, not only above the saered thread, but also out
of the upper garment.

The adverb ‘*always*’ is meant to imply that the arm is to be raised not
only while he is standing, nor only while he is reading, but on other
occasions also.

‘*Well-behaved*’;—he should have his behaviour—speech and other
acts—good, above reproach. The word ‘implies that even when not near the
Teacher, he should not utter indecorous words, or do any such wrongful
act.

‘*Well-guarded*’;—*i.e*., fully self-controlled, regarding speech, mind
and eyes,—he should avoid even the slightest defects. The man who
follows the bent of his desires (and does not restrain them) is called
among people ‘unguarded’; and the opposite of this is ‘*well-guarded*.’

Others explain this to mean that ‘near his Teacher one should keep his
body covered, and he should not take off his upper garment.’

In the manner thus described, ‘*he should stand*’ (as laid down in the
preceding verse); but when the Teacher says to him ‘*be seated*’—either
in so many words, or by the gesture of his brows, etc.; the function of
the injunction being to convey the direction, and this conveying need
not be done only by means of words,—‘*he should sit*.’

‘*Advancing towards him, when he* *is* *standing*’;—when the Teacher
gives his orders standing, the pupil should advance towards him a few
steps.

‘*Going forward* *to* *him, when he advances*’;—*i.e*., going up to the

‘*When the teacher has his face averted*,’—the pupil should sit facing
him; that is, if the Teacher happen to have his face turned the other
way when he gives his directions, the pupil should go over to the side
facing the teacher and then do the aforesaid (listening and conversing).

‘*When the teacher is at a distance*,’—the pupil should go near him,
approach him.

When the teacher is seated, as also when he is lying down, the pupil
should *bow down*— humbly bend his body low.

‘*Nideśe*’ means ‘close by’; when he is sitting close by, then the
aforesaid acts should be done after bowing low.—(197)

This is a statement commendatory of what has been enjoined in the
foregoing verses. Hence it has to be explained as follows:—

‘*Through cenmre*’;—*i.e*., by listening to the censuring of his
Teacher—‘*one becomes an ass*’; the ablative being taken either as
denoting *cause*, or as having the force of the participle; *parīvādāt*
being construed as ‘*parīvādam śrutvā*,’ ‘having listened to censuring.’

‘*Defamer*,’—the person listening to defamation is figuratively called
‘defamer just as one preparing meat has been called the ‘Killer’ of the
animal. As for the act of defaming itself, the prohibition of this
becomes naturally implied by the prohibition of hearing it.

‘*One who lives upon*’;—he who supports himself on what he receives from
his Teacher; or one who behaves ill-mannerly towards him.

‘*One who is jealous*’;—who does not brook the rise and advancement of
his Teacher and burns within (at its sight).

The two latter have not been spoken of before this; hence what is said
in regard to these is to be regarded as direct injunction.

‘*Parīvāda*’ and ‘*parivāda*,’ both forms—with long as well as with the
short *ī*—are correct, according to Pāṇini, 6.3.122.—(201)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Paribhoktā*’—‘He who lives upon the Teacher’ (Medhātithi);—‘he who
eats, without the Teacher’s permission, the best food obtained by
begging’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

The verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107) where ‘*paribhoktā*’ is
explained as ‘one who makes use of the Teacher’s wealth, without his
permission’;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 491), which also
explains ‘*paribhoktā*’ as ‘one who lives upon the Teacher’s property,
without his permission.’

*Medhātithi* (P. 169,1. 16)—‘*Samskartā...ghātakaḥ*’—This is a clear
reference to Manu 5.51—

&gt; anumantā viśasitā nihantā krayavikrayī \|  
&gt; saṃskartā copahartā ca khādakaśceti ghātakāḥ \|\|

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 42), which explains
‘*paribhoktā*’ as one who eats food without presenting it to the
Teacher;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 120) as forbidding the
decrying of the Teacher by the Pupil himself; it explains ‘*paribhoktā*’
as ‘one who makes use of the Teacher’s property without his permission.’

What is prohibited here is the act of sending sandal-paint, garlands and
other articles of worship through a messenger. It being found possible
that one might be prompted to offer such worship by the consideration
that ‘whether one does an act himself or gets it done by another, he is
equally the *doer* in both cases, since the prompter also has been
regarded as the agent,’—the present verse prohibits such offering of
worship through other persons. There is no harm in doing this, either
when one is himself incapacitated, or when h e happens to be in a
different village; for we find people adopting such usage as—when the
Teacher has gone to another village, the pupil tells some one who
happens to be going to the same village ‘please offer my salutations to
my Teacher,’ and this other person goes and salutes him.

‘*Nor when angry*’;—it being impossible for any one to be angry with his
Teacher, the meaning is that if one happens to be angry with some one,
he should, at the time of offering hi s obeisance, give up the anger and
keep his mind calm. Some people read ‘*kruddham*,’ (making ‘angry’
qualify the Teacher).

‘*Nor near*’—in proximity to—‘*a woman*’—his loving wife; *i.e*., not
while the Teacher is seated near her. The entire process of service of
the Teacher being meant for winning his favour, anything likely to
displease him has been prohibited. It is in view of this that the term
‘woman’ has been explained as above.

‘*Conveyance*’—such as the cart and the rest.

‘*Seat*’—small or large wooden platforms.

From these one should come down and then salute the Teacher.

Under verse 119 what was laid down was simply *rising* from the seat;
while here it is *coming down* from it that is enjoined. When one is
seated upon a wooden platform, it is possible for him to *rise* without
*coming down* from it.

“But *coming down* from the seat is not possible without *rising*; so
that the *rising* being already implied in the present injunction, whàt
is laid down in 119 becomes superfluous.”

It is not superfluous; what is meant by it is that when it so happens
that the pupil is seated with his face towards one side, and the Teacher
approaches from behind him,—as soon tvs the pupil becomes cognisant of
his approach, he should turn his face towards the Teacher and then rise;
and be should not rise and then turn round; as in so doing the act of
*turning towards* the Teacher becomes intervened by that of *rising*;
and this might displease the Teacher, who would think that ‘he was
rising for some other reason, not for honouring me.’

Thus the mention of the ‘seat’ has its use in both places (here and in
119).—(202)

The terra ‘cart’ is connected with each of the foregoing terras; and the
cart yoked with, drawn by, oxen (), ‘horses’ (‘*aśva*’) and ‘camels’
(*uṣṭra*) is called ‘*gośvoṣṭvayānam?*’; the terra ‘*yukta*’ (‘yoked,’
‘drawn by’) being dropped, as in the word ‘*dadhighāṭa*’ (‘curd-jar’).
That this is so is clear from the fact that it is not possible for two
men to ride together on the hare back of the ox, etc. If we had the word
‘*yāna*’ standing by itself, then we might have taken the verse itself
as permitting the riding along with the teacher on the bare back of the
ox, etc. In some places we do find this to he permitted by usage.

‘*Terrace*,’—the surface on the top of houses; and in such places
sitting with the Teacher is as possible as on the floor of houses.

‘*Grass-mats*’—beds made of grass and leaves, etc.

‘*Reed-mats*’—beds made of reeds and sticks.

‘*Bocks*’—stone-slabs either on the top of hills or elsewhere.

‘*Benches*’—scats made of wood, called ‘*pota*,’ ‘*varta*,’ etc.

‘*Boats*’;—*i.e*., contrivances for floating on water, which would
include rafts and other similar things.—(204)

on page 491, where it is quoted in support of the view that the
prohibition contained in verse 198 must refer to cases other than those
of carts and conveyances. It further adds that though the riding on
conveyances drawn by ox etc. is prohibited,—yet the sanction accorded
here is in view of the possibility of such lading in abnormal times of
distress. It is interesting to note that no such scruples have
prejudiced Medhātithi, who apparently belonged to a part of the country
where riding on bullock-carts is permissible; while the author of
*Vīramitrodaya* belonged to a part of the country where such riding is
prohibited, e.g. in Mithilā.

The present verse permits the afore-mentioned behaviour towards one’s
Teacher to be adopted in certain other cases.

Since the whole of the present deals with study, the term ‘*guru*’
should throughout be taken in the sense of ‘teacher.’ If the teacher of
one’s Teacher happens to be near, he should behave towards him as
towards his own teacher.

‘*When he happens to be close* *by*.’—This implies that it is not
incumbent upon the pupil to go over to the house of his teacher’s
teacher for the purpose of paying respects to him.

While living in the Teacher’s house,—‘*until* *he is permitted by his
Teacher*’—allowed by him to do so,—he should not go to pay respects to
his own ‘elders’;—to his father, mother, etc. This does not mean that
when these elders come to his Teacher’s house, hc shall wait for the
Teacher’s permission before he offers obeisance to them.

“Whence do you get this meaning?”

It follows from the fact that one’s parents are the highest objects of
veneration; and as regards the paternal uncle, maternal uncle and other
relations, if one salutes them, this does not stand in the way of his
proper behaviour towards the Teacher. For after all, all his efforts are
meant to win the Teacher’s favour.

As regards the order to be observed in saluting the mother, the father
and the Teacher, when all these happen to be together,—it has already
been declared that the Mother is superior to all; and as between the
Father and the Teacher, there is option: In as much as the respect due
to the Teacher is by reason of the position of the ‘Father’ having been
imposed upon him, the Father should be regarded as superior; but since
it has been declared (in 146) that ‘the father imparting the Veda is
superior,’ it would follow that the Teacher is superior. It is for this
reason that there is option.—(205)

This also is an instance of ‘Transference.’

Teachers other than the Preceptor are called here ‘intellectual
teacher’—such as the Sub-Teacher and the rest. One should behave towards
these just as it has been detailed above (under 192 *et seq*.).

‘*Towards blood-relations’—i.e*., towards the elder brother, the
paternal uncle, etc

‘*Constant behaviour*’—*i.e*., behaviour as towards the Preceptor.

As distinguished from the ‘Preceptor,’ the other ‘Intellectual Teachers’
are to be so honoured only during the period of one’s learning under
them.

‘*Towards persons*’—friends and others—‘*restraining him from
sin*’—*i.e*., from evils, such as connection with other women and so
forth. It has been said that when one is found to be thinking within
himself of doing some evil deed, then his friends and others ‘should
restrain him from sin, even to the extent of dragging him by his hairs’;
and towards one who restrains him in this way, he should behave as
towards his Teacher,—even if he happens to be of equal or inferior age.

Also towards those who give salutary advice, independently of books. Or,
‘giver of salutary advice’ may be taken as standing for noble-minded

‘*Superiors*’;—those possessed of greater amount of wealth and learning.
Towards these ‘*he should behave always as towards the
Teacher*’;—*i.e*., he should offer him obeisance, welcome and so forth.

In this verse many such words have been used as are superfluous; but in
as much as this is a metrical work, such usage is not objectionable.
‘Towards superiors’ was all that should h ave been said here; ‘as
towards the Teacher’ would be already implied; ‘*behaviour*’ has already
been mentioned in the preceding verse. Many such instances can be found
in this work.

‘*Towards the Teacher’s son who has acquired the position of the
Teacher*’;—the addition of the word ‘*ācārya*’ is meant to show that the
son should have obtained the position of the Teacher. The sense is that,
if during the Teacher’s absence, his son teaches his pupils for a few
days, he should be treated as a Teacher

Another reading is ‘*guruputresvaṭhāryeṣu*.’ The term ‘*ārya*’ in’this
case would mean ‘one belonging to the highly qualified Brāhmaṇa-caste,’
as we find in such instances as—‘śūdrāccāryo jyāyān.’

This verse does not enjoin that such treatment should lie accorded to
all the sons of the Teacher.

‘*Towards the Teacher’s own blood-relations*.’—The epithet ‘own’ has
been added for the purpose of restricting the statement to members of
the Teacher’s family; the mere fact of being a member of the Teacher’s
family is the sole ground for the treatment being accorded to
him,—irrespectively of age, learning, etc.—(207)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Ācārye*’—is construed as qualifying ‘*guruputre*’ according to
Medhātithi, who explains the two terms as ‘the teacher’s son who imparts
instruction for a few days during the absence of the teacher’.—Another
reading, suggested by

Medhātithi is ‘*āryeṣu*’, explained as ‘duly qualified Brāhmaṇas’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Govindarāja);—‘virtuous’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘older in age’ (Vīramitrodaya).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462), where we
have the following explanations:—‘*Śreyaḥsu*’ means ‘those possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications;—‘*āryeṣu*’ means ‘older in
age’;—‘*guroḥ svabandhuṣu*’ means ‘the teacher’s uncles and other
relations—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 34).

For those persons who do not adopt, the reading whereby the term
‘*ācārya*’ (teacher) is made the qualification of the ‘Teacher’s son’ in
the preceding verse,—it would follow that the entire treatment of the
Teacher is to he accorded to the Teacher’s son who is qualified and
belongs to the same caste, even though he may not have done any
teaching. And it is this wide rule that is restricted by the present
verse.—It is only the Teacher’s son imparting instruction that deserves
the same honour as the Teacher,—and not he who does not impart
instruction.

“That the Teacher’s son who imparts instruction should be honoured like
the teacher follows from the mere fact of instruction having been
received from him; and from what we read in connection with the story
relating to the infant (*vide* 151 above) the propriety of similar
treatment of the junior is already known; so that even for the mention
of the ‘younger or of equal age’ the present verse would not be
required.”

True; what has been said before is the treatment to be accorded to one
who teaches the Veda, or even a portion of the Veda,—even though he be
not the regular preceptor; while the person referred to here is not one
who has made one get up the Veda; it is only one who teaches for a few
days or even for a part of the day. And since such a person would not be
either a ‘Preceptor’ or a ‘sub-teacher,’ his honouring would not be
included under what has gone before; so it becomes necessary to enjoin
it in the present connection.

It is from this verse that we understand that the entire treatment of
the Teacher is not to be accorded to one who teaches only broken parts
of a *manṭra*.

For those however who read ‘*ācārya*,’ ‘who does the work of teaching’
in the preceding verse,—the present verse would be a mere reference to
what has been enjoined before, for the purpose of adding the injunction
occurring in the next verse.

‘*Or a student of sacrificial ritual*’;—the mention of ‘sacrificial
ritual’ is only by way of illustration; the meaning is that even though
he be a mere student of a subsidiary science, or of a portion of the
Veda—*Mantra* portion or the Brāhamaṇa portion,—yet he deserves to be
honoured like the teacher; only if he happens to be the teacher’s son
and imparts instruction in some science, he should be honoured like the
teacher. Though this has been already said (in the preceding verse) yet
that does not matter, as the present verse is meant to be merely
re-iterative.

Some people offer the following explanation:—“The phrase ‘*imparting
instruction*’ stands for the *capacity of teaching*; the sense being
that if the teacher’s son has learnt the Vedas and is capable of
teaching it, he should be honoured like the teacher;—whether he actually
docs the work of teaching or not.”

This explanation is verbally quite correct. The Present Participal affix
(in ‘*adhyāpayan*,’ ‘imparting instruction’) has the sense of
*characterisation*; and this characterisation is that of an act; so that
the use is in accordance with Pāṇini 3.2.128; and the *act* is directly
mentioned as that ‘*deserving* *the same honour as the teacher*.’—(208)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Yajñakarmaṇi*’—Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa construe this with
‘*śiṣyaḥ*’, and explain the phrase ‘*Yajñakarmaṇi śiṣyaḥ*’ as ‘student
of sacrificial ritual (and other Vedic subsidiaries)’;—Nandana construes
it with ‘*adhyāpayan*’, explaining the phrase as ‘who imparts
instruction in sacrificial ritual—Kullūka and Rāghavānanda take it by
itself, explaining it as ‘who happens to be present *at a sacrificial
performance*’.

‘*Adhyāpayan*’—‘Teaching’ (Medhātithi); ‘Having the capacity to teach’
(Kullūka, also Vīramitrodaya).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462) where
‘*adhyāpayan*’ is explained as ‘capable of teaching’; and the
construction is explained as *yajñakarmaṇi guruvanmānamarhati*’—*i.e*.,
‘at a sacrificial performance, he deserves to be honoured like the
Teacher’;—thus agreeing on all points with the explanation given by
Kullūka.

‘*Shampooing*’—rubbing after oiling—he shall not do.

‘*Washing of his feet*’ also he shall not do;—for the teacher’s son.

It is from this prohibition that it follows that, even though not
directly enjoined, these acts should be done for the teacher. When
however the teacher’s son himself becomes the teacher, by becoming fully
equipped to teach the entire Veda,—then the eating of the food left by
him, etc., come to be done for his own sake; and the present prohibition
does not apply to the acts under such circumstances. For their
prohibition refers to what is due to the son, through the injunction
transferring to him the treatment accorded to the teacher,—and not to
what would be due to him by direct injunction.—(209)

‘*The teacher’s ladies*’—wives—‘*belonging* *to the same caste*’—of the

‘*Those not belonging to the same caste*’ are to be honoured only ‘*with
rising and salutations*.’ The plural number in ‘salutations’ has the
sense of ‘*et cetera*’: hence the doing of what is agreeable and

‘*One who is full twenty years old*’;—*i.e*., fully grown up. There is
no harm in the case of the pupil who is still a ‘child,’ not having
passed his sixteenth year. What is meant is one who has completed his
twenty years. To the same effect we have the next qualification—‘*who is
conscious of what is good and what is bad*.’ The ‘good’ and ‘bad’ meant
here are the pleasures and pains arising from sexual love, also the
beauty and ugliness of women, as also their fidelity and infidelity.

‘*twenty*.’—(212)

It is the nature of women that they make men fall off from their
fidelity: by associating with men, women would make them deviate from
their vow.

For this reason the wise are never ‘*unguarded*’; *i.e*., they shun
women from a distance;—‘unguardedness’ would consist in touching her and
so forth.

It is in the very nature of things that a young woman, when touched,
produces a disturbance in the mind; and this mental disturbance itself
has been interdicted, to say nothing of other vulgarities.

It should not be thought that the person who has full control over his
organs and who is fully aware that even locking at the Teacher’s wife
with impure motives is a heinous offence, incurs no danger by touching
her feet. Because so far as women are concerned, the person cognisant of
the grievousness of the sin, as well as the person not so cognisant,
both are equal; for no amount of learning is any use in this matter;
women are capable of leading astray—on the wrong path, contrary to usage
and scriptures—all men.

‘*Who becomes a servile follower of desire and passion*,’—Who becomes
contaminated with desire and passion. This epithet only serves to
indicate a particular condition of man. Barring the too young and too
old, and one who has reached the highest stage of Yoga, there is no one,
with the exception of one who has entirely destroyed his human
susceptibilities, who is not attracted by women, just as iron is
attracted by the magnet. This is not due to any powerful influence
intentionally exercised; it is in the very nature of things that at the
sight of a young woman, the mind of man becomes upset, specially that of
young students.—(214)

This describes the reward in connection with the entire body of

Veda by means of serving the Teacher.

Just as a certain man digging the earth by a spade, or some such

*Vyāsa Smṛti* (1.36, 37).—‘In this manner, living, from day to day, on

‘*Muṇḍaḥ*’—means that he should shave the whole of his head.

‘*Jaṭilaḥ*’—one who has hairs *braided, i.e*., inextricably sticking to
one another.

Or one whose ‘*śikhā*’ top-hair,’ only is braided; and the rest of the
head is shaven.

And he should so behave himself that the sun does not set while he is
still in the village; ‘*village*’ here includes the town also. The
meaning is that at the time of sun-set he should betake himself to the
forest. Similarly the sun should not rise while he is in the village;
that is, for the Religious Student, sun-rise also should take place
while he is in the forest.

‘*Enam*’—refers to the Religious Student.

Others have explained this to mean that ‘the Sun should not set while he
is still addicted to the vulgar acts of sleeping and the like.’ To this
same effect we have the term ‘sleeping’ in the next verse. Under this
explanation what the verse prohibits is sleeping during the two
twilights; and it does not mean that he should be actually in the forest
at those times; for the Student would be still too young and would be
frightened (by being in the forest at twilight). In fact Gautama (9.10)
has declared that the twilights should be spent outside the village
after the ‘*Godāna*’ ceremony; and this ceremony is laid down as to be
performed in the sixteenth year; and arrived at that age, the student
can, if he reaches the forest, offer his twilight prayers there.—(219)

In connection with what has gone before one should perform the following
expiatory rite.

If while the student is still sleeping, the sun should rise and thereby
make him incur sin.—‘*Abhi*’ is a preposition according to Pāṇini’s
Sūtra ‘*abhirabhāge*’; and hence we have the accusative ending in
‘*śayanam*.’—The meaning is that if while the student is sleeping, the
sun should rise, then *he should fast during the day*.

Some people oífer the following explanation:—“If the offence is
committed in the morning, the reciting and fasting are to be done during
the day, food being taken at night; while if the offence is committed in
the evening, the reciting and fasting are to be done during the night,
food being taken next morning. So that the term ‘day’ is purely
illustrative.” And in support of their view they quote the words of
Gautama (23.21)—‘He should go without food during the day, and if the
sun sets before him he should fast during the night, reciting the
*Sāvitrī*.’

This however is not right. In both cases the expiatory rite should be
performed during the day; specially as there is no authority for
regarding the term ‘day’ of the text as illustrative; as the term ‘day’
does not have its denotation dependent upon that of the term ‘night’; it
is entirely independent. Hence the right meaning appears to he that
there should be option; that is, if the person is one who will not fall
ill by keeping up the whole night, he might do it during the night;
while others would do it during the day.

That the ‘*reciting*’ is of the *Sāvitrī*, we gather from the words of
Gautama (quoted above).

“How can Gautama be quoted as authority on this point?”

As a matter of fact, the verb ‘*should recite*’ is incomplete, since it
is not mentioned what is to be recited. And when there is such
incompleteness, it is only right that the missing detail should be
filled in from other scriptural sources.

But what the term ‘*day*’ mentions is the *time*; and this does not
stand in need of any other time, so that there is no need for calling in
the help of Gautama.

Or, the right explanation may be that, since the present verse
prescribes the expiatory rite to be performed on the omission of the
twilight prayers, the reciting of the *SācUrī* eorties in naturally; it
has been declared above (2.88) that ‘there is nothing higher than the
*Sāvitrī*.’

‘*Intentionally*;’—*i.e*., who knowingly sleeps in the evening.

‘*Unintentionally*;’—when he has been sleeping for a long time and fails
to perceive the advent of evening; this is what is meant by ‘absence of
intention.’ The sense of all this is as follows:—When the omission is
intentional and due to careless-ṇess, it is necessary to perform the
expiatory rite here prescribed; he who omits the prayers at sun-set and
sun-rise, for him the expiatory rite has been prescribed as ‘fasting,’
which has to be done at the neglect of all compulsory duties.

Or, he who intentionally transgresses the scriptural ordinance, this
also is ‘ignorance’ on his part.—(220)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Dinam*’—“The translation of the last words (*Shall fast during the
next day muttering the Sāvitrī*) follows Govindarāja and Kullūka; while
Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda state that the penance shall be
performed *during the (next) day (or night*), and that he who neglects
the evening prayer shall fast in the evening and repeat the Gāyatrī
during the night.”—Buhler.

Medhātithi is not quite accurately represented here. For his view is
clearly put in paras 2 and 3, on page 575 (Translation) where the view,
that “if the offence is committed in the evening the reciting and
fasting are to be done during the night”, has been rejected in
unmistakable terms.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 447), as
laying down an expiation for sleeping at sunrise;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 398), as laying down the expiation for repeated
delinquency.

In as much as there is great sin accruing from sleeping at sun-set and
sun-rise,—therefore ‘*having sipped water*—‘*with mind calm*’—intent
upon the purpose—‘*and collected*’—having set aside all
distractions;—‘*in a dean place, reciting the mantras to be
recited*,’—*i.e*., the *Praṇava*, the *Vyāhṛtis* and the
*Sāvitrī*;—‘*one should attend upon the two twilights*.’ The two
twilights are the objects to be attended upon; and ‘attendance’ in this
case can only be in the form of a particular disposition of the mind.

Or, the construction may be—‘*During the two twilights he shall attend
upon*—the Sun.’ Since the mantra (Sāvitrī) is one sacred to the Sun, it
is the Sun that should be the object of attendance; *i.e*., having given
up all distraction, he should fix his mind upon the Sun.

The rest of the verse is a descriptive commendation of the foregoing
injunction; the *attending* alone being the object of the injunction.

Others explain that the verse is meant to be the injunction of the
‘*clean place*.’

But in this case there would be a needless repetition. In connection
with all acts it has been laid down that ‘it should be done by one who
is clean’; and if one were to sit in an unclean place, how could he be
regarded as ‘clean’?—(222)

‘*If either a woman*,’—*i.e*., the teacher’s wife,—‘*or a junior
person*’—a younger boy,—having learnt from the teacher—‘*do something
good,’—i.e*., perform acts conducive to the triad beginning with
‘*dharma*’ \[ *i*. *e*., acts conducive to religious merit, worldly
prosperity and pleasure\]—‘*all that me should perform*.’ It is possible
that by reason of their association with the teacher they may have
obtained the requisite knowledge.

Or ‘*junior person*’ may stand for the Śūdra employed in the Teacher’s
service; and if he should offer such advice as—‘the two excretory organs
are to be washed in this manner,—wash your hands thoroughly, you have
forgotten the right order of applying mud and water;—when giving him
water I have often seen your Teacher washing his posterior parts in this
way that he cleans it first with mud, then with water,’—*i.e*., if being
fully cognisant of the right usage he should offer such
advice;—similarly if the Teacher’s wife should teach him the right way
to sip water; ‘*all that he should perform faithfully*’—with full faith;
and he should not disregard the advice as coming from a *Śūdra* or a
woman.

‘*Do*.’—What is meant, is practice following the precept. It is going to
be declared later on that ‘one should derive knowledge of his duty and
cleanliness from all sources.’

It is quite possible that the Teacher himself might have told his wife
to help the boy, who is like a son to him, to sip water in the right
manner; or he might tell (the servant)—‘you should give him mud and
water for cleaning his excretory organs’;—and under all these
circumstances, the pupil should follow the advice as to the using of the
mud and the pouring of water.

Or, the meaning may be that, in the matter of the purity of metal,
stone, and water, etc., he should accept as authoritative the method
adopted in the Teacher’s house by his wife and servants. In this way the
present verse would be laying down the extent to which the usage of
women and Śūdras should be relied upon.

“In this way then, the practice of all persons ignorant of the Veda
becomes authoritative; and this is not right; because as a matter of
fact, not even the slightest practice of persons ignorant of the Veda
should be authoritative. The very root (of the authority of practices)
consists of connection with persons learned in the Veda. If this root,
in the shape of connection with persons learned in the Veda, is present,
then that would supply the requisite authority; where would be the use
of mentioning the *woman*? Specially as in matters like this, no
authority can be intended, to rest in the practices of women and
*Śūdras*. If such bad been the intention of the Author, he would have
said this under the section dealing with the ‘sources of knowledge of
Dharma.’”

From all this it is clear that the truth of the matter is that the
present verse is meant to introduce the explanation of what is ‘good’
(coming in the next verse).

Or, it may be regarded as re-iterating the trustworthiness of the words
of the Teacher; the sense being—‘Even when the woman or the *Śūdra*
state the words of the Teacher, it is right to act up to them,—what to
say of what is told directly by the Teacher himself!’

‘*As also that in which his mind finds satisfaction*.’—The purport of
this has been explained under the term ‘Self-satisfaction’ (2.6).

In every way it is clear that there is not much useful purpose served by
this verse.—(223)

In a friendly spirit, the Author now proceeds to explain what it is that
is praiseworthy, which, when carried into practice, does no harm either
visible or invisible, and which is called ‘good’ in ordinary parlance.

What is stated here is not founded on the Veda, nor is it an explanation
of the denotation of words, as we have had before in the case of such
words as ‘preception’ and the rest. The fact of the matter is that when
a man acts he seeks to obtain something ‘good’; and the Author is going
to explain that such and such a thing is the ‘good’ for the sake of
which man acts.

On this point he puts forward the different opinions that have been
held.

\(1\) Some people have held that *spiritual merit and wealth are “good*”
‘Spiritual merit’ consists in the due observance of the Injunctions and
Interdictions contained in the scriptures. ‘Wealth’ consists in cattle,
lands, gold and so forth. These alone constitute “good”; since man’s
happiness depends upon them.

\(2\) Another opinion is that ‘*pleasure and wealth*’ constitute the
“good.” Pleasure is the one thing desired by men; hence pleasure is the
“good and wealth also, since it is conducive to pleasure. The *Cārvākas*
(Atheists) have declared that “Pleasure is the one end of man, and
wealth is the means to it, as also is ‘Spiritual Merit,’ if there is
such a thing.”

\(3\) \[The third opinion is that\] Spiritual Merit is the highest
‘good’ of all,—all this being based upon that. To this end it has been
declared that ‘from Spiritual Merit proceed Wealth and Pleasure.’

\(4\) That Wealth is the sole ‘good’ is held by tradesmen aud
professionals.

\(5\) The real truth is that it consists in ‘*the aggregate of the
three*’ Hence it follows that one should attend to Wealth and Pleasure
also, but only such as are compatible with Spiritual Merit, and not such
as are contrary to it. So says Gautama (9.46)—‘One should, as far as
lies in his power, make his mornings, middays and evenings fruitful with
Spiritual Merit, Wealth and Pleasure.’

‘*Aggregate of three*’;—*i.e*., a group consisting of three factors.
That is, the name ‘good’ is applied by convention to the three taken
together.—(224)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

Hopkins remarks “*four* schools are noted but he ignores the fifth,—the
Siddhānta—‘*trivargamiti tu sthitiḥ*’ ‘the truth is that it is the
aggregate of the three.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 158), which adds that *Dharma*,
*Artha* and *Kāma* are the ‘group of three’;—this constitutes the
‘*Śreyaḥ*’, which one should constantly bear in mind as the aim to be
attained.

*Gautama* (9.48.49).—‘Either the morning or the midday or tho evening,
he shall not make devoid of merit, wealth and pleasure;—from among these
he should regard merit as the highest.’

*Viṣṇu* (1.8).—‘Merit is the essence of all.’

wealth follows.’

In fact no one should bo treated with disrespect; specially these. That

‘*Distressed*’—injured by them.

‘Treating with disrespect’ consists in disregard; the omitting of honour
due; as also insulting, which is called ‘want of respect.’

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ has been added only for filling up the
metre.—(225)

This verse is commendatory of what has gone above.

That supreme Brahmaṇ which is described in the Vedantic Upaniṣads—of
that the Preceptor is the ‘*embodiment*’—*i.e*., he is as it were the
very image of Brahman. ‘*The father is the embodiment of
Prajāpati*’—*i.e*., Hiraṇyagarbha. The mother is the same as this
earth,—both being equally capable; of bearing burdens. ‘*One’s
own*’—*i.e*., uterine—‘*brother is the embodiment of the self*’—the
conscious entity within the body.

All the gods here named are possessed of majestic greatness, and destroy
one, if they are treated with disrespect, while if propitiated, they
endow one with all desirable things; and similar to these are the
preceptor and the rest; who thus become eulogised by this verse.—(226)

This is another commendatory statement describing a past event.

‘*Trouble*’—pain;—‘*Parents*’–‘father and mother’;—‘*of children*’—of
their offsprings. ‘*At the birth*’—from conception up to the tenth year
of their age. The ‘trouble’ of the mother consists in the bearing of the
child in the womb; then again, parturition endangers the very life of
women. After the birth of the child, there follows the trouble of
rearing him; all this is known by all persons in their own experience.
For the father also there is ‘trouble’ beginning with *Upanayana* and
ending in the explanation of the meaning of Vedic texts.

The term ‘*birth*’ here cannot mean *conception*; as this act entails no
trouble at all; what are meant are all the acts that follow the act of
*conceiving*, all which are troublesome.

‘*For that*’—trouble—‘*there can be no compensation*’—payment of the
debt; the repayment of the benefits conferred; this cannot be done
‘*even in a hundred years*’—*i.e*., even during several lives; what to
say of a single life! There may be some compensation for parents if one
presents them with innumerable wealth or saves them from a very great
calamity.—(227)

should do what is pleasing to*’; and one should not be satisfied with
acting agreeably to them once, twice or thrice only.

‘*On these three*’—preceptor and the rest—‘*being satisfied*’—*i.e*.,
when they have been propitiated by devoted service,—‘*all austerity*’;
*i.e*., the rewards that Are obtained by the performance of the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ and other penances for several years are obtained from
the satisfaction of these three.—(228)

*Question*.—“How can the reward of austerities be obtained by means of
serving the mother, etc., which is not austerity at all?”

*Answer*.—Because attending upon the feet of those persons is the best
form of austerity.

‘*Until he is permitted by them*,’—the pupil—*'should not perform any
other meritorious act*, that may stand in the way of his serving of the
three persons; *e.g*., bathing at sacred places, keeping of vows and
fasts, which, by reason of their leading to the boy’s body being
emaciated, causes anxiety in their minds. Even for the performing of the
Jyotiṣṭoma and other sacrifices, it is necessary to obtain their
permission;

because the disregarding of these persons has been interdicted; and if
the boy were not to consult them regarding the performance of acts
involving much effort and expenditure of wealth, they would feel
bewildered and would feel as if they were disregarded. There is no use
in taking permission for the performing of such acts as are
compulsory.—(229)

What is stated here is on the understanding that there is no difference
between the cause and its effects.

‘*These have been declared to be the three regions*,’—because they are
the means by which one is enabled to reach the three regions.

‘*These the three life-stages*’—*i.e*., with the exception of *the
first*, that of the Religious Student. The meaning is that the reward
obtained by means of the three life-stages beginning with that of the
Householder is obtained if these three persons are satisfied.

‘*These the three Vedas*’;—because service of them brings the same
reward that is obtained by reciting the three Vedas.

‘*These the three Fires*’;—because the serving these brings the rewards
that are obtained by the performance of acts done with the help of the
three sacrificial fires.

This also is purely eulogistic.—(230)

‘*This region*;’—*i.e*., the Earth; the Mother being equal to the Earth,
on account of both of them being capable of bearing burdens.

‘*By devotion to his* *Father*, *the middle region*;’—*i.e*., the sky.
The Father has been described as Prajāpati; and according to the
followers of the Nirukta, Prajāpati has his abode in the middle Region;
and he is the sustainer or protector of men.

‘*The Region of Brahman*’—*i.e*., the solar region; according to the
declaration (in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad*) that ‘the Sun is Brahman, such
is the teaching.’

‘*Region*’—means a particular place.

‘*Acquires*’—gains.

All this is a purely commendatory statement; and much attention need not
be paid to it. Nor is it that only persons desirous of sovereignty over
the said regions are to do honour to the Rather, etc.; for the
injunction is not an optional one. In fact, the mere fact of the person
being one’s father is the sole condition of his being honoured; and the
omission of it involves a transgression of the scriptures.—(233)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Honoured*’—respected. The mention of ‘honouring’ indicates that the
person honoured is intent upon repaying the benefits he has received. As
a matter of fact, the person who is honoured becomes pleased and tries
to repay it. Or, ‘*honoured*’ may be taken as standing for ‘pleased.’
And as Duties are endless, the entire satisfaction of these would not be
possible; so that what is indicated is ‘anxiety to bring about the
desired result’; hence what is meant is that ‘all acts done by him bear
fruit quickly.’

‘*By him who has honoured these three*’—who has satisfied them by his
service.

If these persons are not honoured, then whatever meritorious act the man
does with a view to reward remains fruitless.

‘*All acts*’,—*i.e*., rites performed according to *Śrauta and Smārta*
rules.

This verse is purely commendatory. The fact of the matter is that the
injunction of honouring the three persons aims at the accomplishment of
something desirable for man; so that by transgressing it the man would
incur a great sin, which would obstruct the fulfilment of any reward
that he might have won by his acts. It is with a view to this that it is
said that ‘*all his acts remain fruitless*.’—(234)

‘*Pāratryam*’—‘*that which is done for the sake of another life*’—is
that act whose reward is obtained during the next birth. The form of
this word is Vedic.

Whatever religious act he should do, apart from the serving of them,
without causing them trouble,—of all that he should inform them; he
should make it known to them.

The qualification ‘*without injury to*’ has been added with a view to
convey the following idea:—One should, not

press them to permit the performance of an act that may be injurious to
them. It sometimes happens that a simple-minded person, when pressed,
permits the doing of an act, not minding the harm that it may do him,
and the present verse is meant to prohibit this.

‘*By thought*, *word or deed*.’—This communication is not for the
purpose of accomplishing some unseen result. The meaning is that he
should show by his actual deed that he has acted in strict accordance
with the permission accorded to him.

Or, the verse may be construed as—‘whatever act for the sake of the next
life he does, by thought word or deed, that he should make known to
them.’—(236)

explains ‘*pāratryam*’ as ‘acts pertaining to the other world, spiritual
acts.’

All that ought to be done by man is finished on these three; this is the highest direct duty; every other is a subordinate duty.—(237)

The particle ‘*iti*’ (‘*all*’)denotes the end, and signifies entirety.

Whatever there is that ought to be done by man, whatever there is that
is conducive to the fulfilment of man’s purpose,—all that is
‘*finished*’—becomes entirely accomplished—‘on *these three*’ being duly
propitiated.

‘*This is the highest* *duty*,’—because ‘*direct*.’

‘*Every other*,’ duty in the form of *Agnihotra* and the rest—is
‘*subordinate*.’ That is, they are like the door-keeper (leading up to
the king), and not directly like the king himself. This is a praise (of
the act of serving the father, etc.).

The prohibition of disregarding them,—the injunction of doing what is
pleasing and beneficial to them,—of not doing what may be injurious to
them,—and the non-doing of acts not injurious to them, without their
permission apart from these, all the other verses are merely
commendatory.—(237)

237	By (honouring) these three all that ought to be done by man, is accomplished; that is clearly the highest duty, every other (act) is a subordinate duty.
