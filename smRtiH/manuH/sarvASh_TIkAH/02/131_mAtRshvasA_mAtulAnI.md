These ‘*deserve to be honoured like the Teacher’s wife*’—by rising to meet them, saluting them, offering them seat and so forth.

The equality of these to the Teacher’s wife haviug been already mentioned by the phrase ‘like the Teacher’s wife,’ the addition of the words ‘*they are equal, etc*,’ is meant to indicate that one should do for these persons other things also;—such as carrying out their wishes and so forth—that one does for the Teacher’s wifìe. If this were not so indicated, the implication of the context would be that it is only in the matter of salutation that they have to be treated ‘like the Teacher’s wife.’

The text speaks of only ladies of older age; but in the case of younger ladies also the same rule of salutation has to be observed.—(131)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 458) in support of the view that the mother-in-law should be accosted with the clasping of her feet, whereby the prohibition of clasping of the feet of the mother-in-law, met with in some Smṛtis, has to be taken as referring to eases where the mother-in-law happens to be a youthful woman,—under which circumstances the Teacher’s wife also should not be clasped in the feet.
