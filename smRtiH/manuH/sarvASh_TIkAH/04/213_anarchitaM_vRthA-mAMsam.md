‘*Maleless female*,’— one who has neither husband nor son.

‘*Enemy*,’—an adversary.

‘*City-lord*’—one who is the master of a city, though not a king.

‘*Which has been sneered at*,’—over which some one has sneezed.—(213)

‘*Nagaryannam*’—‘Food given by the lord of a city, even though he may not be a king’ (Medhātithi); ‘food belonging to a whole town’ (Kullūka and Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451) which says—‘*anarcita*’ is that which is given in an insulting manner; ‘*vṛthā-māṃsa*’ is that which has not been prepared for offering to the gods and Pitṛs;—the ‘*avīrā*’ woman is one who has no husband or son; this prohibition applies to only such women as are not related to one’s self;—‘*nagaryanna*’ is the food belonging to the master of a city;—‘*avakṣuta*’ is that over which some one has sneezed.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 945);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 495), which adds the following notes:—‘*anarcita*’,—the food is so called when it is offered without due respect, to one who deserves respect;—‘*vṛthāmāṃsa*’ is that meat which has not been cooked for offering to the gods and Pitṛs;—‘*avīrā*’ is a woman without husband or sons, or grandsons or great-grandsons; this prohibition applies to the case of an unrelated woman, such being the custom, says Śūlapāṇi;—‘*dviṣat*’,—is one who causes injury;—‘*nagarī*’ is the master of a city, even though he may not be the king, says Medhātithi;—‘*patita*’ is the Brāhmaṇa-murderer and the like;—‘*avakṣutam*’—sneezed upon.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 773);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which adds the following notes:—‘*Anarcitam*’, rejected as bad,—‘*avīrā*’, a woman without husband or sons or any male relatives,—‘*nagarī*’ means a ‘person in charge of a city’,—‘*avakṣutam*’, which has been sneezed upon.
