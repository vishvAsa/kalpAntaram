One may entertain a friend at Śrāddhas, but never a foe, even though qualified. The offering eaten by the enemy becomes futile after death.—(144)

\[Medhātithi takes no note of this verse\].

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

Medhātithi omits this verse. It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 448) as permitting the feeding of the friend and others when no other Brāhmaṇa is available;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 41), which explains ‘*abhirūpam*’ as ‘learned and ‘*pretya*’ as ‘in the other world.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-तुल्य-वाक्यानि</summary>

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.17.5-6).—‘When other men with proper
qualifications are not available, one may feed even his own uterine brother; or even his own pupils.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.8.4).—‘One may feed even a Sapiṇḍa if he is equipped
with the Ṛk, the Yajuṣ and the Sāman.’

144	(If no learned Brahmana be at hand), he may rather honour a (virtuous) friend than an enemy, though the latter may be qualified (by learning and so forth); for sacrificial food, eaten by a foe, bears no reward after death.
