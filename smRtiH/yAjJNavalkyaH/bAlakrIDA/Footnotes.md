[^1]:
     The subcommentary _Vacanamālā_ provides the first line of this verse: kaścic chiṣṭo 'tikāruṇyāt sarvadharmāgamārthavit |

[^2]:
     See AitB 5.32 (25.7). The reading here should be _ṛkto _in place of _ukto._

[^3]:
     Here the printed edition is blurred and the reading is not quite certain.

[^4]:
     Editor's note: apasīmantonnayanā sīmantonnayanavyatiriktāḥ.

[^5]:
     In the Munshiram Manoharlal reprint of 1982 this word has been changed to what appears to be: avagaktavāṃ.

[^6]:
     Ascribed to Bhṛgu in the _Vacanamālā: _snānāni pañca puṇyāni kīrtitāni manīṣibhiḥ | āgneyaṃ vāruṇaṃ brāhmaṃ vāyavyaṃ divyam eva ca ||

[^7]:
     The edition reads _apūrvam_, which I think is a typo.

[^8]:
     The two pādas in this sentence probably constitute the second half of verse ascribed to Vasiṣṭha give above.

[^9]:
     Ganapati Sastri's edition places here (na?), assuming that there should be a negative here. But we already have the negative in -anapākaraṇa-; the son, because he does not know the details of the document cannot eliminate its defects.

[^10]:
     The Vulgate has this reading for pāda-d: dhanabhāg vā dhanī bhavet.

[^11]:
     The printed edition reads "tv eṣāṃ", but, as I have noted in my edition of the YDh, this is probably a typo. The Malayalam manuscripts I used in the edition and on which the Viśva edition is based have "ceṣṭāṃ".

[^12]:
     Even though the printed text of Viśva reads: _vedavidyābhiḥ sāttviko_, the commentary itself clearly shows the reading _yāti_: _vedavic ca yaḥ sa sātviko devayoniṣu yāti_. The reading of the edition is probably a typo.

[^13]:
     Edition reads "sāmarthād" but I think it is a typo.

[^14]:
     The edition reads: kṛtvāpratyakṣaśrutivacanād, that is, "apratyakṣaśruti". I think this reading is doubtful, and the sandhi here is probably a typo.

[^15]:
     The edition is faulty here: _kṛtvasujviṣayā ttisiddhyartham_. Clearly an _akṣara_ is missing between the two compounds. The statement _kṛtvasuc_ refers to Pāṇini 5.4.17: _saṅkhyāyāḥ kriyābhyāvr̥ttigaṇane kr̥tvasuc_._ _It appears likely that here the reference is to _āvṛtti _of the Pāṇini's rule. I think Madhav Deshpande for his help in resolving this problem.

[^16]:
     The editions of VaDh read: "ajito".

[^17]:
     The edition here reads "tathāreyā", which is probably a typo.

[^18]:
     The edition here reads "vyākhyāne", which is probably a typo.

[^19]:
     Verses 261 and 262 are omitted in the critical edition. I note there that these two verses are probably part of the commentary rather than verses within the root text.

[^20]:
     The edition reads "pāṇamāsā"; probably a typo.
